  "detailedContent": "Tech firm Republic has recently announced its mission to democratize private market investing, with the selection of Avalanche as the platform for launching its profit-sharing digital asset, the Republic Note (R/Note). The R/Note is a revenue-sharing digital security that is backed by Republic’s private equity portfolio, which includes over 750 assets. According to Republic’s announcement, Avalanche was chosen for several key reasons. Firstly, its scalability and speed ensure that Republic Note holders can enjoy seamless and cost-effective transactions. Notably, Avalanche has established partnerships with renowned brands like Amazon Web Services and Mastercard, highlighting its technical capabilities. Additionally, Republic plans to launch a dedicated Subnet on Avalanche next year, offering a purpose-built network specifically designed for the Republic Note. This will provide enhanced security, privacy, and regulatory compliance, creating a robust digital security environment. Mission alignment between Republic and Ava Labs, the team behind Avalanche, is another crucial factor. Per the announcement, both entities share a commitment to fostering a more inclusive future for financial markets through tokenization. Furthermore, Avalanche’s “eco-friendliness” sets it apart from other blockchains, consuming significantly less energy, per the announcement. The pre-sale of Republic Notes has already attracted participation from thousands of individual retail investors, resulting in pre-sales exceeding $30 million. The public listing of the Republic Note is scheduled for December. The partnership between Republic and Ava Labs is anticipated to have a positive impact on the AVAX price. The launch of the Republic Note on Avalanche’s platform establishes a strong foundation for expanding its reach to a global audience of investors. Despite a 5% decline in the past 24 hours, AVAX has outperformed major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), with a 130% rally over the past 30 days, positioning itself as one of the industry’s top performers. However, it is important to note that AVAX has recently undergone a correction, and its ability to surpass the $20.64 level will be crucial in determining its prospects amidst the ongoing bullish momentum. Resistance levels at $21.59 and $22.74 have proven challenging for AVAX to breach and consolidate since February 2023. Overall, the forthcoming launch of the Republic Note on Avalanche’s mainnet is a significant milestone in making the asset accessible to pre-sale participants who have contributed over $30 million. It remains to be seen whether this partnership can further bolster AVAX’s price and reinforce the positive trend observed over the past 30 days, potentially driving AVAX to new yearly highs in 2023. The collaboration between Republic and Ava Labs underscores their shared vision of democratizing access to private markets through tokenization.

  "detailedContent": "The ever-evolving blockchain technology has been around for over a decade now, but there are still various obstacles need to be addressed, such as its lack of scalability, interoperability, security and usability. Cryptographic Object Resource Engine (CORE) is a project that tries to break through these technical limitations which current blockchain solutions are facing by using some cutting-edge technologies. “Powered by the CMCX token, CORE will provide the foundation for the future of blockchain technology allowing all blockchains, past and present to seamlessly scale and communicate,” written in the CORE Paper, an introduction to Cryptographic Object Resource Engine. It is a grand vision that the CORE project wants to accomplish, to reach the ultimate goal, CORE created and combined some of the most advanced technologies like AI, State sharding, an enhanced consensus mechanism called APBFT, Aura Layer, Apeirogon framework and so on. Besides these technical aspects, the CORE native token (CMCX) also plays an essential role in creating a user-driven blockchain and building a truly community-centric platform. To further expand its business and draw more attention in the market, CMCX will be listed on several exchanges including LBank Exchange. By integrating and collaborating with different platforms and tokens, CORE can tap into the support of the broader community of followers it intends to build. The structure of CORE network There are three fundamental parts structuring the CORE network — Pivot Chain, Poly Chains, and Bridges. Pivot Chain is the foundation of the CORE platform, it controls the entire network and is responsible for security, consensus, and monitoring. Poly Chains run simultaneously on CORE platform, they either form instances of an existing blockchain or are independent blockchains with autonomous use cases and tokens. And there are also Bridges that allow Poly Chains, both private and public, to connect with other public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, without the use of oracles. A network powered by AI One of the most fascinating features of the CORE project is its usage of AI in the network. This AI model contained at the core of its blockchain helps the network reach consensus effectively and reduces the network’s overall byzantine fault, which eventually speeds up the network’s collective transaction processing times and also enables the network to operate under attacks or faults. CORE’s AI model coordinates the various roles of each node on the network with a trust rating system, which can decide nodes’ accessibility to vital roles such as validator, observer, defender, nominator and collator. It also strengthens the security of the CORE blockchain, by randomly selecting nodes to test and collate information that identifies corrupt nodes. Higher level of scalability via sharding Sharding is a scaling solution that can increase the throughput of a blockchain drastically, but usually there are some potential issues around blockchain sharding including the validation of a blockchain’s state and the security risk in the reduction of nodes. CORE’s heterogeneous sharding model proposes a secure way for adapting each shard for a specific use case. It not only resolves the high latency and low throughput of cross-shard transactions by using a two-phase commit protocol, but also addresses the lack of validity and security of shard data using erasure codes and polynomial coded sharding. One dimension of sharding present in the CORE blockchain is State sharding. It guarantees that double spending cannot occur, and increases the transaction throughput of the CORE blockchain significantly compared to existing blockchain technology. An enhanced consensus mechanism CORE created Accelerated Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (APBFT) consensus mechanism, which enhances PBFT by reducing the communication complexity within it to address the scalability issue of it. With this enhanced consensus mechanism, each node of CORE network no longer needs to receive and count each of the remaining validators’ votes in the network but instead only receives the one multi-signature. Building an internet of blockchains There are lots of other cutting-edge technologies also being used in CORE project, such as Aura Layer – a unique Layer 2 scaling solution, Apeirogon framework – a robust, optimized, and efficient solution for custom blockchain development needs and so on. The CMCX token of CORE project enables users to vote within the platform for management and developer teams. By being listed on platforms like LBank Exchange, CMCX can reach a wider range of people, and eventually boost CORE’s speed of building a larger global blockchain community. All these advanced technologies, tokenomics, and communities will help CORE to accomplish the vision of building an internet of blockchains. Contact Details: LBK Blockchain Co.

  "title": "Mech Master: The First Mecha Game on Blockchain with an NFT Twist",
  "detailedContent": "The age of BFT has arrived and almost every other mainstream brand, celebrities and superstars have indulged into the NFT world this year. The NFT ecosystem has come a long way from just people tokenizing prized possessions, art and music, the ecosystem is entering towards P2E gaming. Play-to-earn was the original concept and use case for NFT when it was launched in 2017, and it is back in trend with a lot more eyeballs and billions of markets to grab for. Mech Master, an upcoming P2E NFT project is doing exactly that with its first-ever 3D Turn-based Mecha Blockchain game, with strategic RPG elements, where users can earn tokens through skillful gameplay and smart trading.  Relic – A main character of Mech Master game The gameplay allows players to assemble a lineup full of giant Mechas with gorgeous 3D models to battle against others, recruit new pilots, collect new lightsabers and energy cannons, show off tactical prowess and much more. Being a blockchain game in a sci-fi setting, not only combat arenas will earn players rewards in the form of rare NFTs, but one can also profit from battles by earning Mech tokens. Mech Master has one of the most enormous libraries of assets that players can trade around to build the strongest Mecha lineup. Almost every item in the game is created by players, from materials found by players. They will become players’ own unique assets which can be very valuable on the trade market. Mech Master is the Mecha game with the first-ever complex 3D rendering characters on a blockchain. Its notch art \u0026 design are better than 100% of current games on blockchain currently on the market. To celebrate the release of Mech Master, we’re going to do an airdrop event with a total prize pool of 85,000 $MECH and other special rewards. The Mech Master involves engrossing gameplay, with various levels to build an army from the massive library of Mechanics, pilots, and equipment, along with many other elements such as command and weather, make each battle a unique experience and push your tactical genius to the world. After each battle, the participated players will need to pay a fee based on the amount of resources earned. This fee will be shared equally among all BattleField owners. Mech Token and other resources such as minerals, gold will be rewarded after each battle. Players can use those resources to produce new Mechas, new equipment and then trade with other players on the Mech Master market.  Moonland is exactly what it sounds like, users can buy a virtual plot of land on the moon via the Mech Master game. Moon would act as the base for several battles in the game and players can purchase plots of land and build their towns on the moon. They can build strongholds, factories, barracks, facilities and expand their economy and mechanize the army. Moonabase would not just be a collectible in the game, rather it would play a critical role in the gameplay. After owning a land plot, players can build their own Moonbase, build facilities, create new Mechas, weapons, pilots, and mine Dark Matter. Each Moonland plot will have a unique mining output, determining how much Dark Matter players can mine each day. Dark Matter would act as the fuel of the gameplay,and it would be widely used in almost every activity on Moon Land, from building facilities, powering Mechas, producing equipment, and discovering new Mecha skills, etc.  Mech Master universe being a P2E NFT game comprises numerous unique and NFT collectibles representing characters, machines, land, and different kinds of items in the Mech Master game. There are multiple tiers of collectibles each representing a different value and uniqueness. The more unique an NFT, the harder it is to get in the gameplay. One of the more important NFTs is called Mecha NFT which is an ERC-721 NFT collectible. It represents a giant fighting machine in the Mech universe. This is the centerpiece of Mech Master’s gameplay, as players will use their Mechas to compete with others. There are 5 tiers of the rarity of Mecha, Equipment, and Pilot. Apart from these five there will also be two special tiers for: There will be a different NFT category for different roles and according to gameplay. For example a Pilot is an ERC-721 collectible representing a character who can control the Mecha. Training for a new Mecha pilot is an exceedingly tough task and requires a lot of resources. But the advantages each pilot brings to the Mecha are indisputable. Each Pilot has a special ability, and when combined with the suitable Mecha, they will create an unstoppable duo. Similarly, Moonbase has its own NFT which is an ERC-721 NFT collectible representing a piece of land on the moon. There is only one Moon in the Mech universe, so the number of Moonbase is limited. Moonbase is required to build any Settlement. Please refer to the Settlement for more detail. Mech Master takes the P2E ecosystem to the next level with its gameplay and unique NFT collectible formula. While there are numerous projects trying to bank on the NFT rush, only the likes of Mech Master has the best of both worlds to succeed in the next generation of NFT projects i.e engrossing gameplay that can attract hardcore gamers as well as leisure ones, while NFT collectibles give an opportunity of investment.

  "title": "Demole is Taking NFT Gaming Beyond the Blockchain",
  "detailedContent": "The proliferation of consumer-grade PC hardware and smartphones pushed the global gaming industry to a valuation of $300 billion in 2021, making video games a more popular form of entertainment than the American film industry. Running parallel to this rise in the popularity of gaming is the explosion of the decentralized finance (DeFi) market, and more recently, the emergence of gamefi, a revolution in blockchain-based gaming which adds an economic spin to what has till now been mere entertainment. The exclusivity of non-fungible token technology makes NFTs a solid foundation upon which to build unique, bespoke player experiences. However, bridging the gap between a novel, emerging technology and the existing global gaming industry has, until now, proven to be a difficult task. Demole is the first 3D role-playing game based on NFT technology in the world and operates on a play-to-earn basis. It pits player-characters against one another in a PvP environment and pulls together a range of popular gaming mechanics prevalent in triple-A games, such as campaign storylines, resource crafting, arena battles, progressive upgrades, boss battles, a player-operated item marketplace, and more. Recognizing that the global gaming industry exploded largely due to the popularity of smartphone gaming, Demole expands the traditionally PC-based NFT gaming sector into the mobile arena. Demole, which functions as an acronym for Defi Monster Legends, threatens to be the first project to bridge the $300 billion gap between blockchain gaming and its non-blockchain counterparts, thanks to both its mobile focus and an ability to let players earn money as they play. Major video-game publishers have in recent years doubled-down on their tactic of forcing players to pay for game content that would previously have shipped with the base game as standard. Rather than play-to-earn, major developers instead install a pay-to-play mechanism, where certain content is only available to those willing to pay extra. This sales tactic is frequently indistinguishable from gambling, as witnessed with the now normalized loot-box phenomena – a trend which seems doubly pernicious when one considers that its targets are usually children. Blockchain-based NFT gaming has threatened to democratize and liberate gaming culture from these profiteering tactics, however, its failure to meet the graphical and gameplay standards of the existing gaming market has thus far halted its spread. Demole aims to connect the traditional gaming market with that of the blockchain-based NFT space by offering the range of features the average gamer has come to expect. Along with graphical fidelity and mobile compatibility, this includes a rich storyline on par with popular modern games, in-game communication, diverse content and missions, and the inclusion of one of the most popular genres in gaming today: RPGs. Built on the cryptocurrency space’s DeFi home, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Demole offers players a low barrier to entry and modest gas fees for in-game activities. What’s more, its burning and revenue sharing model means it’s not just gamers who can benefit from Demole and its native $DMLG token. Regularly scheduled token burns boost the value of the native token, allowing passive holders to benefit from the popularity of the game. Holders can also opt to stake their tokens to accumulate passive returns. The team behind Demole has long and varied histories in mobile gaming, blockchain development, and marketing and finance. The development of Demole is overseen by four different teams of specialists, dividing up responsibilities between blockchain developers, digital game artists, a marketing team, and a finance team. This specialization of responsibilities, along with its play-to-earn model – and a willingness to aim higher than the NFT space alone – is what the Demole team hopes will push the mobile RPG into the hands of eager gamers worldwide, whether they’re blockchain enthusiasts or not.

  "detailedContent": "TRON is a robust blockchain platform built and maintained by blockchain experts all over the globe that adheres to the “Decentralize the Web” concept. TRON ecosystem is a variety of goods such as blockchain systems, wallet clients, decentralized apps (DAPPs), etc. These substances are inextricably linked, and when combined, they contribute to the overall stability of the ecosystem. TRON public chain is a decentralized blockchain communication network just on TRON protocol that serves as the heart of the TRON ecosystem and was released on June 25th, 2018. Because of its well-designed structure \u0026 code, the TRON public chain offers higher operating performance and accuracy than other public chains. In a recent Tweet of TRON in the weekly report, TRON Blockchain height exceeded 34.15 million. The total number of accounts on TRON reached 55,531, 038. The Total Number of Transactions on TRON reached $10.5 billion. And Moonstake Wallet now Supports Staking of TRON $TRX.

  "title": "How Intellectual property could be Transferred through the Blockchain Ecosystem",
  "detailedContent": "While the world has evolved from storing and transferring information from paper to cloud storage, data is still not entirely protected. The existing cloud storage system used for sharing information while encrypted is centralized, and centralized systems have the inherent disadvantage of being vulnerable to hacks and attacks. However, decentralized solutions such as blockchain technology have become an excellent alternative because of their immutability. Sharing intellectual property through the blockchain network can create a more secure and reliable system because of its several advantages. The centralized intellectual property storage and management system suffer from outdated technology, improper management and recording of the files. Most of these systems rely on manual input of data which is not only prone to error but also lacks the precise and efficient output. Moreover, most of the centralized IP storage systems utilize cloud storage or offline storage as paperwork, which both limit interconnectivity and are insecure methods. Cloud storage systems are prone to hacking because of a lack of a robust encryption mechanism and are not considered to be legally accepted when proving a chain of custody. On the other hand, the paper trail can easily be manipulated making it less reliable which is a growing concern in the Intellectual Property management industry. The world is quickly moving to a more reliable and secure means of storing, managing and validating intellectual property, which is using blockchain. Blockchain is a digital ledger used to record information such as cryptocurrency transactions. As the name suggests, Blockchain is a growing list of blocks that stores record linked using cryptography. Every block contains a cryptographic hash linked to the previous block, transaction data, and a timestamp for the data. While created as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, blockchain has found use cases beyond the original intention. The data recorded on the blockchain has a timestamp and cannot be edited once registered; it creates a perfect solution to record data. Time-consuming and costly disputes about the origin of an invention or copyright of intellectual property can quickly be resolved if recorded on the blockchain as they have a timestamp. Moreover, licensing agreements can be created and recorded using smart contracts to develop immutable proof. Moreover, blockchain offers expert security as it is maintained by validators or nodes based in different parts of the world to keep the network decentralized. It can also be used to identify counterfeit goods by attaching blockchain tags to them. NFTs are a product of blockchain technology widely used to secure the ownership and copyright of an asset or intellectual property. Blockchain is also helpful in speeding up the contract signing process, due diligence and file validation processes, as expertly demonstrated by KwikTrust.

  "detailedContent": "Cryptocurrencies have an isolated existence. Designed to be decentralized and work independently, they either have their own separate blockchain ecosystem or run off of other larger ones such as Ethereum and BSC. This essentially means that one token cannot interact with another if they run on different ecosystems. As more and more tokens are launched coupled with increased interest due to DeFi, the struggle is getting more serious. And that’s where Exzo Network project is committed to promoting the adoption of cryptocurrencies by providing products and services that are useful and easy to use. Stefan G. Creadore the founder and developer of the Exzo Network is happy to announce the development of its ExzoSwap Crypto Wallet + DEX and Exzo Network Blockchain. Exzo Network will be the platform that provides a wide range of blockchain and DeFi opportunities for users from swapping tokens between different blockchains and earning profits from staking to creating fully-functional dApps written in Solidity and fully compatible with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Initially Exzo Network ecosystem will be a fork of Fantom Network (https://fantom.foundation/). Exzo Network is developing the next generation of blockchain technology implementing a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism that will enable interaction with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) for a high throughput, scalable, low-cost alternative to the Ethereum Mainnet. ExzoCoin plans to launch their non-custodial secure crypto and altcoin wallet on the IOS and Android app stores in the upcoming month. The ExzoSwap crypto wallet will feature a decentralized exchange with the 1Inch API integrated, along with a voting platform for alternative cryptocurrencies and new projects to get their communities involved in. ExzoSwap will also have features including live price data, 24 hour trading volume, opening and closing price, and other features for improving the crypto investor’s experience. Users will be able to access extended functionalities on the ExzoSwap crypto wallet by purchasing ExzoCoin 2.0 (EXZO), which is currently on the BSC utilizing Pancakeswap VS. (Smart contract address: 0xF8fC63200e181439823251020d691312FDcF5090). The Exzo Network will launch a web-based cryptocurrency and altcoin swapping platform that enables users to trade cryptocurrencies on the Ethereum Mainnet, BSC, and polygon network. As well as view live altcoin prices and live cryptocurrency prices, along with trending crypto news, recent transactions, and more. The expected launch for this platform is 1-2 Months. ExzoCoin 2.0 (EXZO) is a utility token that is utilized on the Exzo Networks secure crypto wallet and decentralized exchange to gain access to extended features and functionalities within the Exzo Network ecosystem. ExzoCoin 2.0 (EXZO) has had a security audit conducted by Certik.io (https://leaderboard.certik.io/projects/exzocoin) to ensure the smart contract doesn’t hold any malicious code or errors within its functionality. EXZO holders also gain reflections for holding the token as a customer reward/loyalty system.

  "title": "Blockchain Networks Featuring Smartphone Compatible Nodes Are Gradually Changing the Game for Small Players",
  "detailedContent": "The crypto ecosystem has positioned itself as a disruptive niche to the centralized, traditional finance architecture. This upcoming decentralized market is based on blockchain technology, whose fundamental infrastructure is supported by several nodes instead of an overarching central authority. Blockchain nodes can be compared to small servers – their primary role is to store the blocks of data that make up a blockchain network. These decentralized nodes are connected and facilitate the exchange of the latest blockchain data for the network to stay updated. Simply put, nodes are the support system of blockchain environments. While the concept may sound technical, a node can be a computer, laptop, or other devices, including smartphones. Today, we have many blockchain networks such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin whose operations are facilitated by node validators. The process of node validation involves allocating resources such as memory and computational power to store data and verify transactions that are added to a blockchain network. For instance, the Bitcoin blockchain uses a Proof-of-work (PoW) consensus, requiring miners to allocate resources for transaction validation and secure the network. In return, the miners are rewarded with network rewards for each block added to the blockchain. Currently, the network reward on the Bitcoin network is at 6.25 BTC following the May 2020 halving. Similarly, Ethereum and Dogecoin blockchain networks depend on node validators to function effectively. There are two major types of nodes; complete and lightweight. The former enforces all the rules of a particular blockchain network, while the latter references data from the full blockchain nodes. With lightweight nodes, users can run a node without storing the entire block data. However, these nodes are not as trustless as full nodes. Running a blockchain node can be pretty expensive for small-time players despite being a lucrative opportunity for crypto stakeholders. The Bitcoin blockchain, which is currently the biggest, requires at least 2 gigabytes of memory and 500 gigabytes SSD or HDD. In addition, node validators require a fast internet connection of at least 50 Kbps, not to mention that Bitcoin’s blockchain scales at an average of 1 GB every week. Even meme networks such as Dogecoin are still out of the reach of most stakeholders looking to run a full blockchain node. Dogecoin’s network requires node validators to have at least a free disk space of 50 gigabytes and 2 gigabytes of memory (RAM). This is quite a stretch for the majority of the world’s population, given that only a few have access to sophisticated devices that can handle node validation. It is no surprise that environmental advocates have been criticizing the energy used to mine PoW cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Tesla’s Elon Musk was among the leading critics. The company withdrew from its position to accept Bitcoin payments until miners prove that over 50% of the energy comes from clean energy. Today, the blockchain ecosystem has evolved to feature several networks where users can run cost-friendly nodes. Protocols such as Minima Global introduce ultra-lean blockchain environments that can fit on IoT or mobile devices. This decentralized network creates the possibility of an inclusive, scalable, secure and resilient blockchain protocol by allowing users to run full constructing and validating nodes from their smartphone devices. With the number of smartphone users globally currently at 3.8 billion, Minima taps into the potential of this burgeoning market to further decentralize its blockchain network. In doing so, the protocol has created the possibility of a censorship-resistant blockchain network that is truly autonomous and accountable. For a long time, the traditional financial market has had to deal with the shortcomings of a centralized ecosystem. Some of which include limited access to financial services due to cumbersome KYC processes and other nuances. Cryptocurrencies are changing the narrative by introducing a decentralized ecosystem where everyone globally can participate in one way or another. This paradigm shift requires efficient supporting structures, starting with nodes that form a core part of blockchain environments. Therefore, it is only logical for crypto stakeholders to make node validation a cost-friendly affair. This will improve the chances of scaling the decentralized aspect of existing blockchain networks. That said, upcoming blockchain designs featuring smartphone compatibility could provide a solid solution. Essentially, building blockchain networks with mainstream adoption in mind will likely hasten the growth of decentralized networks. Furthermore, smartphone-compatible blockchain nodes offer a significant value proposition to small-time players that have been victims of the current system.",

  "title": "BNB Fintech: The Blockchain-Based Solution to Payments System | NewsBTC",
  "detailedContent": "Payment systems have for years been helping buyers, merchants and investors complete their trades. However, some face issues like fraud, cross-border transactions complexities, limited currency options, and others. However, a new project, BNB Fintech, launches to provide a payment system free from such issues. BNB fintech is a crypto innovation whose primary intention is to disrupt payment systems. It comes with a vast array of payment-related services to ensure it hubs and supports different kinds of payments. The network’s base is the Binance Smart Chain. Thus, BNB Fintech will decentralize and streamline the payment process. By basing services on a blockchain, this network will end fraud, cross-border transactions, and other problems. As a payment system, BNB Fintech will offer low fee transactions at high security. When providing services, the BNB Fintech inculcates several features that bring the payment systems to everyone. Among the top features include; A marketplace is an online shop where people can buy goods and exchange services. P2P(peer to peer) is an exchange that involves a direct interaction between the buyer and seller. Most marketplaces use fiat payment options, but BNB Fintech is introducing a unique system. BNB Fintech is launching a P2P marketplace where people will pay for goods using crypto. In the entire BNB fintech marketplace, the BNB Cash coin will be the most primary currency of the network. The token will help in trade and purchases. BNB Fintech will be adding more and more tokens in the future to increase convenience, thus solving the issue of limited currencies. Statistics show that at the end of 2020, there were over 2.4 billion Visa Debit cards globally. Indeed, a big chunk of the global population uses debit cards. BNB Fintech introduces its native debit card system. They will work with networks like Simplex to help to link BNB Cash to debit card services. Hence, customers will have a good experience paying for gas, coffee, and other household items. Of course, to make things easy for users, BNB Fintech will introduce a POS system. According to the BNB Fintech whitepaper, the primary purpose of the POS system will be to boost the transaction flow of BNB Cash via the merchants. Merchants, buyers, and other parties will use the point of sale system in crypto payments. Thus, there will be an easy real-time flow of crypto transactions. The final product in BNB Fintech’s initial plan is the wallet. In BNB Fintech, the wallet has an entirely different meaning. It’s a tool that hubs all developments. Thus, users can get a one-stop shop for all the services. Wallet users can track their points, expenditure behaviour, and purchase in exchanges. BNB Fintech plans to launch the first three services before the wallet. Once all the services launch, the wallet will have higher demand. BNB Fintech has a unique token called BNB Cash that runs the entire platform services. The POS, marketplace, debit card, and wallet will all depend on this coin. According to their website, the BNB fintech has a total of 200 million tokens. This coin has a $BNBCH ticker symbol. The 200 million tokens are distributed as follows; One exciting thing about this network is the transaction tax. Generally, in every transaction, BNB Fintech will charge a low 4% tax. It apportions the tax in the following ways; BNB Fintech has a team of experts in different fields who combine efforts to create a highly efficient network. Among the top team members associated with the project include; BNB Fintech has long-term hiring plans to ensure it reaches the crypto market as soon as possible. The fact that they put their team publicly clearly shows that the BNB team aims to be utterly transparent. BNB Fintech is a promising project, especially in the payment space. The most noteworthy thing about this project is its crypto and blockchain base. Since blockchain helps solve payment flaws, this system will genuinely gain adoption in the long run. The BNB fintech introduces 4 top payment-related services, namely, P2P crypto marketplace, Debit cards, POS system, and wallet. Its BNB Cash token is another tool that will help in streamlining the payment systems. One interesting thing is that BNB Fintech will partner with other tokens to provide more options for payment. This project is still in its early stages. Hence the team is in constant communication with community members.

  "detailedContent": "Stronghands was launched over 5 years ago, as a fork of peercoin / Bitcoin core with stake features. With new purposes, it had its takeover in mid- 2017, headed by Michael Larry-Reed and his dev team at that time, and since then, other community partners, including Alex Freire, Valter Ribeiro and Thomas Orr Tucker (in memory), have worked on the constant development of this project, in order to build a complete ecosystem, which the main objective is to bring economic freedom, opening doors for the real decentralized economy, outside the old financial institutions. The project has as its main goal to bring economic freedom to everyone. It manages decentralized, anonymous and censorship-free blockchain structures that offer a wide range of opportunities to profit, a crosschain infrastructure offers you: staking, mint, mining, earning from masternodes, yield farms, APR, liquid pools and so on. “The expectation for StrongHands is that it will be among the top 100 coins at Coinmarketcap by 2025. StrongHands’s ecosystem is complex and robust, we seek to have a continuous growth, aiming to achieve all of our current goals: launch a decentralized non-custodial exchange, bring reliable income to the community holders, be one of the best investment option in the crypto market and to have a strong global community” Valter Dias – CFO StrongHands Blockchain Infrastructure is currently running on: SHND (stronghands) SHND (peercoin/bitcoin fork) is the main blockchain, with stake features. It is based on POS (proof-of-stake). It is an energy-efficient blockchain, You can stake by running a full node wallet in your computer, or POW mining by participating in the mining Pools. SHMN (stronghands Masternode) Fork of PIVX, SHMN is a masternode blockchain. Masternodes are similar to stake, but offer an attractive ROI .

  "title": "Is An Energy-Efficient PoW-Based Blockchain Possible?",
  "detailedContent": "The emergence of cryptocurrency has disrupted the traditional financial industry and captivated the world while doing so. The decentralization movement does not only prevent fraud, but for those living under authoritarian governments, it can provide a medium of exchange resistant to censorship, giving a crucial means of financial freedom. Although cryptocurrency has been lauded for its technological advancements, it hasn’t come without its moments of scrutiny. In May, Elon Musk decided to stop accepting Bitcoin as payment for Tesla, tweeting that he was concerned about the “rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for bitcoin mining.”  This is because the top cryptocurrencies—including Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ethereum—require large amounts of energy consumption to function. In 2020, a report showed that Bitcoin was on track to use more energy than that of 159 countries combined. It’s no wonder that people like Musk are advocating for greener alternatives. Despite the fact that most new technology comes with trade-offs, the issue has sparked a conversation about how blockchains can further move towards environmentally friendly practices. This is where Proof-of-Work (PoW) or Proof-of-Stake (PoS) gets interesting regarding the environmental impact of a blockchain. Both PoW and PoS algorithms can have a direct effect on energy usage. However, PoW is typically known to require a more significant amount of energy since miners need to sell their coins to pay their bills. PoW was created as the original consensus algorithm for blockchain and is used to confirm transactions and add new blocks to the chain for data storage. Alternatively, PoS works off the percentage of coins held by a miner. Cryptocurrencies have adopted it to maximize energy efficiency because it usually has significantly lower consumption levels since miners aren’t required to solve complex mathematical problems, like in PoW blockchains. For this reason, PoS has been the default choice for the majority of newer blockchains. With that being said, the argument that PoW-driven blockchains are unable to provide mining solutions that are energy efficient is not entirely accurate. With advances in scalability, new PoW technology has emerged that allows this form of mining to be as environmentally friendly and secure as PoS. Though PoS blockchains might appear to be better for the environment on the surface, upon closer inspection, they pose multiple problems due to their lack of scalability. On the other hand, while PoW-based blockchains appear to use more power initially, they can also very much have the potential to be greener and more secure than PoS-based blockchains. During the blockchain boom, while most players in the industry opted for the promises PoS mechanisms offered of high energy efficiency, one organization, Kadena, focused its efforts on scalability and dedicated its time to building a more robust underlying blockchain solution. While blockchains using PoS argue that PoW isn’t sustainable, the most critical factor contributing to PoW’s energy efficiency is the transactions per second (TPS). Kadena claims it has the capability to push up to 100,000 TPS, which will be confirmed in testing later this year. This will not only be a groundbreaking speed but also make it the only scalable PoW blockchain to exist. Compared to PoS, which can sometimes only achieve 10 TPS, this is a much faster and environmentally friendly protocol.  Many PoS systems that had high hopes for PoS solving surface-level problems are now faltering. This week, Solana crashed under high demand, Arbitrum was taken offline, and Ethereum was attacked. As the flaws in the PoS-based blockchains begin to be exposed and the need for a more sustainable solution becomes increasingly pressing, Kadena, the only sharded and scalable layer-1 PoW public network offer a robust solution to the masses. Learn more about how this leading blockchain is disrupting the DeFi space on Kadena’s website.",

  "detailedContent": "Africa’s first Enterprise Blockchain Infrastructure Services organization, signs a long-term strategic partnership agreement with Africa’s first Fintech Unicorn to develop Blockchain-powered Infrastructure Services and Solutions. Interstellar and Interswitch have been working together over the last two years, carrying out blockchain technology research. As part of the partnership, Interstellar’s Blockchain technology stack called STARGATE will be integrated with Interswitch’s industry-leading payments and digital commerce technology. This will advance the shared vision of the businesses to drive greater financial inclusion and prosperity across the continent. Both companies have been preparing for the blockchain revolution in the African market with several ongoing initiatives including a Pan African Payment Ecosystem (PAPE) powered by a private permissioned blockchain network which includes a consortium of Banks and Fintech players. Ernest Mbenkum, Founder and CEO at Interstellar, commented, “We are delighted to have established this strategic partnership with Interswitch, one of Africa’s most valuable fintech businesses. This marks the genesis of an innovative and collaborative partnership aimed at delivering impact-focused and enterprise grade blockchain-powered services across the African continent.” Interswitch has been at the forefront of major innovation milestones in payments in Nigeria for the last 20 years, garnering recognition along the line as one of the fastest-growing technology companies in Africa (Deloitte Fast-Growth 50) and gaining acclaim as the first homegrown African Fintech Unicorn following a minority investment by Visa in late 2019. Today, Interswitch’s current business footprint covers more than 26 countries in Africa. Akeem Lawal, Divisional Chief Executive Officer for Transaction Switching and Payment Processing at Interswitch commented, “We are excited to partner with Interstellar on this journey and we look forward to the amazing things we will achieve together in the African market. This new alliance underscores the directional evolution of our blockchain innovation strategy which is premised on 3 core pillars: The adoption of distributed ledger technology applications in Africa offers significant potential for advancing socio-economic growth, empowerment of communities, digitization of industries, lowering the costs of local and cross border payments, localization of emerging technology and the development of African tech talent. Looking at recent trends, the African continent has been seen to be progressively embracing contemporary innovation in digital currency, with Central Banks and other payment service providers actively championing some of these interventions. These trends present multiple advantages and opportunities for deepening payment systems across the continent, and this timely partnership between Interswitch and Interstellar represents another significant milestone in the journey.

  "detailedContent": "Something exciting and innovative is coming out of Sweden, and it might just sweep across the world. No, this has nothing to do with IKEA or Abba’s reunion tour. This is a fun and addictive trivia game that rewards participants for playing and winning in cryptocurrency! Sons of Mim is a Swedish game studio created with the vision of developing knowledge games that are built with blockchain technology. By the end of October, the company will be launching a Mimir Quiz – the world’s first quiz game powered by blockchain technology.

Being the first mover in the crypto market, with a game that is not only accessible worldwide, Mimir Quiz has proven to attract many players from all walks of life. Mimir Quiz is on its way to being the first breakout game in the cryptosphere that will gain mass-market adoption.

Users from all over the world will be able to join daily quiz tournaments broadcasted from Stockholm, Sweden. The live tournaments are a super exciting and social experience that tests your knowledge on a wide variety of topics. Just like HQ Trivia, it is a knock-out game with 10-15 questions where the ultimate goal is to make it all the way through to be one of the winners. Instead of sitting on the couch watching people on TV answer questions and winning money, the Mimir Live Quiz will let YOU be part of the show! Players from all over the globe will compete for huge prizes in Mimir Tokens with real monetary value directly on their smartphones, all thanks to the power of blockchain technology! Mimir Quiz has introduced a unique new feature where players can discover a Mimir play-to-earn model and be rewarded in Mimir Tokens for their playtime and activity, completing tasks and achievements as well as winning quiz games.

It is also being designed using the Polygon layer-two solution for scalability, efficient gas fees, and cross-chain capability. An essential part of the company’s gaming ecosystem is the Mimir token.

In total there will only be 100,000,000 Mimir tokens minted, generating a scarcity that is lacking in many new cryptocurrencies. And with the tokenomics governing the allocation of tokens, the team has set forth a new precedent on the market where they Alongside the token, each user will through the sign-up process create their MetaMask wallet. This will enable users to seamlessly interact with all the in-game functions of the Mimir Quiz which includes playing, staking, earning, and receiving tokens. With the innovative play-to-earn model that acts as the guiding light for the project, the Mimir Quiz aims to transform the way knowledge-based and skillful gaming is rewarded.

  "title": "The 100x ROI for Gamezone’s $GZONE Confirms the Viability of Blockchain Gaming",
  "detailedContent": "Traditionally, an IDO will give investors a new token that has future profit potential. However, with Gamezone and $GZONE, the concept goes much further than that. It is a way to earn passive revenue, generate profit potential, and access the future of blockchain gaming rolled into one. Historically, numerous new token launches have surged in value and saw early investors liquidate positions relatively quickly. It can be hard to pass up on a 20x from one’s original investment, as it represents a significant profit. For GameZone’s native $GZONE token, investors treat the market somewhat differently. Even after a 100x ROI, very few people intend to sell their tokens. Nevertheless, you cannot underestimate the long-term potential of this asset. The current 100x ROI is not surprising either. GameZone is developed by the BlueZilla team, which has launched various launchpad services across prominent blockchain ecosystems. Their latest venture for Velas, dubbed VelasPad, noted a 150x ROI within the first two days, indicating there may be more to come for $GZONE. So even though the platform’s focus is different, the long-term approach can bring continuous value to the token. As $GZONE acts deflationary, it can be rewarding to hold for the long term. Stakers will earn revenue from every sale that occurs and get a cut from the fee charged to those who unstake early. Moreover, those who hold the token for the long term can unlock extra benefits, including access to new games, expansions, and Initial Game Offerings organized through GameZone. There is little incentive to consider $GZONE a “flippable” token, as the fees for selling [early] and the long-term rewards are put in place to incentivize holding. Following this successful IDO on Bluzilla’s inhouse Launchpads, the team can continue building its suite of services. The GameZone initiative is about more than a fancy website, as the BlueZilla group aims to provide various tools for developers and communities. Blockchain gaming is a prevalent trend that will likely gain even more traction in the next decade. Seeing the $GZONE IDO do a 100x ROI in the first two days is not surprising when looking at the bigger picture. GameZone encompasses a suite of tools to fuel the development and growth of blockchain games. That includes support through incubation, funding rounds, and a Grants Program. Supporting game developers across any stage of project building is crucial to unlocking the next level of innovation and revenue potential. Moreover, GameZone has different “levels” of development. During level two, the team will launch multiple white-label solutions to help developers expand their game and community. Solutions may include NFT lending, onboarding models, and new revenue-sharing options. The GameZone vision is to offer an end-to-end solution to catalyze growth and development in this nascent space.  An extra incentive for developers is how they gain access to BlueZilla’s network and resources. It is not always about money, but also legal, technical, and other forms of help, assistance, and advice. BlueZilla’s network spans dozens of partners and supporters across various industries, all of which can offer fresh insights for companies or teams building the next blockchain gaming unicorn. Make sure to keep an eye on GameZone’s Twitter, Telegram, Telegram Announcements, and Medium channels for the latest updates! ",

  "title": "Sports Tech Startup Bownce Leverages Blockchain to Bring a New Form of Motivation to the World of Fitness",
  "detailedContent": "The importance of physical activity has been dramatically underestimated these days and largely forgotten by many of us due to our busy lifestyles. However, giving up the comfortable sitting lifestyle for more physically engaging activities will benefit millions of people, and Bownce offers an appealing and affordable solution. The busy lifestyle, combined with many other responsibilities, tends to push even the very thought of leading a healthy lifestyle in the background. We cannot always find the motivation to try and fit it into our schedules, but that is OK. Again, it is a matter of making choices and sacrifices, although that doesn’t mean you should push physical activities aside entirely. However, a sports tech innovative startup, Bownce, thinks that this is the very thing we lack — the motivation itself — which is why it decided to offer it through blockchain technology. Combining a psychological aspect with an innovative IoT sports device will make you rethink sports and physical activities altogether. Engaging in physical activity can prolong your lifespan. The creative minds and experts behind Bownce understand that health is essential to many people and that sports are the key to a healthier lifestyle. However, since many can’t motivate themselves to do sports, the project aims to do it for them. More specifically, Bownce’s team has built a new and accessible workout tool that lets users see data, progress, and obtain tips for future optimization through a companion mobile app. Bownce firmly believes that sports should be easily accessible anywhere and everywhere. Moreover, the company released a sports IoT ball that allows users to engage in fun challenges and compete with others. The competitive aspect of Bownce’s product can bring together people in ways that were not possible prior. To Bownce and many others, challenges are what make it fun to work out and train. Additionally, getting rewards like professional players makes these “workouts” more exciting and engaging. It is in our human nature to keep pushing for higher scores and different goals and reap the rewards. Bownce is a sports tech startup established in 2019 in Germany that focuses on offering a new way to view fitness and lifestyle to its users. The project prepares for market entrance around Spring-Summer 2022 and is currently developing the right sports equipment to inspire people to lead healthier lifestyles. The sports tech startup’s team will launch Bownce, a digital IoT device, which was showcased during the AIBC conference in Dubai. This sports device is filled with microtechnology that will allow users to track their performance during exercise and monitor hits, power, speed, precision, and more. Of course, all of this data will synchronize with the project’s smartphone app via Bluetooth. In addition, players will gain support from Bownce and the community to increase their fitness level and relieve stress. That latter aspect, the emotional benefit Bownce’s double punching ball can provide, should not be overlooked. Based on current statistics, consumer desire to perform fitness activities outdoors has risen significantly in recent months. As many as 47% of people would prefer to train outside and elsewhere, rather than returning to the gym. Additionally, 37% of respondents have canceled their gym membership or contemplate doing so in favor of outdoor activities. Bownce aims to create a unique environment that welcomes everyone, regardless of their fitness level, age group, nationality, and location. Users from across the globe are welcome to join, while the project aims to inspire them to train, challenge themselves and others, and work out to meet and exceed those challenges. Moreover, players can engage in global competition through sports events. Participants can earn crypto tokens, adding a financial incentive to helping people get more fit. When new products come to market, building up a community and customer base from scratch is essential. One key challenge is finding that market and audience, although that applies to any sports tech startup bringing something innovative to the table. Additionally, the Bownce community plays a crucial role in this ecosystem. Every community member can support and inspire others to use Bownce’s IoT double punching ball for their benefits, whether for fitness, emotions, fun, or otherwise. Combining microtechnologies with emerging technologies like crypto and blockchain is difficult enough, but convincing the community that this is a product worth their time might be even more of a challenge. On top of that, there is the need to differentiate themselves from others with a unique brand appearance, preparing a good promotion strategy, and alike, which most businesses have to face. Despite the challenges, the concept of being part of a community encouraging a healthier lifestyle is appealing. Additionally, users can exchange stories and experiences with others, strengthening the ties that bind. Bownce has a unique approach to exercising and working out. The team behind the project believes that the lack of such a space is one of the biggest reasons why people give up on their healthy lifestyles. As such, there is a lack of motivation, and they can’t afford to motivate themselves due to their busy schedules. However, by connecting them to a worldwide community that shares the same goals and beliefs, presenting them with challenges, achievements, and rewards, the project hopes to change this and help people prolong their lifespan by engaging in sports activities and achieving hours of fun. Interestingly, Bownce doesn’t have any competitors, although it does have particular market companions. It was inspired by projects that proved that there is a big demand out there for sports activities in home environments. As new trends emerge in fitness and healthcare, it is crucial for companies and startups, like Bownce, to get a head start in these segments. The demand for working out at home gains more ground, and Bownce’s product fits that narrative rather well. All in all, Bownce has tremendous potential, yet gaining widespread consumer traction will remain the top priority. However, as a unique and worthwhile venture, it will certainly attract attention, which encourages its developers to keep focusing on their work and the idea of making the world healthier than ever. Furthermore, the bonus of earning crypto tokens can serve as an incentive for users to stick with their fitness activities for longer periods.",
