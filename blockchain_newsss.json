Particularly/ if you are in a country that has only a few good options to receive money from abroad. It seems obvious to us crypto folks. Send someone Bitcoin/ Ethereum or stablecoin: problem solved? Yet/ much of the non-crypto world doesn't realize or agree with the upsides of using crypto for cross-border transactions. In all fairness/ crypto does have some downsides/ too. This article compares different cross-border payment options and explains how they work: Correspondent banking (wire transfers) Fintechs Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) Bitcoin and stablecoins But first/ let's look at what international payments are and how they work.

Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox/ along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right/ millions love us!) — what are you waiting for? What Are Cross-Border Payments and How Do They Work? Cross-border payments are transactions where both parties reside in different countries and use different currencies (surprise/ surprise). They are more complex than domestic payments for several reasons: They involve different national legal and regulatory frameworks. Banks have to swap currencies. Transactions may have to be executed across time zones and operating hours. Several intermediaries and financial market infrastructures are involved. There are two types of cross-border payments: retail and wholesale payments. Retail is the type you may have used before: Paying a business abroad. Sending money to someone in another country. Buying something from another country. Wholesale payments include high-value transactions between commercial banks. These can also be batched retail transactions. Furthermore/ there are transactions with and without foreign exchange conversion. For instance/ payments in the EU can be across borders/ but the currency remains the same (euros). Why are cross-border payments so interesting? Because Oliver Wyman reports that \"Global corporates move nearly $23.5 trillion across countries annually/ equivalent to about 25% of global GDP.\" They also incur \"transaction costs of more than $120 billion per annum.\" That's a lot of money that can be saved. Those costs are incurred across different domains: Operational costs Compliance with AML regulations Foreign exchange swaps Liquidity requirements Ideally/ we'd want international payments to comply with regulations/ be fast/ efficient/ instantaneous and support many different currency pairs. Yup/ that's quite the wishlist. With that said/ let's see how different international payment options compare. Correspondent Banking Correspondent banking is the traditional way of wiring money using banks. It is also a handful to explain. In the most basic terms/ correspondent banking involves three banks. One each for the exporter and importer of the goods in different countries and two correspondent banks used as intermediaries. Why do we need those? Because they take on the operational tasks and risks of sending the money across borders and swapping it for the right currency. Here's a visual explanation: Source: https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Correspondent-banking-system-today_fig1_349897918 Say you import fridges from the EU to the US. Your bank (sender bank) debits your account but does not have access to a EUR account to pay the exporter. It has to contact a correspondent bank that can make the payment to the European exporter. The correspondent bank swaps USD to EUR at the central bank and sends it to the exporter's bank account (recipient bank). The exporter ships your fridges to the US. You pay for the imported goods and a fee for the services of the correspondent bank. Since banks process many cross-border transactions/ they use so-called nostro and vostro accounts to keep track of the money. Nostro stands for “ours” and vostro for “yours.” Money in nostro accounts is money belonging to bank A but held in an account by bank B. Money in a vostro account is money belonging to bank B but held in an account by bank A. International wire transfers use the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) network/ a global payment network that facilitates the transfer of funds between banks and other financial institutions. SWIFT works by sending payment instructions between two banks/ which are then processed by the receiving bank. In contrast to correspondent banking/ the two banks do not need to have a direct relationship. This makes it easier and faster for banks to send and receive payments internationally. Pros and Cons of Correspondent Banks for International Payments Correspondent banking is good because/ well/ we know it works. It's cumbersome and relatively expensive (up to $50 per transaction)/ but it's tried and tested. Also/ in developed countries/ most people have a bank account/ so the reach is good. There are also a ton of downsides to it: Many intermediaries slow the process down. Payment systems and settlements are not always instantaneous. Payment message formats and AML checks need to be automated to not slow the process down further. Operating hours and time zones are other sources of friction. Thus/ while being the most widespread option/ correspondent banks create friction for bigger players (delays) and smaller ones (transaction fees). And that is before considering that correspondent banking in developing countries is more complex and more expensive due to higher risks and AML regulations. Fintechs Fintech companies like Revolut/ Transferwise and WeChat (China’s super app with payments function) have been disrupting the international payments niche for a while. They stand out with lower fees but offer much faster settlement times. Where banks take days/ fintechs can send money across borders in hours or even minutes. But how? Fintechs leverage having fewer intermediate layers. They either have banking licenses and direct access to central bank money or control the subsidiary banks needed to make the payments. Either way/ a fintech company works with one balance sheet across different currencies. On the customer side/ fintechs follow a simple process. Either the account has to be credited first via a wire transfer/ or the fintech can transfer funds directly from the payer's account (with their consent). Recipients simply have to accept the incoming transfer as long as they have their bank account linked to the fintech as well. Pros and Cons of Fintechs Reliable recent data is hard to come by/ but the presence of fintechs is more palpable by the day. This isn't surprising/ given how much more convenient a Revolut or Wise transfer is compared to a money wire. Especially high-volume FX pairs like USD/EUR and other highly liquid currencies are easy to manage. The focus on payments and the systematic use of new technology has allowed these companies to take market share from established banks. Still/ fintechs aren't perfect. Less liquid currencies aren't supported. An even bigger problem is liquidity. Wholesale payments or bigger sums entail regulatory challenges/ but these companies do not always have the appropriate licenses to solve them. Still/ fintechs are growing fast for a reason. CBDCs and Interoperable Payment Systems The boogeyman of the crypto industry. Almost all countries have released one or are planning to do so in the near future. Read this article for a complete overview of CBDCs. The technical side of CBDCs is not too difficult. Depending on the design of the CBDC/ the retail customer holds either an account with a commercial bank and access to central bank money or an account at the central bank itself. Almost all CBDCs follow the former approach to retain the business and goodwill of the commercial banking sector (among other reasons). The goal of cross-border CBDC payments is to make them as fast and frictionless as possible. A payment in digital dollars to digital euros should/ in theory/ be near instantaneous if the two systems are connected. Pros and Cons of CBDCs for International Payments Though disliked by most in crypto/ CBDCs are not only bad. For one/ they would be efficient and convenient. Further/ they would allow states to onboard all their citizens to the financial sector. And yes/ they would preserve monetary sovereignty (to a degree). But/ of course/ they could come with privacy concerns and can be weaponized for political goals/ both foreign and domestic. Moreover/ CBDCs could undermine the competitiveness and credibility of the banking system. In the worst case/ they could distort credit creation and lead to citizens and businesses only accepting CBDC money because it's the safest. This would concentrate enormous power in the hands of the central bank/ with possibly unpredictable consequences. Bitcoin Bitcoin is a \"peer-to-peer electronic cash system.\" There is good reason to believe that the entire point of Bitcoin was to become a frictionless medium of exchange that disrupts existing solutions. Other coins like Ethereum or Dogecoin also fall into this category. But Bitcoin is probably the most widespread non-stablecoin used for cross-border payments Of course/ the mechanism is well-known. All the two parties need are two Bitcoin addresses/ which are free to create. Settlement is comparably fast. Transaction fees are comparably low most of the time. Once you have bitcoin/ sending it is easy. But there are downsides/ too. Pros and Cons of Bitcoin for International Payments Some problems are well-known attack vectors: BTC is too volatile/ and it can be used for illicit payments. But even those get exaggerated a fair bit. For one/ Bitcoin's volatility is currently at an all-time low: Second/ most bitcoins are acquired through centralized exchanges (CEXs)/ which nowadays all require KYC checks for meaningful sums. Although 'anonymous' bitcoin does exist on peer-to-peer exchanges/ the use of crypto for illicit purposes is minuscule. Chainalysis found that only 0.24% of all crypto transactions in 2022 were made for illicit purposes. But that hints at the real problem of using BTC at scale for international payments: it is a fairly siloed ecosystem with few entry and exit points. Without centralized exchanges/ it's difficult to get BTC. It's certainly not feasible to do meaningful business in Bitcoin. Moreover/ its long-term security model is not sustainable without increased use as a medium of exchange — so custodians are needed again. Bitcoin's advantage is that it's \"outside money\" that is difficult to seize. That also makes it a suboptimal candidate for cross-border payments. Stablecoins Stablecoins are the elephant in the room. Unlike other crypto liquidity/ stablecoin settlement volume has been growing in the bear market of 2022: Source: The Block Stablecoin settlement works just as Bitcoin. But stablecoins have quite a few legs up on BTC when it comes to cross-border payments. Pros and Cons of Stablecoins for International Payments Obviously/ stablecoins eliminate the (short-term) volatility of Bitcoin payments. That is a massive plus for any kind of payment. They are also technologically efficient and provide economies of scale — the more volume a stablecoin issuer settles/ the more trustworthy it becomes and the easier it can access further liquidity. Stablecoins provide access to dollar liquidity for those who don't have it. Consider the following thought experiment: View post on Twitter But stablecoins also have downsides/ if not for the individual user/ then in the grand scheme of things: Their economies of scale mean the stablecoin market is an oligopoly. They are not (yet) as widely accepted as fiat. Transactions can be frozen. They are not capital-efficient since they need to be fully collateralized (in theory). They undermine the sovereignty of non-dollar currencies. You can argue the latter two can be advantages since stablecoins increase the demand for treasury bills and bonds if backed by real-world assets and spread the power of the dollar/ especially to countries with a devaluing currency. Conclusion What is the best way to send international payments? Truth be told/ there probably is no one best way. Even a cumbersome and inefficient solution like correspondent banking still has its place because it can cover wholesale transfers and adhere to AML regulations. But the sector is ripe for disruption/ and digital currency transfers/ especially stablecoins/ may likely continue to gain further market share in the future.

Called the Vanguard First Index Investment Trust/ it was created to track the performance of the S&P 500 — a stock market index that consists of the 500 largest public companies in the U.S. — with a main goal: to allow retail investors to invest at a low fee. Since then/ index funds have exploded in popularity. As of March 2022/ retail investors have invested more in passive index funds than actively-managed funds/ at $8.53 trillion versus $8.34 trillion. But what about index funds for other asset classes — particularly for digital assets? Cryptocurrency index funds represent a new and exciting way for investors to gain exposure to the digital asset market and are rapidly growing in popularity among both traditional and crypto-native investors.

What Are Traditional Index Funds? Traditionally/ index funds are simplified investment vehicles that mimic a financial market index/ such as benchmark indexes like the S&P 500/ Dow Jones Industrial Average/ Nasdaq Composite/ and Russell 3000. This allows users to speculate on the price movement of a basket of assets without needing to hold each asset individually. Index funds can come in two main forms: mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Mutual funds are managed by professional fund managers and are typically bought and sold through a brokerage firm. ETFs are similar to mutual funds/ but they trade like stocks on a stock exchange. One of the main benefits of index funds is that they offer low-cost investment options compared to actively managed mutual funds. This is because index funds follow a passive investment strategy/ which requires fewer resources and therefore results in lower operating costs. As a result/ traditional index funds typically have lower expense ratios — more on this later. Investing in traditional index funds is a simple way to gain diversified exposure to a broad market or specific sector/ with the potential to achieve returns that closely track the benchmark index. The low-cost nature of these funds also makes them an attractive option for long-term investors who seek to build wealth over time. Crucially/ index funds are not designed to outperform the underlying index they track/ but to mimic its returns as closely as possible. What Are Crypto Index Funds? Cryptocurrency index funds are investment vehicles that provide exposure to a basket of cryptocurrencies/ similar to how traditional index funds provide exposure to a basket of stocks. Cryptocurrency index funds track the performance of a benchmark index/ such as a specific cryptocurrency sector (e.g. DeFi or Metaverse) or the overall market. The main difference between cryptocurrency and traditional index funds comes down to the types of assets they invest in. While traditional index funds invest in stocks/ bonds and other ‘traditional’ financial assets/ cryptocurrency index funds invest in cryptocurrencies/ such as Bitcoin/ Ethereum/ BNB and others. While traditional index funds are a well-established investment medium/ cryptocurrency index funds remain an emerging investment option. They also operate in vastly different regulatory environments/ with traditional index funds typically being subject to heavy regulatory scrutiny/ whereas cryptocurrency are regulated differently based on the jurisdictions. How Do Crypto Index Funds Work? Cryptocurrency index funds work by investing in a basket of different cryptocurrencies/ rather than individual assets. The fund is constructed to mimic the performance of a benchmark index/ such as the top 10 or 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The proportion of the assets held in the fund is usually weighted by their market capitalization and re-balanced regularly to ensure the fund composition accurately tracks the benchmark. By investing in an index fund/ investors can gain exposure to a broad range of coins and tokens in a single swoop/ rather than having to pick and choose individual assets to invest in. This helps to both diversify risk and reduce the barrier to entry. Index funds are often managed by professionals/ who will make decisions about which coins to include in the portfolio to align with the index it is tracking/ and when to re-balance the fund. These are known as actively managed funds and typically track specific sectors or indexes. They can offer greater returns but often have higher fees. Cryptocurrency index funds have a variety of fees associated with them. But the most important are the management fees/ expense ratio and performance fees. Management Fee: This is a fee charged by the fund manager for running and maintaining the fund — typically charged as a percentage of the assets in the fund. For example/ if you invested $100/000 in a fund with a 1% management fee/ the yearly management fee will be $1/000 Expense Ratio: This is the total cost of operating the fund/ expressed as a percentage of the fund's assets. It is the total of all the fees associated with running the fund — such as management fees/ administrative costs and other expenses. Performance Fees: Some funds charge an additional sum if the fund outperforms a specific benchmark. This often ranges between 10-20% of profits above the benchmark. Cryptocurrency index funds take the research and decision-making burdens off of individual investors and make it easy to speculate on a broad range of cryptocurrencies at once. Most cryptocurrency index funds only invest in digital assets that can be transacted on-chain/ such as cryptocurrencies/ utility and governance tokens/ NFTs/ and on-chain derivatives. But there are also more traditional funds that provide exposure to the price movement of cryptocurrency and blockchain company stock — such as mining companies/ exchanges/ hardware manufacturers and infrastructure providers. Cryptocurrency index funds can be described as either ‘off-chain’ or ‘on-chain’ based on the way they are accessed. Off-chain index funds are currently by far the most popular and include only index funds that are traded through an asset management firm/ whereas on-chain index funds are managed via smart contracts and the index fund tokens can typically be bought or sold on DeFi platforms. Benefits and Risks of Cryptocurrency Index Funds Cryptocurrency index funds are popular among traditional investors since they provide a simple way to gain exposure to the price action of cryptocurrencies and crypto companies without needing to understand the technicalities of acquiring and securing digital assets. Besides this/ they also have a range of other potential benefits: Low Minimum Investment: Many cryptocurrency index funds either have a low or no minimum investment requirement. This can make them attractive to those setting up a relatively small portfolio or looking to deploy small amounts of capital regularly — e.g. by dollar-cost averaging. Simplified: By eliminating the manual effort involved in securing/ storing and managing cryptocurrencies/ cryptocurrency index funds can be attractive to those that prefer a hands-off or simple investment approach. One-Shot Diversification: Cryptocurrency index funds provide price exposure to potentially dozens or even hundreds of crypto assets in a single investment vehicle. This makes diversification within crypto much simpler. Cost-Efficiency: Rather than needing to buy/ store/ and manage multiple separate crypto investments/ cryptocurrency index funds wrap this into a single investment/ making them extremely cost-efficient. That said/ they’re not without their risks. Some of the most prominent risks and drawbacks that can come with investing in a cryptocurrency index fund include: Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are typically highly volatile. This can see the value of cryptocurrency index funds fluctuate considerably over a short time period — potentially leading to sizable losses for investors. Lack of Regulation: The regulatory environment around cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Some cryptocurrency index funds may not be subject to the same level of oversight as traditional investment funds/ which can increase the risk of fraud or mismanagement. Lack of Liquidity: Some cryptocurrency index funds may have limited trading volume/ making it difficult to buy or sell shares in the fund without significant slippage. Crypto Index Funds vs Crypto Mutual Funds Cryptocurrency index funds and cryptocurrency mutual funds are both investment vehicles that allow investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency market. However/ there are some key differences between the two. While cryptocurrency index funds aim to track the performance of a specific cryptocurrency market index by investing in a basket of cryptocurrencies weighted in a manner that reflects the composition of the index/ cryptocurrency mutual funds are actively managed by a fund manager who makes active decisions about which assets to invest in. This can include deciding the portfolio composition and asset allocation/ as well as investment timing and risk management practices. Because of this/ they are considered actively managed/ whereas crypto index funds are passively managed. Popular Cryptocurrency Index Funds The cryptocurrency index fund landscape is still relatively small/ but there are a number of well-established funds that track different crypto sectors or strategies. Some of the most popular currently include: Bitwise 10 Large Cap Crypto Index Fund: This index fund includes the top 10 largest cryptocurrencies weighted by market capitalization. CoinShares Blockchain Global Equity Index: Tracks the performance of companies worldwide that have significant exposure to blockchain technology. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust: This index fund primarily includes Bitcoin/ but may also include other cryptocurrencies in the future. Galaxy Crypto Index Fund: This index fund includes a variety of cryptocurrencies/ with a focus on the top performers in the market. The DeFi Pulse Index (DPI): Tracks the most popular Ethereum-based decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and tokens. Binance CoinMarketCap Top 10 Equal-Weighted Index: This index tracks the top 10 cryptocurrencies on CMC (excluding stablecoins)/ and is equally weighted and rebalanced on a monthly basis to reflect the most recent market movement. Cryptocurrency index funds can vary considerably in the types of assets they track/ how they are rebalanced/ participation requirements/ fees and more. Because of this/ it’s important to do your due diligence and research before investing in one. Learn about index fund tokens/ here. Where to Buy Cryptocurrency Index Funds? Unlike regular cryptocurrencies/ cryptocurrency index funds are rarely available to trade on standard cryptocurrency exchanges — typically known as centralized exchanges (CEXs) or decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Instead/ they are typically traded on asset management platforms. Some of the most popular platforms for trading cryptocurrency index funds currently include: Bitwise: Offers a variety of low-cost index funds tracking top crypto market caps/ with diverse portfolios and easy investment options. ICONOMI: Platform offering index funds based on a basket of cryptos weighted by market cap/ with a user-friendly interface and low fees. Coinshares: Coinshares’ index funds track the top crypto market caps/ with low management fees and diversified portfolios. Offers physically-backed funds for added security. Bitfund: Bitfund's index funds are based on a basket of cryptocurrencies and track the performance of the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Its low management fees are one of its standout features. Fidelity: Well-established platform offering index funds tracking top crypto market caps. Known for its reputation and reliability/ it also provides custody and trading services. Uniswap: For on-chain crypto index funds like the DeFi Pulse Index/ it can be bought directly on DeFi platforms/ with DPI having the most liquidity on Uniswap. Binance: The Binance CoinMarketCap Top 10 Equal-Weighted Index can be bought directly on Binance/ and the auto-invest feature is available for users interested in DCA.

This information includes: The transaction history of a specific address The number of confirmations a transaction has The current balance of an address. Block explorers are commonly used by both beginner and experienced cryptocurrency users. For beginners/ block explorers can provide a simple way to view and track their own transactions and understand how the blockchain works. More experienced users/ on the other hand/ can use them to monitor the health of a blockchain network and analyze market trends and notable wallet addresses. As it stands/ there are dozens of different block explorers in operation/ including multiple options for the same blockchain. In addition/ there are multi-chain block explorers that track multiple different blockchains on one platform. Fortunately/ most operate in a very similar manner — once you know how to use one/ the others are usually intuitive. Here/ we dive into how you can use a block explorer to access interesting and potentially useful data about your blockchain(s) of choice. Most of the examples shown below are for BscScan.com/ but the process is usually similar for other block explorers. Subscribe Join us in showcasing the cryptocurrency revolution/ one newsletter at a time. Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox/ along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right/ millions love us!) — what are you waiting for? What Is a Blockchain Explorer? As their name suggests/ block explorers allow you to quickly examine the contents of blocks as they appear on a blockchain. These allow you to search a blockchain much in the same way as searching a simple online database and provide a simple visual representation of block contents/ transaction details/ address activity/ and more. They are powerful tools that give you access to a range of real-time and historical data about a blockchain/ including the current operating parameters — like block height/ difficulty/ congestion/ and average transaction fees/ as well as a detailed range of insights about transactions. Did you know: Many block explorers also allow you to track ‘orphan blocks’ — learn more about them here. There are currently well over 50 different block explorers in operation/ but some of the most popular currently include: Ethereum: Etherscan BNB Chain: BscScan Solana: Solana Explorer (Beta) or SolanaFM Avalanche: Avalanche Explorer TRON: TRONScan Polygon: Polygonscan Multi-chain: Blockchair Many people use block explorers to keep track of their own on-chain activity and better their understanding of how their favorite blockchains operate. But some use them to gather crucial insights and identify trends that can be used to manage risk/ improve trading profitability/ and spot opportunities early. That said/ not all block explorers are built equal. It’s important to try out several options to find the one(s) that offers the data and features you need. How Do You Use a Block Explorer? Though there are dozens of block explorers in operation/ most operate in a very similar (or even identical) manner — making it easy to hop from platform to platform. Here/ we provide a generic overview of how to make good use of a block explorer. Search an Addresses’ Balance and Activity Blockchain explorers are useful for quickly checking the balance and recent activity of specific addresses. They allow you to input an address and quickly pull up its current balance and holdings — including coins/ fungible tokens/ and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Here’s how: Step 1: Paste the address into the primary search bar and press enter. Step 2: This will load an overview of the address including its current balance/ recent transactions and details of its token holdings. Step 3: From here/ you can click the wallet icon to view a detailed overview of the address’ token holdings or scroll down to see its recent transaction history. This can be useful for keeping track of your token balances and identifying any airdrops you may have received/ while most block explorers allow you to export a .csv file for all your transactions — including the date/ transacted token and value at the time of transaction. This can be extremely useful when filling in your tax return. Besides checking the regular token balances an address has/ you can also see which (if any) non-fungible tokens (NFTs) an address is holding by simply scrolling through the ‘Token:’ drop-down menu. NFTs will usually be listed near the bottom. Unfortunately/ most block explorers will not show the artwork or other visual/audio/interactive data associated with an NFT. It’s best to use an NFT marketplace like OpenSea or Rarible for this purpose. Look up Blockchain Transactions Blocks contain a list of transactions that have been confirmed on the blockchain. Block explorers allow you to easily check the contents of a block to find out which transactions it contains as well as who mined (or validated) the block. This can help those looking to identify participants in a specific transaction/ check how much they paid for gas/ or in some cases/ check why it took too long to confirm (or failed). Looking up a specific transaction is just as simple as searching for an address. Step 1: Copy and paste the transaction hash into the primary search bar of your chosen block explorer. Step 2: Press \"Enter\" or click on the \"Search\" button. Step 3: The specific transaction information should be displayed on the page/ including the transaction hash/ the block number/ the timestamp/ the input and output address/ the amount transferred/ and the transaction fee. Step 4: You can also view the transaction on the block it was mined by clicking on the block number. This will pull up a list of the other transactions included in the same block. Step 5: Some explorers also have the option to see a visualization of the transaction which can make it easier to understand how it works. View the Contents of a Block Besides a list of transactions/ most block explorers will also provide further details on the block parameters — such as its height/ size/ difficulty/ and gas limit — should this information be of concern. They will also usually provide a full overview of the contents of each block/ including a list of the transactions it includes/ its timestamp/ child and parent blocks/ average gas fee/ and more. This can be used to see how competitive block space is/was at any given time. Here’s how to view the contents of a block: Step 1: Locate a block explorer website that supports the blockchain you wish to view. Step 2: Search for the block number or block hash that you wish to view. Step 3: The block explorer will display detailed information about the block/ including the block number/ the miner address/ the block size/ the number of transactions/ and the timestamp of the block. Step 4: It will also provide a list of the transactions the block contains. Each transaction will be represented by a transaction hash/ which you can click on to find more detailed information about it — such as the participants (input and output addresses)/ transacted amount/ transacted asset and fee paid. Step 5: You can also view other data in the block such as the difficulty level/ the block reward and the previous block hash (if available). Check the Gas Price Most smart contract blockchains see the price of gas fluctuate based on supply and demand. This can see the price of transacting on the blockchain vary considerably throughout the day. Because of this/ it can be in your best interest to double-check the price of gas before attempting to transact on your blockchain of choice. By holding off on your transaction(s) until the gas price falls/ you can often save a considerable chunk of change in fees. Fortunately/ many block explorers will clearly state the current average or median price for gas on their homepage/ and some will provide a detailed overview of the current gas market. Here’s how to find a more detailed overview of the gas market of your selected chain. Step 1: Head over to the block explorer and find the gas details section on the homepage. Step 2: Click on this to open up a detailed overview of the current gas market. Depending on the explorer/ this will usually detail how congested the network currently is/ and express the gas requirements to ensure your transactions are confirmed quickly. Check the Current Validator Set Many Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains are secured by a validator set. This is the current rotation of validators that are eligible to be selected for block production. Depending on the platform/ validators may be rotated in and out of the set based on the size of their stake/ community votes or other factors. Some block explorers will provide an overview of the current validator set/ allowing you to get an idea of the current minimum stake required to join the set/ as well as the recent activity of existing validators. Here’s how to find the current validator set on BscScan: Step 1: Navigate to the BscScan homepage and find the Validators option in the header. Step 2: Hover over \"Validators\" and select \"Validators Leaderboard\" from the drop-down menu. This will open a new page providing an overview of the current validators ranked by voting power/ and provide details about their recent activity. View Token Details Most blockchains support a variety of different token types/ and major layer-1 blockchains like Ethereum/ BNB Chain and Avalanche now each have a well-developed and growing ecosystem of native tokens. Block explorers allow you to access a wealth of information about a token by simply searching for its token contract. This can help you research a token before potentially investing in it/ or even help you determine whether the token is genuine or not (see this post for more on fake tokens). Here’s how to view details about your token/s of choice: Step 1: Find the token’s contract address for your chosen chain on its coin detail page here on CoinMarketCap. Step 2: Paste this into the search bar of your chosen block explorer. In this case/ we’ll search for the USDC contract address on BscScan. Step 3: This will pull up a range of details about the token/ including its name/ recent token transfers/ and details of the contract creator. Step 4: For more information about the token/ click the Token Tracker link. This will pull up further details about the token/ such as the current number of holders/ total supply/ and list of official social profiles. Find Trending Tokens Block explorers track all of the transactions processed by one or more blockchains. Using this data/ they can also tease out a wide range of useful insights — such as determining which tokens are growing or declining in popularity/ and identifying newly launched projects. In most cases/ it’ll arrange this information for you and make it easy to find. Here’s how to check for trending tokens: Step 1: Head over to your chosen block explorer and hover over the token section of the site using the top navigation bar. Step 2: Here/ you’ll see a list of options/ allowing you to view the top fungible tokens or non-fungible tokens on your blockchain of choice. Step 3: On the subsequent page/ you’ll be provided a range of details about these trending tokens/ allowing you to perform further research and due diligence. Analyze Charts and Stats Block explorers aggregate a huge amount of data about the operations of compatible blockchains and render this information easily accessible through a simple search and explorer system. That said/ for those unaccustomed to wading through data/ they can seem congested and difficult to get to grips with. Several block explorers help to tackle this challenge and improve their usability by providing a range of ready-made charts and statistics. These can help users better visualize the way blockchains operate and get an understanding of some of the key insights and trends this data contains. Here’s how to view charts and stats for your chosen blockchain; Step 1: Head over to your chosen block explorer and search the heading bar. This will usually contain an option such as \"resources\"/ \"analytics\"/ or \"charts.\" Step 2: Select the charts or statistics option as required. This will then pull up a further list of options/ allowing you to refine the types of charts/data you are provided. Step 3: From here/ select the chart or data you wish to access. Bear in mind that the information generally refreshes once per day. Charts cover various metrics such as daily transactions/ unique addresses/ active addresses and more/ which can help tell user adoption/ activity on the blockchain and more. With that/ here are the steps needed to start using a blockchain explorer. Happy exploring!

Despite this/ many of us still don’t understand the difference between Web3 and cryptocurrencies in general/ and it gets more confusing when it appears like every crypto project has seemingly pivoted to a Web3 rebranding overnight. One thing is for sure: Many consider web3 to be the “killer app” that can make crypto truly mainstream thanks to a plethora of high-potential use cases. In this article/ we’ll dive into the following: Explain what Web3 cryptos are Look at some of the most popular coins out there Dissect the compelling use cases they offer Please note that none of the information in this article should be construed as financial advice of any kind/ and are purely for educational purposes only. First/ let’s start with the basics. Subscribe Join us in showcasing the cryptocurrency revolution/ one newsletter at a time. Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox/ along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right/ millions love us!) — what are you waiting for? What Is Web3? While there is a lot of confusion surrounding the term/ Web3 is typically considered to be distinct from Web 3.0 — which is the next-generation of the world wide web/ also known as the semantic web where users can “read-write-own.” Instead/ the Web3 term is used to represent the next generation of the internet — which is being created to free internet users from the need to use Web 2 firms (centralized intermediaries (who have gained a bad reputation for exploiting users’ rights to privacy and freedom of speech for financial gain) by replacing them with decentralized service providers instead. This is similar to how Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have removed the need for people to use banks and other financial institutions when transferring or storing value. Read: Web2 vs Web3 Web3’s decentralized structure allows to ensure real data privacy and censorship resistance and enables users to control and monetize their private data as they wish/ instead of lining the pockets of Big Tech through targeted advertising. As with regular public blockchains/ network participants are incentivized with Web3 cryptos to share their resources in order to help provide and maintain specific network infrastructure and services. What Are Web3 Cryptos? Web3 cryptos are a new generation of cryptocurrencies that incentivize the building of a new decentralized internet. These native tokens of Web3 projects are distributed as incentives to network participants (such as users/ validators/ service providers/ content creators etc.) for their support. Web3 cryptocurrencies combine smart contract and blockchain technology/ and promises artists and the creator economy a much fairer sharing of revenue/ such as royalties and commission/ since Web2 firms like Meta/ Spotify and YouTube no longer receive the lion’s share for providing a centralized platform. Is Web3 a Cryptocurrency? No/ Web3 itself is not a specific blockchain or cryptocurrency in itself/ but rather a decentralized version of the Internet that uses cryptocurrencies to provide specific services to users. However/ Web3 and cryptocurrencies both run on borderless public blockchains and share important similarities such as enabling decentralization/ trustlessness/ open-source technology and equal access for all users. What Do Web3 Cryptos Do? Web3 crypto coins and tokens are used to incentivize a decentralized range of services previously provided by centralized tech companies. These critical services include data storage (e.g. Filecoin and Arweave)/ network infrastructure (Helium for example)/ bandwidth and processing power sharing (e.g. Theta and Render)/ data indexing (see The Graph) identification/ web hosting/ social media and more. What Are the Biggest Web3 Projects Right Now? Web3 projects provide a full gamut of decentralized web services/ and the top Web3 cryptos will be familiar to crypto users. The five most popular Web3 cryptos by market cap are Polkadot/ Chainlink/ Filecoin/ Internet Computer and Theta Network. All are well-established and have been around for more than a few years. With only DOT/ LINK/ FIL and ICP currently managing a market cap over $1 billion/ this nascent crypto sector still offers a lot of growth potential if Web3 can deliver on its promise. That remains a big “if” at present though/ so DYOR before investing anything. Make sure you first understand concepts like tokenomics/ total market cap/ and fully diluted value in full. What Are the Best Web3 Cryptos in 2023? There are hundreds of Web3 projects currently building throughout the crypto winter since 2022/ although falling token prices/ bankruptcies and fall of major players like FTX/ who invested heavily in the Web3 space/ may end up killing these projects. Therefore/ it’s best to play it safe during a bear market and only consider Web3 cryptos that already have measurable network effect/ utility and continuing traction. You can find the list of the top Web3 tokens and smaller/ riskier projects all here on CoinMarketCap’s list of top Web3 tokens by market cap. Before investing/ consider these 5five things to know first and strategies such as dollar cost averaging (DCA). Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink (LINK) is a oracle network that connects crypto networks with real-world data/ thereby making it one of the most highly touted crypto projects out there. LINK uses smart contracts to connect to various off-chain data sources such as data feeds/ events/ APIs/ banking payment networks and more. Further/ many decentralized protocols utilize Chainlink’s price and market data feeds on their platform. While its price doesn’t reflect this/ Chainlink is finally starting to kick things up a notch/ and recently introduced LINK staking/ which will make it appealing as an investment that generates passive income. Filecoin (FIL) Filecoin (FIL) uses blockchain technology to enable the decentralized storage of almost all types of data (audio/video/images etc)/ similar to centralized platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS). Filecoin incentivizes participants who contribute hardware sharing with its FIL coin. It launched with a $200M ICO/ and many believe it is set to play an important role in the future of Web3/ where decentralized storage will be a critically important component. Helium (HNT) Helium (HNT)/ also referred to as the “People’s Network/” is a blockchain-powered decentralized and wireless P2P network that connects thousands of Internet of Things (IoT) hotspot devices around the world in order to share data through radio wave technology/ free from intermediaries that could censor/ block or misappropriate this information. It uses its own Proof-of-Coverage consensus algorithm to validate and reward participating hotspots with its HNT token as incentive. Audius (AUDIO) Audius (AUDIO) is a decentralized music streaming platform that aims to become the blockchain’s version of Spotify/ only with better royalty-sharing for artists and attractive rewards for listeners and network node operators in the form of its native asset the AUDIO token. Audius is backed by some of the top names in the music industry/ including Steve Aoki/ 3LAU/ Katy Perry and more. Theta (THETA) Theta Network (THETA) is a powerful blockchain-based platform that delivers decentralized video streaming for both Web3 firms and traditional media streaming firms/ who are struggling to keep up with their users’ insatiable need for higher resolution and bigger bandwidth. Theta already boasts validator nodes from Big Tech firms like Google/ Samsung and Sony/ and continues to make traction thanks to its ability to be customized and scaled as needed by clients. Users share bandwidth/ storage and processing power in order to earn THETA rewards. A project similar to Theta is Livepeer (video streaming) and Render Network (RNDR)/ which instead of video streaming focuses on building a decentralized network of shared graphics processing (GPU) power in order to render 3D graphics used in gaming and other applications. Polkadot (DOT) It’s no surprise that Polkadot (DOT) tops the list of biggest Web3 cryptos by market cap/ as its founder Gavin Wood actually coined the term “Web3” in 2014/ and later launched the Web3 Foundation/ which provides funding for builders. Polkadot (and its “canary network” Kusama/ which is used for early testing) is Wood’s realization of that vision for a decentralized web/ an interoperable multi-chain platform that can seamlessly connect compatible public and private chains (called parachains) through its Relay Chain to securely interact with each other in a trustless/ immutable and transparent manner. DOT/ its native asset/ helps incentivize services for operations/ security/ network governance and bonding tokens for use between parachains. Internet Computer (ICP) Internet Computer (ICP)/ controversially developed by Dfinity/ is building an ambitious “World Computer” blockchain that can power a complete range of end-to-end fully decentralized web services. Internet Computer allows project builders to avoid the security and privacy pitfalls that come with using traditional IT cloud computing/ database and web server providers/ and differentiates itself by using smart contract software (called “canisters”) and innovative blockchain applications such as chain key cryptography. Canisters can scale at speeds comparable to Web2 services/ and allows users to use the web and other blockchains without the need for bridges. The Graph (GRT) The Graph (GRT) is an indexing protocol that enables data-heavy networks like Ethereum and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to query data in order to support DeFi and Web3 protocols. The Graph makes it easy thanks to a hosted service for any developer to create and publish a subgraph/ an open-source application programming interface (API) that apps can query to retrieve blockchain data by using GraphQL. Read: What Is IPFS? The Graph makes it easier for developers to pull specific data from blockchains/ where they previously had to create centralized servers and databases for indexing and querying/ which was expensive/ time-consuming and less secure due to a single point of failure. Apps that use The Graph only need to provide an API endpoint such as the Uniswap subgraph to start querying data/ for example trade volumes. Stacks (STX) Bitcoin maxis rejoice: Thanks to Stacks (STX) and similar projects/ smart contract and decentralized application (DApp) next-generation use cases are finally coming to Bitcoin (BTC)/ without altering its core value proposition of the most decentralized security and stability that crypto has to offer. Stacks is a layer-1 blockchain building on top of Bitcoin. Its DApps are modular and open/ built on top of each other and leverage Bitcoin as a secure base layer for all settlements and network activity. Its proof-of-transfer consensus mechanism drives Bitcoin adoption as miners need to pay in BTC to mint new STX tokens/ and conversely “stack” these tokens to earn BTC in return. Previously known as Blockstack/ Stacks’ native asset STX and smart contract-focused programming language Clarity (also used by Algorand) is used to execute smart contracts/ validate transactions and add new assets on its blockchain. Importantly/ Stacks was the first SEC-qualified cryptocurrency for sale in the U.S./ helping it raise nearly $30 million in 2019. With so much confusion around what the SEC considers to be crypto securities/ it’s very bullish for Stacks that STX is not viewed as one by the State’s leading securities regulator. Kadena (KDA) Kadena (KDA) is a proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain that aims to scale Bitcoin by combining its PoW consensus mechanism with directed acyclic graph (DAG) elements. Just like Stacks/ Kadena aims to leverage Bitcoin’s security for use by businesses/ in this case by achieving high throughput (how many actions can be completed within a certain time) comparable to traditional IT service providers. It can mint several blocks at the same time/ by connecting several blockchains that work together at the same time and asynchronously to verify network transactions. This also boosts the chain’s security as bad actors have less time between blockchain confirmations to attack the network. Kadena offers multi-chain support/ decentralized infrastructure and the ability to scale at an industrial level while remaining energy-efficient compared to Bitcoin. Importantly/ Kadena offers enterprises the ability to cover their customers’ gas fees through the use of their gas stations/ a major hurdle for crypto application in mainstream businesses. Kadena’s permissioned layer-2 blockchain Kuro can support up to 8/000 transactions per second across its 500 nodes.

DOGE was just the first wave though/ and many more pixelated moonshots have come and gone since. At their core/ memecoins allow us to celebrate the raging power of community/ encouraging us to dream big and believe that any underdog can make a comeback and get that knockout. And this year's Meme Coin of the Year winner/ BONK/ fully embodies that community-driven ethos. After launching as an airdrop in December 2021/ the power of grassroots momentum kicked Bonk into high gear. Now boasting over 450/000 holders/ compatibility across 9 chains/ integration with 100+ Web3 projects/ and over 4/000% gains since inception - Bonk has bonked its way to the top. While some dismiss meme coins as superficial hype machines/ we at CMC celebrate the way they drive awareness/ adoption/ and access for retail investors. And BONK has shown tremendous success in rallying a dedicated community behind its lighthearted ambition to be the #1 community coin in Web3. Note: The Meme Coin Of The Year Award is presented in partnership with Trust Wallet - the world's leading trusted & secure crypto wallet & Web3 gateway/ with 80 million+ users. In today's deep dive/ we'll explore the origins and meteoric rise that pushed Bonk into the limelight to be our Meme Coin of the Year... Coinbase and Binance Listing The leading Solana-based memecoin/ BONK/ went on an astonishing run recently/ surging over 29/000% since the start of October. While the Solana ecosystem has been heating up in recent months/ the leading memecoin of Solana surged ahead after Coinbase/ the largest U.S. based exchange/ announced that they will list BONK with the \"experimental label\" on December 14. View post on Twitter Just a day later/ on Dec. 15/ leading crypto exchange Binance announced that they will list Bonk with the \"Seed Tag\" and open up trading for BONK on Dec. 16 at 8am UTC. View post on Twitter With two major exchange listings/ the dog-themed memecoin surged even further/ surpassing Floki and establishing itself as the third-largest \"dog-themed\" memecoin by market capitalization. Source: https://coinmarketcap.com/view/doggone-doggerel/ But what exactly is the memecoin BONK/ whose impressive rally has led to people buying the once-struggling Solana Saga phone just for a BONK airdrop? What Is Bonk (BONK)? Bonk (BONK) is a meme coin that calls itself “the first Solana dog coin for the people by the people.” Bonk — or the “people’s dog coin” of Solana — was distributed via an airdrop. According to Bonk’s one-pager/ its contributors were “tired of toxic “Alameda” tokenomics. This presumably refers to the collapse of FTX and its sister company Alameda Research/ both headed by Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF). Bonk aims to be a “fun meme coin where everyone gets a fair shot.” Bonk follows in the footsteps of other famous dog-themed meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin/ albeit one that launched during a bear market. At the start of 2023/ BONK experienced an impressive rally of over 2/000%/ although prices have fallen by over 66% since highs reached on Jan. 5. This has resulted in the team burning 5 trillion $BONK tokens/ worth almost $1 million at the time/ to reduce tokens in circulation and backstop the price decline. The current supply is 94.1 trillion $BONK/ and the token has over 117K holders/ according to Solscan. Like many other meme coins/ the founders of Bonk remain anonymous. Dog coins and other meme coins have developed a reputation for being rug pulls. Therefore/ investors in Bonk are advised to proceed with the utmost caution. However/ it is worth noting that some meme coins/ like the aforementioned SHIB and DOGE/ have been trading regularly for years. The same is true for FLOKI/ another dog-themed coin. Being founded by anonymous developers does not automatically mean a coin will be a rug pull or a pump-and-dump. Bonk Airdrop and Features Bonk follows the tried-and-tested formula of launching a hyped meme coin on the back of a strong community pledge. Its “Bonkpaper” explains that Bonk strives to be “the true community coin of Solana.” Many other meme coins have launched with similar-sounding promises. Bonk aims to distinguish itself by not being “in the hands of VCs/” an accusation the Solana ecosystem has often faced. Bonk aims to achieve that by airdropping a large portion of its tokens to “NFT degens and DeFi traders” in the Solana ecosystem. The “Bonk vision” will be propelled by a team of early contributors/ “dedicated to the long-term success” of Bonk. All of this is to make 2023 a better year for the Solana community than 2022/ according to Bonk. The Bonkpaper outlines how 2022 was a “brutal year” for the Solana community/ which fell victim to “predatory actors.” In 2023/ Bonk wants to lead the charge in taking the network control back to the hands of users. For that reason/ it has “many planned integrations/” a seemingly standard promise of many meme coins. It aims to “provide superior distribution mechanics” compared to other meme coins thanks to its airdrop distribution tactic. Bonk (BONK) Coins Tokenomics BONK is distributed in the following manner: 20% goes to 40 active Solana NFT projects/ representing 296/000 NFTs. 15 goes to openbook traders. Bonk will not announce thresholds to “prevent gaming of the system” but promises even small balances can qualify. 10% goes to artists and collectors of 1/1 art that provide a snapshot of activity from collector.sh. 5% goes to Solana developers. 20% goes to early contributors helping with the launch. 22 individuals are included in this/ with a vesting period of 36 months of linear vesting. 5% goes to future contribution and development incentives. 15% goes to a Bonk DAO. 5% goes to an initial liquidity distribution on different decentralized exchanges. 5% goes to marketing purposes. How Is the Bonk Network Secured? Bonk is an SPL token on Solana. The project website does not provide any information regarding a security audit. Solana is one of the most commonly used blockchains/ secured by a proof-of-stake-type consensus mechanism that allows it to achieve some of the highest transaction speeds among all chains.

And we’re not just talking about the downward price action. This year has seen some of our biggest industry “champions” fall from grace as their empires collapse like a house of cards/ costing investors tens of billions in lost or stolen funds. This has resulted in a large number of users moving funds off exchanges in order to protect their assets/ despite exchanges scrambling to come up with new transparency features such as Proof-of-Reserve (learn about CoinMarketCap’s new tracker here). So with crypto’s annus horribilis nearly at end/ the big question for 2023 is (yet again): Where and how do I store my crypto safely? The answer remains: Self-custody/ where only you safekeep and control your crypto assets. If you’re new to crypto or need a refresher on how and where to self-custody your crypto in a private wallet (also known as an unhosted or non-custodial wallet) and protect it from all those cold cold hearts in crypto/ preferably in cold storage/ this article is for you. First/ let’s review the crypto’s recent custodial carnage that brought us to this point. Subscribe Join us in showcasing the cryptocurrency revolution/ one newsletter at a time. Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox/ along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right/ millions love us!) — what are you waiting for? Crypto Custodians Fall Like Dominoes The shocking demise of SEC darling Sam Bankman Fried’s exchange FTX and trading firm Alameda Research over a few days in November 2022 has cost the industry billions of dollars in lost funds/ resurrecting its former image as a Wild West of unregulated finance from the Mt. Gox days/ and exposed an insidious underlayer of alleged mismanagement and criminality that shocked even Enron veterans. It has put another huge dirty nail in the coffin of centralized crypto custodians who are now seemingly teetering like a house of cards instead of providing the stability and yield they/ as trusted financial intermediaries/ promised during better times (yes/ only last year). It can be argued that FTX and other CeFi firms like Celsius/ 3 Arrows Capital/ BlockFi/ Voyager/ Genesis and others have all been wiped out by the domino effect that Luna Terra’s collapse earlier this year set off. As its contagion spread across the industry/ interconnected custodial lenders and borrowers who were secretly using high-risk leverage with customer funds to offer high yield to investors were eventually exposed and claimed by the fallout. With the confidence in these crypto custodians and exchanges at all time lows/ it seems we’ve gone full circle and need to return to crypto’s core value: self-custody. Proof-of-Keys vs Proof-of-Reserves On Jan. 3/ 2019/ a new movement started on the 10th anniversary of Bitcoin’s genesis block in the midst of the last brutal crypto winter. Called “Proof-of-Keys/” it implored all exchange users to temporarily take their crypto off them to see if these entities actually held all the user digital assets they claimed to. While the idea is laudable/ it's supposed to be more rhetorical than practical/ highlighting the most important truth in all of crypto: Not Your Keys/ Not Your Crypto. Let’s repeat that one more time. Not Your Keys/ Not Your Crypto. Meanwhile/ post-FTX crypto exchanges/ led by industry leader Binance/ have created their version of Proof-of-Keys to provide better transparency and peace of mind for users. Called Proof-of-Reserve/ this is the self-disclosing of user deposit holdings and proves that an exchange is as liquid as they say. However/ it doesn’t necessarily reflect any liabilities that the exchange or custodian might be holding. CoinMarketCap introduced a new Proof-of-Reserve tracker on our site in November to help users check on centralized crypto exchanges’ reserves. The truth is that crypto like Bitcoin was created to remove the need for financial intermediaries/ thanks to its trustless/ immutable and decentralized nature. However/ as the crypto industry grew/ centralized exchanges and custodians came to market to service users' needs/ providing ease of access to cryptocurrency. Unfortunately/ the outsized influence of these centralized entities allowed it to get away with many things — from misusing users funds to outright fraud. Evidently/ proof-of-keys is as important as ever. Self-Custody Basics OK/ back to self-custody. Firstly/ in order to move your funds off exchanges and self-custody your crypto/ you’re going to need a non-custodial wallet which only you control. There are two broad categories to understand: 1. Cold Wallets (offline): hardware wallets/ paper and steel wallets 2. Hot Wallets (online): software and browser-based wallets In recent years/ hot wallets and cold wallets have gravitated to become more like the other. Hot wallets/ considered more insecure as they’re connected to the Internet/ have become more secure thanks to new biometric measures such as fingerprint and retina sign-ins on the devices they’re kept on/ such as phones and computers. Meanwhile cold storage wallets/ known as hardware wallets/ have upped their game considerably/ giving users safe access to DeFi/ NFTs and Web3 applications. What Is a Cold Wallet? Cold wallets are offline crypto wallets that are never connected to the Internet and therefore cannot be remotely accessed by third parties online. These physical wallets keep your crypto in what is called cold storage and are considered the most secure wallets out there. There are three main types: a paper wallet/ steel wallet and hardware wallet. A paper wallet is simply a paper printout or written recording of your private key or recovery seed phrase on a piece of paper. A steel wallet is a virtually indestructible metal wallet that is resistant against environmental damage like fire or water. A hardware wallet is a dedicated device that keeps your private key safe and signs transactions on your behalf with it. While paper wallets are free/ steel wallets and hardware wallets can cost anything from $50 to $400/ based on their features. Unfortunately/ paper wallets and steel wallets do not offer any further functionality other than protecting your private keys or seed phrase/ and this makes them unsuitable to partake in the wonderful new worlds of decentralized finance (DeFi)/ GameFi/ non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and Web3/ to name a few. For that/ you’re going to need a hardware wallet (or a hot wallet). One more thing: paper and steel wallets usually require the private key or recovery seed to be generated on an electronic device first. This could potentially leave a digital copy behind that can be found and exploited by hackers or other device users. The best hardware wallets allow users to create their wallets on the device itself/ without connecting to a phone or computer. What Should I Know About Hardware Wallets? Hardware wallets/ interchangeably called cold wallets/ are sophisticated electronic devices that keep your private key off the internet at all times. However/ they can differ wildly in quality and price. To pick one that is right for you/ it’s best which of the following features you value most: 1. Security 2. Form factor 3. Convenience 4. Coin support 5. Functionality Security Most hardware wallets offer various biometric and air-gapped features to enable cold storage. However/ the top ones also use a special microprocessor chip called a secure element (SE) to protect them against unauthorized private key access or device tampering. You’ll usually see an SE boast a security rating that ranges from EAL5+ to EAL7+. EAL (or CC EAL) stands for Common Criteria Evaluation Assurance Levels and helps to validate that a certain system or device (like a flagship smartphone/ hardware wallet or e-passport) meets a defined and standardized set of security requirements. A higher EAL usually brings a higher price tag/ but doesn’t necessarily mean a device is always more secure/ just that it was more stringently evaluated/ and may have provided its security features more reliably. The process can be very subjective. Therefore/ anything from 5+ should be more than adequate. NGrave/ which recently partnered with Binance Labs/ boasts an EAL7+ SE/ but also comes with a hefty price and limited coin support. Still/ it is touted to be as cold as you can get. Meanwhile/ market leader Ledger’s Nano X and S models respectively have EAL6+ and EAL5+ secure elements/ which is the same as mobile hardware wallet CoolWallet’s Pro and S models. SafePal S1 sports a 5+ SE/ while cold storage pioneer Trezor surprisingly doesn’t have secure elements in its wallets/ preferring to use a single open-source chip base instead that it has perfected over time. In a dispute between Trezor and Ledger a few years back/ the Trezor CEO quoted the “$5 wrench attack”/ which implies that your cold storage security is only as good as how well you protect it and yourself. If you were to be threatened with physical violence for example/ you may disclose its location and provide access to it/ making the secure element irrelevant. Air-gapped wallets/such as NGrave/ Ellipal Titan and Keystone/ also appeal to crypto holders who want their wallets completely isolated from all external communication/ such as even a USB cable. Form/ Factor and Convenience Most cold wallets (such as Ledger and Trezor) use a tethered USB interface to connect with a personal computer/ making them quite bulky in the process. Hardware wallets that are standalone (e.g. SafePal) or solely connect over encrypted Bluetooth to a mobile phone are usually slimmer and easier to carry around without drawing attention. The slimmer the device/ the less opportunities there are for supply-chain tampering before it gets to you. Also consider if you want to safekeep the device at home or take it with you wherever you go. In this case/ you may want to look at other factors like environmental durability and warranty. The bank card-sized and waterproof CoolWallet Pro and other similar mobile-only wallets like KeyCard are marketed as an on-the-go hardware wallet to keep close and use without drawing attention. Functionality and Coin Support Hardware wallets have historically supported much fewer coins than software wallets/ since they require more integration and security tests to maintain their overall integrity. However/ this is not the case anymore/ and many now offer full support for most leading layer-1 and layer-2 chains and their ecosystem tokens. Furthermore/ their accompanying computer or phone apps (such as Ledger Live) allow users access to a full range of DeFi and NFT integrations such as WalletConnect/ MetaMask/ Uniswap and OpenSea where they can buy/ trade and store assets as they wish. This is especially important in light of 2022’s repeated phishing campaigns targeting users of these platforms/ most notably OpenSea. Hot Wallets: What to Know A hot wallet is a crypto wallet application that is connected to the internet. This makes it conveniently quick and easy to move funds around or interact with decentralized exchanges and applications (DApps). However this online access exposes your crypto to increased risks of hacking and scamming/ as your wallet security relies heavily on the security of the device (e.g. phone or computer) it is hosted on. Your funds can also be compromised and redirected if you’re not careful/ for example if you click on a phishing link or sign the wrong smart contract/ as we saw with the OpenSea blind signing scandal earlier this year. This is something that hardware wallets protect against as the bad actor requires physical access to the device to execute a transaction. Hot wallets can be divided into: 1. Software wallets: software application that is installed and run on a phone or computer 2. Browser-based wallets: a browser extension that runs within a web browser. Hot wallets are the most popular form of self-custody wallets/ as they are free to download and easy to use once set up. With the advent of Web3/ many have now pivoted in order to be positioned as Web3 wallets. What Is a Web3 Wallet? Web3 wallets are decentralized/ feature-rich crypto wallets that are easy to use/ support multiple chains in most cases/ can store and trade users’ cryptocurrency and NFT assets/ and interact seamlessly with DApps and compatible websites. These wallets do not keep a user’s private keys or recovery seeds/ so you’ll need to store it yourself. Also/ your Web3 hot wallet security is only as good as the security of the device you host it on/ although you can also set up passwords and biometric logins for the wallet itself in most cases to add additional safety layers. Some of the most popular wallets currently are: MetaMask (for Ethereum and EVM-compatible chain assets) TrustWallet (Binance-backed multi-chain wallet)/ Phantom (Solana)/ Exodus (multi-chain support) MetaMask is the most used crypto wallet in the world thanks to its incredible versatility and ease of use that provides smooth access to hundreds of thousands of EVM-based DeFi and NFT applications and assets/ but drew a lot of flak in November 2022 when Consensys/ its creator/ disclosed that its API tool Infura were collecting users’ wallet and IP addresses. What Are Multi-Sig And MPC Wallets? Other exciting technologies are multi-party computation (MPC) and multi-signature (multi-sig) wallets which replace the need to be solely responsible for safekeeping your recovery seed or private key. MPC and multi-sig wallets are mostly used by institutional firms who require for security purposes that more than one person be involved in order to access funds. In short/ multisig wallets require a number of people to sign a transaction in order to approve it. This ensures that hackers or a bad actor or two within a firm cannot steal funds. MPC wallets like ZenGo work similarly in a way/ dividing its private key and control between a few different devices or cloud servers that store equivalent mathematical “secrets.” Only when they are joined together can funds be accessed. MPC wallets can also create single-use and time-limited dynamic keys and use enhanced security measures and encryption like ECDSA/ and threshold and Schnorr signatures. For the purposes of this article though/ we’re going to assume you are riding solo with your crypto self-custody. Here are 11 tips to stay safe. 11 Self-Custody Tips 1. Only download a wallet application from the official app store or website in order to avoid fake or modified phishing versions. 2. Ensure your wallet devices are always updated to the latest official firmware or software available. 3. Always keep your recovery seed phrase or private key safe from third parties and environmental hazards such as fire and water. 4. Never generate or store a digital copy of your recovery seed or private key. Even your printer could keep a digital copy. Write it down instead. 5. Use 2 factor-authentication (2FA) and biometric verification (fingerprints/ patterns etc) on your phone or laptop if you have a software wallet or use a hardware wallet application. 6. Be careful which smart contracts or Dapps you interact with/ and avoid blind signing where possible. 7. Research the safety of any browser extensions before you install them. 8. Spread your portfolio out over a few different hardware and software wallets to ensure your crypto eggs aren’t all in one basket. 9. Get two or more hardware wallets if you can. Keep one at home to safeguard your long term holdings/ and use a mobile hardware wallet to use DeFi and Web3 applications on a frequent basis. 10. Use different wallets and email addresses when you take part in airdrops/ and keep only the minimum funds there. 11. Use a VPN where possible to protect your anonymity against hackers and scammers. Do We Need Centralized Exchanges At All? Not all centralized crypto exchanges (CEXs) are bad apples/ and established ones like Binance/ Coinbase and Kraken have done much over the years to advance and self-regulate the industry/ diligently protecting their customers. CEXs will continue to be a major primary onramp to attract new users/ the lifeblood of crypto/ to the space/ offering great sign-up incentives/ convenient log-ins that require no private key or seed phrase/ and easy tools to convert your fiat into crypto and vice versa. After the lessons learned (the hard way) in 2022/ many have touted that instead of shunning centralized exchanges/ it can be used as an on-ramp from fiat/ quickly trading from crypto to crypto/ and then transferring and holding the bulk of your crypto assets on cold storage for the long term. The Proof-of-Reserves initiative/ where exchanges voluntarily and transparently disclose their holdings to third parties for auditing and verification/ is an important step in the right direction for exchanges. As new anti-money laundering (AML) measures such as the FATF Travel Rule/ which requires exchanges to share user information with each other for all transactions over $1/000/ become globally implemented/ this will also help to better regulate the space/ deterring bad actors from entering. So in short/ yes/ centralized exchanges will continue to have a place in crypto if they can manage to clean their house. When they behave like FTX though/ they set the entire industry back years. If you’re going to use a centralized exchange/ take a close look at their track record and user reviews. Final Thoughts This article shows a wide variety of options at your disposal to self-custody your crypto. However/ self-custody comes with its own risks/ such as losing or exposing your keys/ getting hacked/ scammed or worse case/ physically attacked. For example/ what happens if you lose access to your private key or recovery seed? It’s pretty much bye bye crypto/ as these poor souls who lost millions have found out. To try and guess a private key or recovery seed is practically impossible. Even if a brute force attack of a billion computers tried a billion keys a second for a billion years/ they’d still have less than a 1-in-a-billion chance to crack your private key. Self-custody requires commitment/ dedication and full responsibility for your crypto assets. Good luck on your new journey!

The back-to-back challenges placed UK under great strain and forced the government to enact more than a few controversial policies to get it back on track. But despite a turbulent last quarter/ the UK appears to be moving in the right direction. And with new leadership and a change in strategy/ it could be on track to separate itself from other G20 countries. In terms of crypto adoption/ 6.2% of Brits own cryptocurrency/ according to an estimate by TripleA. Meanwhile/ Chainalysis’s 2022 Global Crypto Adoption Index places the United Kingdom at 17th/ and is only one of two high income countries in the top 20 — the other being the United States. The country is now set to embark on a major push to not only restore its economy but also reinvent itself as a global crypto hub — potentially multiplying its crypto tax revenue and importing a host of new talent to boot.

The Collapse of the Pound Sterling Source: marketwatch.com The GBP has been on a negative trend against the USD/ losing over 40% of its value since 2007 — after it hit a record high of 2.06 GBP/USD. This downtrend accelerated dramatically between June 2021 and September 2022 — during which the pound lost more than 26% of its value against the dollar in 15 months. Owed to the bungled execution of Brexit/ sustained political turmoil/ hiking interest rates/ energy crunch/ and the poorly received (and now largely scrapped) “mini-budget”/ the pound has seen its purchasing power and relative value tank. Like most fiat currencies/ the British pound sterling (GBP) has been crushed by the US dollar (USD) in recent months. Indeed/ the USD has gained 12.98% against the GBP over the last year/ which places it among the top four of G10 currencies against the USD. For comparison/ the USD gained just 2.15% and 4.51% against the Swiss franc (CHF) and Canadian dollar (CAD) respectively in this time. The recent collapse of the sterling also led to a spike in GBP to BTC trading volume/ sending it to a 1-year high in September 2022. As per data published by Kaiko/ BTC/GBP trading volume spiked as traders looked to profit from the volatility of the GBP or escape inflation. England Welcomes New Prime Minister On October 20/ 2022/ former British prime minister Liz Truss resigned from her post after just six weeks in office — becoming the shortest-serving prime minister in UK history by a wide margin. This came following weeks of controversy and political turmoil surrounding her now failed mini budget. Just days later/ Rishi Sunak was welcomed into office as the fifth PM in the last six years (and the third this year). This was largely seen as a boon for the UK economy/ given Sunak's independent success as a businessman and long storied history as a member of parliament. Immediately following his appointment as UK’s new PM/ the pound sterling began to reclaim some of the losses it incurred while Liz Truss held the post. With a new plan to rescue households/ bolster the economy/ guarantee wages/ combat inflation/ and inject new capital into the economy/ Sunak is now charged with ensuring its revival. As a vocal advocate of blockchain and crypto/ Rishi Sunak is seen as a crypto-friendly PM. During his post as Chancellor of the Exchequer/ Sunak said: View post on Twitter “It’s my ambition to make the UK a global hub for cryptoasset technology/ and the measures we’ve outlined today will help to ensure firms can invest/ innovate and scale up in this country.” Sunak is now likely to introduce a financial market infrastructure sandbox/ which will allow firms to explore the use of blockchain technology and push innovation in the sector. Last year/ Sunak also proposed a UK central bank digital currency (CBDC) known as Britcoin. 2025 was set as the putative launch date for the CBDC/ but as of yet/ the UK central bank has not made the decision to introduce a digital currency. Learn more about CBDCs and their potential role in society here. Tax Changes and Turbulence In September 2022/ the UK's Chancellor of the Exchequer/ Kwasi Kwartend delivered the not-so-mini \"mini-budget\" — which was designed to tackle the cost of living crisis and boost the economy by cutting taxes/ scrapping several planned levies and tax hikes/ freezing energy bills/ and introducing several new investment zones around the UK. Just weeks later/ almost all of the tax cuts put forward in the mini-budget were scrapped following a dramatic government U-turn. This caused significant political unrest/ while news emerged that the government may reduce the income tax thresholds — helping it raise more money to restore the economy. The UK now has the third highest inflation rate in Europe at a 40-year high of 10.1% as of September 2022 — just behind Belgium's 11.27% and the Netherlands' 14.5%. To put this into perspective/ the average for the euro area (Eurozone) sits at 9.9%. The UK’s Crypto Future Right now/ the UK does not exactly stand out as a crypto haven. Crypto gains are taxed at the 20% capital gains tax rate and businesses do not benefit from a particularly favorable crypto regulatory framework — since this is largely aligned with the EU’s fifth and sixth anti-money laundering (AML) directives. But with a new PM now in office/ the UK might soon get the boost it needs to separate itself as a global crypto hub. Is your country considered one of the most crypto friendly? Find out here. According to a comprehensive roadmap laid out back in April/ the UK has a multi-step plan to help position itself as a global crypto hub. Some of the measures set out in the plan include: 1. Creating regulations that make stablecoins a recognized form of payment. 2. Introducing a Cryptoasset Engagement Group to work closely with the industry and tackle issues facing the cryptoasset sector. 3. Potentially improving the competitiveness of the UK tax system to help foster growth. 4. Working with the Royal Mint to produce an NFT for Digital Britain (currently in development). Further/ in October this year/ lawmakers have voted in favor of adding cryptocurrencies — termed “Digital Settlement Assets” — into the proposed Financial Services and Markets Bill/ which would seek to regulate crypto as any other form of financial instruments. This includes stablecoins/ which are believed to have the “potential to develop into a widespread means of payment.” Should the government execute these measures quickly/ it could find itself a hotbed for crypto innovation — competing directly with crypto-friendly countries like Georgia/ Malta/ Singapore/ Portugal/ and the UAE (Dubai). But it will need a substantial overhaul of its crypto taxation rules to stand a chance of becoming a real crypto hub/ given that many countries tax crypto profits at 5% or less. Finally/ it remains to be seen whether the government will pass these policy changes into law — especially given arguably more demanding issues like the cost of living crisis. However/ with the seemingly consecutive implosions in crypto this year and potentially fraudulent activities from the likes of FTX / the UK is seemingly more certain about the need for greater clarity and scope of regulation/ which they believe will allow innovation to thrive while protecting consumers and businesses. Echoing this/ Minister Andrew Griffith mentioned that “there are questions about the future of crypto — but we’d be foolish to ignore the potential of the underlying technology.” The UK is certainly not ignoring the cryptocurrency industry — the government is “consulting on a world-leading regime for the rest of the cryptoasset market later this year” — but only time will tell if and when the policies implemented will be effective.

The Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) announced the launch on Dec. 15 of a pilot program with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to distribute digital cash payments to internally displaced persons (IDPs) and others affected by Russia’s invasion of the country. The Stellar Aid Assist platform is being used to distribute funds in Circle’s USDC stablecoin/ which can be redeemed for dollars/ euros or Ukrainian hryvnia at 4/500 MoneyGram locations throughout the country. The USDC is loaded onto a Vibrant digital wallet that can be downloaded onto a smartphone. The blockchain-based system allows “the delivery of cash assistance directly into the hands of those being assisted quickly/ efficiently/ and securely with full value transfer traceability and accountability/” the SDF said. “The money will provide humanitarian assistance to some of the people most impacted and vulnerable due to the war/ to help them cover basic needs like rent of accommodation/ food/ medical care and heating during the winter.” The pilot program will roll out in Kyiv/ Lviv and Vinnytsia before expanding to other towns and cities. \"Today/ we can see how blockchain technology allows us to scale humanitarian efforts in a way that wasn’t possible before/” said Deputy Minister of Digital Transformation of Ukraine on IT industry development Oleksandr Bornyakov. He added: “For fleeing Ukrainians/ and primarily for those whose banks are inaccessible/ this pilot project providing humanitarian assistance using a digital wallet/ will serve as a possible lifeline for survival.” More broadly/ the Stellar Aid Assist platform-based program “is a vivid example of how blockchain has the potential to transform and revolutionize the way humanitarian funds are allocated/” Bornyakov said/ adding: “The use of blockchain technology allows humanitarian organizations such as UNHCR to be more transparent and accountable and ensure that the most vulnerable people will have access to funds provided in their name. In this way/ humanitarian efforts around the world will be strengthened in an unprecedented way.” The Ukrainian government has embraced blockchain and cryptocurrency during the war/ raising $184 million in crypto as of Nov. 30/ according to blockchain analytics firm Crystal. Quicker and Easier This is not the first time the UN aid agencies have experimented with blockchain technology. In 2017/ the UN’s World Food Program (WFP) set up an Ethereum-based aid delivery program in the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan/ which housed 75/000 Syrian refugees. Using biometric eye scanners/ the Building Blocks program linked to cash accounts that could be used in participating facilities like a supermarket just outside the camp. The program was also an early in-the-field use of portable digital identification/ another use many blockchain advocates see as a prime target for the technology. Blockchain is one of the high-tech solutions the UNHCR has been experimenting with as part of its push to deliver assistance faster. “Speed is of the essence in humanitarian action. It’s also essential to provide people with a range of options for receiving aid/ as one size does not fit all. said Karolina Lindholm Billing/ UNHCR Representative to Ukraine. With the advent of its Cash-Based Interventions policy in 2016/ the UNHCR began focusing on getting cash directly to refugees/ which is preferred by both distributors and recipients. The UNHCR has delivered some $5 billion to 35 million people since then. It is “essential to provide people with a range of options for receiving aid/ as one size does not fit all/” said Karolina Lindholm Billing/ UNHCR Representative to Ukraine. Cash also provides a much wider choice of spending options than other forms of aid like food distribution/ and allows refugees the ability to take it not only around their country but across borders. “We are helping get funds into the hands of those who need them – and doing it quickly/ transparently/ and without the need for bank accounts or credit or debit cards. said Denelle Dixon/ CEO and executive director.of the Stellar Development Foundation.","date":"2022-12-16T14:40:07.267Z","tags":"","author":"Leo Jakobson","category":"Crypto News","id":2000008}

Crypto/ which lives and dies in the Twitterverse/ had better take notice. At least nine journalists from publications including the New York Times/ Washington Post and CNN have been banned from Twitter by its new owner/ self-proclaimed “free speech absolutist” Elon Musk. NBC News reporter Ben Collins was among those announcing the bans on — where else — Twitter beginning around 8 p.m. ET. The bans started with several reporters on the Musk beat/ but appeared to grow to include several others announcing — and criticizing — the bans. CNN veteran/ pundit and podcaster Keith Olbermann was banned shortly after posting a tweet that read/ in part: “1/So here’s a plan. EVERYBODY Retweet the screenshot of the tweet that apparently got the count of Drew Harrell of the Washington Post suspended” Harrell was suspended after a post reporting Musk’s suspension of Twitter competitor Mastodon’s account after it posted a link to its own version of the recently suspended @ElonJet account/ which tracks the private jet of the Tesla and SpaceX CEO — based on publicly available flight data. Harrell’s tweet ended/ “Loving the free speech.” While only about half of the journalists banned had been talking about @ElonJets/ the move came a day after Musk posted “Any account doxxing real-time location info of anyone will be suspended/ as it is a physical safety violation. This includes posting links to sites with real-time location info.” Wither Crypto Twitter? Several hours earlier/ on the CoinMarketCap YouTube channel/ three crypto journalists and citizen journalists joined CMC Academy’s own Connor Sephton for a discussion on “Crypto Journalism in the Age of Elon Musk’s Twitter” that focused on the impact Musk’s ownership of the social media giant will have on the cryptocurrency industry. “We’re almost a Twitter-first publication/” Bitcoin Magazine editor Pete Rizzo said. “When you're talking about delivering news and information […] to the cryptoverse you have to be on Twitter. That's kind of where everything is.” Adding that Twitter is “almost where the entire conversation takes place/” Rizzo/ who was founding editor of crypto news site CoinDesk in 2013/ said: “I think since about 2015/ it's really been the main source for crypto news. Before that/ maybe it was more Reddit/ community-based small chat rooms. But yeah/ Twitter is just so large and so dominant now. I like to say/ you know/ Twitter defines the reality of crypto. That's how big it is for our ecosystem.” Which makes selectively censoring it a problem. An interesting way to think about Twitter is as a news outlet/ which leads to the question/ “if Twitter is a new source/ who is the editor?” said Joon Ian Wong/ a crypto journalist and event creator since 2013. “Well/ it used to be the safety team/ but now the editor is Elon Musk/ right? But if you think of it in that way/ Twitter is the biggest publication on earth — far too large to be edited “with any degree of human effort/” Wong said. Pointing to the banning of @ElonJet/ Wong said/ the company came up with a broad rule banning posts about the real-time location of individuals. Which is to say/ the new “team” edited the Twitter conversation. So/ Wong asked/ “Is Twitter now a better or less useful news source? Arguably/ it's worse.” Which leads to another question that ultimately may be vital for Crypto Twitter/ Sephton said: “Is Elon Musk only committed to free speech when it suits him?”","date":"2022-12-16T14:38:02.977Z","tags":"","author":"Leo Jakobson","category":"Crypto News","id":2000009}

Prologue: SBF and crypto regulation A few weeks ago/ CoinMarketCap Academy covered the beef between Sam Bankman-Fried and other influential crypto figures like Ben \"Bitboy\" Armstrong and Ryan Sean Adams from Bankless in our weekly Twitter round-up. The TLDR: SBF had lobbied for more regulation of DeFi in front of Congress. Many people in the crypto industry vehemently opposed that. A video that made the rounds after a Bankless podcast discussion between SBF and Erik Voorhees/ an influential Bitcoin proponent/ accurately summarizes how views diverged: That was only one episode in a long series of allegations that were making the rounds on Crypto Twitter: FTX allegedly trading against its customers/ FTX listing tokens from the Solana ecosystem it backs to divest its seed round holdings/ FTX splashing the cash on big sponsorship deals. Even though FTX surged in popularity in the last two years and was very popular with well-respected figures in the space/ the narrative on the exchange and its founder Sam Bankman-Fried was already souring... Part 1: Coindesk shouts fire... The catastrophe all began with this CoinDesk article. The TLDR: There is almost no separation between FTX and Alameda Research/ Sam Bankman-Fried's hedge fund. Almost 40% of Alameda's $14.6 billion assets were locked or unlocked FTT. Another $1 billion was locked or unlocked SOL or SOL collateral. At the same time/ Alameda had $8 billion in liabilities. In conclusion/ FTT backed a lot of liabilities at Alameda/ and Alameda and FTX are very/ very close... This article made people ask questions: Why is so much FTT used as collateral at Alameda? Could Alameda get liquidated on positions if the collateral value falls? How close are Alameda and FTX in reality? Is there something funny going on...? We covered this in last week's Crypto Twitter round-up. One person reading the CoinDesk article and asking himself those exact questions was Changpeng Zhao/ the CEO of Binance. With Binance being a strategic investor in FTX/ CZ decided to pull the plug on their investment/ announcing on Nov. 6: This triggered a response from Caroline Ellison/ the CEO of Alameda Research. In response to the CoinDesk article/ she had assured everyone that the balance sheet in question was not the full picture. Alameda had another $10 billion in assets that were not covered there. $10B of assets that never were/ as everyone was about to find out. Ellison proposed buying out Binance in an OTC trade for $22/FTT: CZ did not directly respond/ but in another tweet/ he reasoned that this was \"post-exit risk management/ learning from LUNA.\" Part 2: ...so people run to the exit. Sam Trabucco/ former head of trading at Alameda/ called the CoinDesk story \"bonkers\" after it had broken. Bonkers indeed/ with the hindsight of just a few days. While these events played out/ the market was spooked. The price of FTT quickly started collapsing/ from $22 to $14/ as we headed into Monday. Still/ many believed that FTX would eventually be fine. That customer funds were not intertwined with Alameda's trading. That this was a short-term liquidity crunch at worst. This is completely different from LUNA because FTX is a revenue-generating business/ was the common consensus. Until FTX halted withdrawals. Halting withdrawals during a liquidity crunch is a cardinal sin in crypto. It had already sunk Celsius and LUNA before FTX. Initially/ on Nov. 7/ SBF assured everything is fine and FTX was just dealing with a massive amount of capital outflows/ over $500M in just two days. But then withdrawals were halted again. SBF went silent again on Twitter. Hours passed by/ as Crypto Twitter was gripped by a state of panic and FTT continued dropping. Then this happened on Nov. 9: \"A strategic transaction for FTX.com/\" as SBF explained/ meant Binance would acquire FTX. Just like this/ Binance seemingly looks on its way to buy FTX/ in one of the most shocking developments in the crypto industry. Or did he? In the announcement by both CEOs/ it was stated that this transaction was \"subject to due diligence.\" In other words/ Binance would take a good long look at FTX’s financials before deciding if they would go forward with the deal. Part 3: fire breaks out for real. As soon as the market realized that this acquisition was far from assured/ panic set back in. FTT plummeted into single digits. So did the rest of the market. Monday turned into Tuesday and the decision on the deal has yet to be announced/ while customers' funds are still stuck on FTX. Up Only/ a popular crypto podcast/ hosted a spontaneous episode covering the utter mayhem that was unfolding in the markets. An Up Only summary covers the details but the biggest news was Do Kwon and Martin Shkreli joining the episode (with Shkreli telling Kwon that \"jail is not that bad\"). Oh/ and Su Zhu/ CEO of another failed hedge fund 3AC/ reemerged as well. Talk about an eventful week. The news coming out of FTX was getting worse by the hour. The majority of its legal team supposedly quit. The SEC is investigating the exchange. Eventually/ the announcement came on Nov. 10: Binance was not pursuing a deal to buy FTX. In short/ the situation was catastrophic. As it turns out/ there may be a $9.4B hole. Just how bad it is can only be inferred from what Brian Armstrong/ CEO of Coinbase/ is not saying: FTX supposedly approached all major exchanges/ but only Gemini and Kraken showed interest. None of them followed through/ though. Part 4: what now? So what happened? There is still no clarity on exactly how FTX and Alameda got themselves into this situation. Lucas Nuzzi traced on-chain data back to a potential bailout for Alameda covered by FTX funds. Alameda apparently blew up during 3AC collapse and FTX customer funds were used to plug the hole. This was not only illegal but also very dangerous since these funds did not really appear on Alameda's balance sheet. What did appear was FTX's token marked as equity. Or in the words of Lyn Alden/ its \"clown bucks:\" The lessons from CZ struck a similar note: don't use your own token as collateral/ and don't use customer funds to trade on the market. Rumor has it that these illegal business practices have been going on since 2021. Most of the FTX team has gone dark since. According to a leaked SBF letter to investors/ refunding customers is a priority. However/ investors like Sequoia have written off their investments. A Slack message seen by news outlet Reuters quotes SBF saying he feels \"sorry\" for the situation. Another verified message cites Bankman-Fried saying on Slack that FTX is planning to conduct a raise by next week to \"do right by customers\" (and \"maybe myself as an investor\"). Justin Sun came in with an undefined \"solution\" via his Tron blockchain/ causing the price of Tron to trade at multiples on FTX compared to liquid exchanges. This was later updated to FTX processing withdrawals via the Tron network/ amounting to a steep haircut for those that buy TRX. Part 5: SBF speaks. On Thursday morning/ Sam Bankman-Fried reemerged with the following intro: In a nutshell/ SBF blames the collapse on \"poor internal labeling of bank-related accounts\" and maintains that FTX has enough assets to cover client deposits. Industry figures almost univocally slammed SBF for his thread. Anthony Sassano said he \"didn't believe a single word.\" Altcoin Psycho questioned why Alameda would be \"winding down trading.\" Cobie felt \"even more confused/\" while others just took the meme route: Meanwhile/ U.S. law enforcement asked Tether to freeze FTX-related USDT and lawmakers are calling for an investigation. BlockFi paused withdrawals. The Bahamas Securities Commission froze FTX’s assets. Bizarrely/ a small circle of people seems to have been in control of financials while co-living and dating in the Bahamas headquarters. Over the weekend/ Reuters reported that SBF had set up a “backdoor” to alter the company’s financial records without triggering internal compliance (SBF denied this). The Wall Street Journal reported that several FTX executives knew about customer funds being moved to Alameda. In an even more shocking turn of events/ over the weekend on Nov. 12/ a combination of black-hat and white-hat hacking drained FTX of hundreds of millions. The true extent of the hack is still unknown: The FTX app was compromised as well/ which reportedly contained malware if users update/ as announced on the official FTX telegram channel: Part 6: the fallout. The fallout from this collapse is colossal. With FTX filing for bankruptcy/ the true extent of contagion will continue surfacing over the following months. There is a long list of prominent FTX investors and other crypto exchanges and entities with exposure to FTT. Galaxy Digital confirmed a $76.8 million exposure/ but other funds have been eerily quiet for now. BlockFi paused withdrawals and will likely go under due to its exposure to FTX. DeFi price oracles partially depend on FTX prices and are impacted by the converging prices on the exchange compared to others. Miners are turning rigs off as a result of the collapsing Bitcoin price. The court case could take years to resolve and many believe those with funds stuck on (or stolen from) FTX are unlikely to see most of it ever again: Regulators were quick to call for harsher regulation of the industry/ conveniently overlooking the fact that FTX US was the U.S.-regulated branch of FTX (and was also brought down by the bankruptcy). Even more interesting are the close ties between US regulators and the families of FTX executives. Crypto Twitter was rife with conspiracy theories/ but several threads also posed fair questions about the true motives of SBF cozying up to Gary Gensler and other US financial authorities. On Crypto Twitter/ the number one reaction was anger. Anger about SBF sitting in front of Congress seemingly projecting when he speaks about collapsing TradFi institutions with \"unknown amounts of risk.\" Anger about a seeming God-savior complex permeating the FTX team. Anger about how much this will set back the industry as a whole: At the time of writing/ SBF still seems to be in the Bahamas/ albeit “under supervision” of local authorities. Epilogue: is crypto now done? Anyone that has browsed Crypto Twitter over the last few days is feeling the sentiment of utter devastation among those working in crypto. While the collapse of LUNA caught many off-guard/ several figures had been flashing warning signs about its unsustainable business model. But FTX was different. Or so it seemed. An exchange run by a man many tipped to be the \"next Warren Buffet.\" A functioning business with real revenues and a network that extended to the highest political circles in Washington. To investors/ SBF had pitched FTX as a financial \"everything app.\" An app where you would not only trade crypto but eventually do all your personal finance on. Unsurprisingly/ many honest and well-meaning industry figures and key opinion leaders advertised for FTX. Although doubts were creeping in recently/ no one imagined such a catastrophic failure. So/ is this the end of crypto? The cryptocurrency industry will over the coming months and years have to take a hard look in the mirror. 2022 has been/ by all standards/ a catastrophic year for the industry. It has proven crypto doubters right on almost every account. Only by embracing ethical business practices can crypto slowly and over time win back customer trust. Practices like proof of reserves are a good first step. But they can only be the first of many. Most likely it will set crypto back by years/ both in terms of valuation and loss of trust. The pitchforks are well and truly out now and that is understandable. FTX almost certainly engaged in highly criminal behavior. Law enforcement will almost certainly come into this at some point. And contagion risks are almost certainly still out there. After all/ FTX seemingly got caught up in contagion itself and almost managed to sweep it under the rug. Even if a somewhat orderly dissolution of the exchange happens/ many will simply not trust crypto anymore. Even though Bitcoiners feel validated by industry excesses/ it is not as simple as renouncing all coins but Bitcoin. The responsibility of all to be good actors in the industry is even greater if crypto wants to be adopted by the masses.

It’s a motto that’s shaped Nigeria’s modern-day culture/ and has no doubt contributed to its citizens’ rapid adoption of all things Web3. State of Nigeria’s Economy: High Inflation and Weakening Currency Since declaring independence from Britain in 1960/ after nearly a hundred years of colonial rule/ Nigeria has become the sixth most populous country globally/ and the most populated country in Africa. The country’s $440bn economy is the largest in Africa/ and it was one of the fastest growing economies in 2019. Nigeria’s economic makeup has changed considerably over the past generation; its service/ financial/ and tech sectors have grown/ which has led to more citizens moving to cities for jobs. Yet despite its wealth/ relative to other African countries/ Nigeria’s economy ranks 26th worldwide when measured by GDP/ and 162nd when calculated by GDP per capita (which refers to the average per-person output in Nigeria). Indeed/ the number of poor Nigerians is predicted to reach 95 million in 2022 — nearly 50% of the population — and four in ten Nigerians already live below the national poverty line/ according to world bank estimates. Several factors contribute to Nigeria’s high poverty rates today. There was the oil price collapse in 2014 which led to the country’s first recession in 25 years/ thanks to the country’s heavy reliance on oil exports. The Nigerian economy has also suffered from high inflation — hitting a 17-year high of 20.8% — compared to 8.2% for the United States. Additionally/ Nigeria’s currency – the Naira – has depreciated by 10.6% annually on average since 1973/ which has worsened poverty rates across the country and exacerbated its already stubbornly high inflation. When asked why the Naira was continuously deprecating/ Nigeria’s central bank governor Godwin Emefiele explained that because Nigeria’s markets are so reliant on oil exports/ whenever there’s a drop in crude oil prices/ foreign investors pull out of the markets. And because crude oil sales account for about 90% of Nigeria’s incoming foreign currency/ when foreign investors pull out/ there follows a drop in the supply of foreign exchange into the country. Whether oil prices are as important as the governor makes them out to be is debatable/ but one thing’s for sure: many of Nigeria’s biggest problems relate to its national currency. Given the impact of the Naira’s weakening/ and the country’s intractably high inflation/ is it any wonder that Nigerians now use crypto for cross-border trade and to protect their wealth? Source: qz.com It should come as no surprise that as of July this year/ according to a report by Morning Consult/ one in two Nigerian adults reportedly trade crypto at least once a month — the highest proportion of any population on earth. Moreover/ Nigeria was ranked sixth on the 2021 crypto adoption index (although it did slip to 11th in the 2022 edition). But besides protecting their wealth from currency depreciation and inflation/ what other reasons might explain Nigeria’s positive attitude toward cryptocurrencies? Why the High Crypto Adoption Rate in Nigeria? That most Nigerians lack access to financial services is one explanation/ according to analysis from KuCoin/ a popular cryptocurrency exchange. Fewer than one in four Nigerian adults have a bank account/ according to a 2018 survey carried out by EFINA/ although more recent data shows more citizens are opening bank accounts. Additionally/ there’s still 64 million people unbanked in Nigeria/ according to the World Bank/ and Nigeria is one of seven countries whose unbanked citizens constitute half of the total unbanked population worldwide. The government’s ban on certain industries paying for certain imports using foreign currency (they mainly pay with US dollars) left some businesses with no choice but to pay for their products with crypto. The ban came in several stages starting in 2015/ and in 2019 Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari extended it to include some additional goods he felt should be produced in Nigeria rather than imported. He was quoted in a statement telling the central bank “don’t give a cent to anybody to import food into the country.” This line of thinking — that people shouldn’t pay for imports using foreign currency — is consistent among other countries where crypto has been quickly adopted/ like Pakistan/ ranking sixth in global crypto adoption rates. Like other countries with low GDP per capita/ plenty of Nigerians move abroad to study and find better paying jobs/ which allows them to send money home in the form of remittances. Data from Nigeria’s central bank shows that remittances have grown consistently over the past decade/ rising 2.6% to $5.03bn in the first quarter of 2022. While the government encourages its expats to send money via commercial banks/ many Nigerians are aware that the banks’ remittance fees — an average of 7.07% in 2020 according to the World Bank — eat into their payments/ and that they could potentially keep more of their money by using crypto instead. We should also consider crypto’s usefulness in getting money to people in need — whether they are in a humanitarian crisis/ or have their accounts sanctioned by the state. In October 2020/ the Nigerian government was rocked by some of the biggest protests in decades. The protestors marched against police brutality and the notorious SARS (Special Anti-Robbery Squad) police squad/ which had a long record of abusing Nigerian citizens. Water cannons and tear gas were used to beat back the protestors — more than 50 of whom were killed/ and dozens of members of civil society and protest groups had their bank accounts frozen. In response/ and with some help from famous crypto advocates like Jack Dorsey/ the #EndSARS supporters got funds to the protestors using Bitcoin/ helping them to avoid the sanctions and continue their protests. That these protesters could use cryptocurrencies to circumvent sanctions sent shockwaves through the Nigerian political class. One crypto platform operator spoke to the Guardian anonymously and said: “They know they can’t really stop it. It’s out of their control/ and what scares them is they are not used to being in this position.” Scared they were/ but they quickly responded by banning crypto entirely — or so it seemed. Nigeria Central Bank Bans Crypto? In February 2021/ the Nigeria central bank released a letter to all banks and financial firms who operate in Nigeria which cautioned them against using cryptocurrency/ and reminded them that “dealing in crypto currencies or facilitating payments for cryptocurrency exchanges is prohibited.” The letter also asked all recipients to identify persons operating crypto exchanges and ensure their accounts are closed immediately. This letter understandably led many journalists to believe (and report) that crypto was entirely banned in Nigeria. However/ the central bank later clarified that its letter did not constitute a total ban/ nor was it meant to discourage people from trading cryptocurrency. Instead/ the bank argued/ it was merely reiterating a pre-existing ban on banks facilitating crypto transactions that was implemented in 2017/ and which was part of the government’s drive for Nigeria to become a cashless society. Speaking at a seminar in the Nigerian capital/ Abuja/ central bank deputy governor Adamu Lamtek clarified further: “What we have just done was to prohibit transactions on cryptocurrencies in the banking sector.” Before the letter’s publication/ Nigerians often bought crypto through legitimate commercial banks; doing so was considered the safest method by which they could use digital currencies. But when all of a sudden these banks couldn’t facilitate crypto transactions on their behalf/ they were forced to rely on untrustworthy platforms to keep their businesses afloat. By using these dubious platforms/ many people fell victim to scams and fraudulent schemes. Others thankfully discovered peer-to-peer platforms/ which meant they could continue using crypto to import goods with an added bonus of not paying the banks any fees. The e-Naira — Nigeria’s Answer to Crypto? This series of events/ in addition to the Naira’s continuous depreciation/ inspired the Nigerian government to contrive a way for its citizens to gain all (or at least most) of the advantages from using blockchain and encourage greater use of the Naira. In the end/ they decided to build a central bank digital currency/ or CBDC/ called the e-Naira. CBDCs work similarly to cryptocurrencies in that they use digital ledgers (although not necessarily a blockchain) to record transactions. In a way/ CBDCs are perhaps most similar to stablecoins because both are pegged to a fiat currency. You use them just like the cash on your credit card/ only from an account that the central bank assigns to you. Despite their apparent similarities/ it’s important to keep in mind that there are many differences between CBDCs and cryptocurrencies. One key difference is that CBDCs are centralized/ meaning they are controlled by a government or central bank; whereas cryptocurrencies are decentralized and therefore not under anyone’s control. And unlike the cash they represent/ CBDCs don’t let you pay for goods and services privately; whereas cryptocurrencies are pseudonymous/ which means your transactions appear under a pseudonym (usually your wallet address). Some of these differences are cause for serious concern. Each and every CBDC transaction/ for instance/ leaves a digital fingerprint which the state can monitor/ which means CBDCs don’t reproduce one of cash’s key benefits: privacy. In theory/ the state could monitor which political party you pay membership to/ which newspapers and books you buy/ or even where you buy your coffee from/ provided you pay for those goods and services with CBDCs. The state could also prevent citizens from buying or selling certain items via the CBDC code itself; items that could/ for instance/ be used to protest against police brutality and oppression/ or books that might promote different ideas than those the state approves of. And lastly/ some have expressed concerns that in times of economic uncertainty/ people could move their money from traditional bank accounts and into CBDCs. This could create an e-run on the banks because only a fraction of bank deposits are backed by actual cash and eligible for withdrawal/ thanks to the fractional reserve system the banks use today. It wouldn’t be fair/ however/ to say that CBDCs like Nigeria’s e-Naira are entirely without merit. They could allow the central bank to airdrop money to individual citizens/ or citizens of a certain demographic/ or those who live in a certain area/ without first ascertaining their bank details/ which would be highly useful during financial crises or natural disasters. Additionally/ CBDCs could compel the big banks to innovate more in the payments and current account sector/ which they overwhelmingly dominate today with legacy infrastructure. Overall/ however/ it should by now be clear that the e-Naira and every other CBDC are merely digital versions of the fiat currencies they supplement/ only with a few crypto-like quirks mixed in with a lot of crypto-like marketing. They don’t offer any of the privacy benefits that cryptocurrencies do/ nor do they protect their users — including Nigerians who use the e-Naira — from inflation or currency depreciation. And yet/ these drawbacks did not dissuade Nigeria’s central bank from launching a CBDC in October 2021. When Nigeria launched the e-Naira/ it became the first African country/ and the second country worldwide/ to launch a CBDC. During the launch/ $200 million worth of e-Naira was issued to an assortment of banks and financial institutions in order to encourage them and their customers to use the new CBDC. The central bank considered the launch a great success after 33 banks and 120 merchants registered with the e-Naira platform during the launch event. Shortly after the launch/ President Buhari said e-Naira adoption could “increase Nigeria’s GDP by $29bn over the next 10 years.” However/ not everyone agreed that the e-Naira would solve the biggest issues that Nigerians faced. Because it’s pegged to the Naira itself/ it’s unclear how or why an e-Naira would more effectively protect Nigerians’ wealth from inflation or currency devaluation than/ say/ stocks/ bonds/ gold/ Bitcoin/ Ethereum/ or even a dollar-backed stablecoin like USDC. Another question that hasn’t yet been answered is: if nobody wants to buy Naira/ why would anyone want to buy an e-Naira? Future of Crypto in Nigeria In spite of these problems/ data gathered three months after the launch showed the e-Naira app was still downloaded nearly 700/000 times from 160 countries/ and had supported 35/000 transactions. These figures/ while somewhat encouraging/ don’t actually paint a particularly successful picture when you consider the fact that in El Salvador/ three million people downloaded the government’s Chivo app within a comparable timeframe. For context/ El Salvador’s population is one thirtieth the size of Nigeria’s. Furthermore/ after asking dozens of Nigerian business owners for their opinion on the e-Naira/ Al Jazeera journalists discovered that most Nigerians they spoke to had never even heard of it. So it seems that despite the Nigerian government’s attempts at enticing its citizens away from decentralized currencies through its CBDC/ Nigerian citizens just aren’t that interested. In fact/ crypto adoption has steadily ticked upwards across Nigeria despite the e-Naira’s release: KuCoin reports that 33.4 million Nigerians traded or owned crypto assets as of April 2022/ in spite of the e-Naira’s launch and the restrictions on trading crypto. And yet/ in spite of Nigerians skirting sanctions and importing goods using cryptocurrencies/ the Nigerian government has in fact warmed to the crypto space. Well/ a bit. In early September/ the Nigerian Export Processing Zones Authority — which regulates and operates free trade zones in Nigeria — began discussions with Binance about developing a dedicated free zone for blockchain and crypto firms/ similar to Dubai’s virtual free zone. Although a deal hasn’t yet emerged/ it’s a step in the right direction/ and shows the Nigerian government is starting to get serious about becoming a major player in the Web3 economy.

Find out below.","title":"What Are Cross-Chain Bridges? | CoinMarketCap","detailedContent":"Another week/ another cross-chain bridge hack. Cross-chain bridges seemingly appear to be constant targets of hackers/ and with millions of dollars lost in these hacks/ one might wonder — why the need for blockchain bridges? There are over hundreds of blockchains with different features and use cases. While blockchain technology has continued to gain traction and attract more users/ the issue of interoperability between different siloed blockchains has remained a major challenge. Currently/ blockchains exist largely as isolated networks that cannot effectively communicate and share data with one another. For instance/ Ethereum users cannot deploy smart contracts on the Bitcoin network and Bitcoin holders cannot use their tokens for transactions on the Ethereum network. Put simply/ cross-chain bridges connect individual blockchains/ enabling the transfer of assets and information between them. This allows interoperability across blockchains — allowing users to access protocols and decentralized applications (DApps) in a multi-chain manner. Cross-chain bridges have emerged as one of the available solutions that are being used to connect different blockchains and ecosystems within the crypto space. Subscribe Join us in showcasing the cryptocurrency revolution/ one newsletter at a time. Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox/ along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right/ millions love us!) — what are you waiting for? What Are Cross-chain Bridges? A cross-chain bridge/ otherwise known as a blockchain bridge/ is a protocol that connects two blockchains/ allowing users to transfer digital assets and information from one blockchain to another. It is more or less a ‘middleman’ that connects different blockchains/ facilitating token transfers/ smart contracts and data exchange/ as well as communication between two independent chains. For instance/ if you have Bitcoin and want to spend it on the Ethereum blockchain/ a cross-chain bridge will make this possible/ by wrapping BTC. Blockchain bridges grew in popularity partly due to the rise of “alternative” layer-ones blockchains/ such as Solana/ Avalanche and BNB Chain. These so-called “Ethereum-killers” attempted to win market share/ and users/ from the first smart-contract chain. However/ many users had funds locked up on Ethereum. Bridges gave them a seamless way to move their assets over to other chains. In general/ having access to multiple blockchains through a single network enhances the experience of users/ increases liquidity for DApps and enhances efficiency of assets. How Does a Cross-Chain Bridge Work? Although cross-chain bridges can be used for other cool stuff like converting smart contracts and sending data/ the most common utility is token transfer. Before blockchain bridges/ you’d have to rely on the services of centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Binance or Coinbase if you want to use a particular asset on another blockchain. Let’s assume you have some BTC on the Bitcoin blockchain and want to move these tokens to the Ethereum blockchain/ which has a native ETH token. To make this happen/ you will need to send your BTC to a cross-chain bridge/ which will hold your coin and create equivalents in ETH for you to use. In reality/ your BTC is not transferred from the Bitcoin to the Ethereum network. Instead/ it is locked in a smart contract that gives you access to an equivalent amount in wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) that can be used on the Ethereum blockchain. If you decide to convert the wBTC back to BTC/ whatever is left of the wrapped token will be destroyed (burn) while you receive an equivalent amount of BTC. Read: What Is Wrapped Bitcoin? A cross-chain bridge would allow you to convert and use your BTC on the Ethereum network without going through a tedious process on a CEX. It works by wrapping tokens in a smart contract and then issuing native assets that can be used on another blockchain of choice. Why Are Cross-Chain Bridges Important in the Crypto Ecosystem? To understand the importance of cross-chain bridges in the crypto space/ it is necessary to understand how interoperability is powering seamless transactions in traditional finance. You may not have noticed but you can use your Visa to pay for your Mastercard bills. Similarly/ you can use PayPal to pay for virtually all your online purchases irrespective of where you are buying from. These are all different companies/ operating different systems and protocols. Yet/ transactions are fast and seamless. The lack of interoperability between different blockchains has been touted as one of the hurdles preventing the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies. As a result/ solutions like cross-chain bridges are a big step towards the wider adoption of blockchain technology. Blockchain bridges also help to lower transaction costs while providing a better user experience. Imagine having to go through different exchanges each time you need to swap a token. Apart from the higher fees associated with doing this every time/ the process is quite cumbersome. In general/ cross-chain bridges allow users to enjoy the best features from two different blockchains/ such as lower gas fees with higher transaction throughput/ and better utility in the form of DApps. Notable Cross-Chain Bridge Hacks in 2022 To use the services of a cross-chain bridge/ users face smart contract risks/ amongst other things. Decentralized bridges are trustless/ using oracles and smart contracts to manage the bridging of assets. However/ smart contracts are prone to vulnerabilities. Moreover/ the nascency of the technology means that many new design models are still being built and tested/ thereby presenting other novel attack vectors that can be exploited. In August 2022/ Chainalysis released a report claiming that about $2 billion worth of cryptocurrencies had been stolen across 13 separate cross-chain bridge attacks since the beginning of the year. According to the report/ attacks on bridges make up nearly 70% of the total funds stolen between January and August 2022. Here are some of the top cross-chain bridge hacks in 2022. Ronin Bridge Hack The Ronin Bridge attack might go down in history as the largest DeFi exploit ever committed. In late March/ the ETH sidechain built for the popular play-to-earn (P2E) game Axie Infinity was compromised. The attackers made away with over 173/600 Ether (ETH) and 25.5 million USD Coin (USDC)/ valued at more than $600 million at that time. According to the company/ the hackers gained entry through the private keys to validator nodes/ resulting in the compromise of five validator nodes. There are claims that the North Korean Lazarus Group was responsible for the attack/ with later reports showing how an advanced phishing attack was used to get the private keys to the validator nodes. Wormhole Hack A month before the Ronin incident/ another cross-chain bridge had already been hacked. On February 2/ 2022/ the second-largest cross-chain bridge exploit happened on the Wormhole Bridge. Wormhole is a “decentralized/ universal message-passing protocol that connects to multiple blockchains.” A post-analysis of the event revealed that the attacker was able to bypass the verification process of the protocol. This led to the loss of 120/000 Wormhole Ethereum (wETH)/ close to $325 million. To carry out the attack/ the hacker forged a valid signature for a transaction that allowed them to mint 120/000 wETH without first inputting an equivalent amount. This was then exchanged for around $250 million in Ethereum. Two minutes after the attack/ the attacker bridged 10/000 ETH to the Ethereum blockchain and another 80/000 ETH about 20 minutes later/ effectively amounting to nearly $250 million. Interestingly/ the funds are still sitting in the attacker’s wallets to this day. Harmony Bridge Hack Another recent cross-chain bridge hack is that of the Harmony chain/ which happened at around 11AM UTC on June 23/ 2022. On the said say/ the bridge between Harmony chain and Ethereum suffered multiple exploits. Some security experts were able to identify twelve attack transactions and three attack addresses. Surprisingly/ the Lazarus Group/ a well-known North Korean hacking syndicate/ was identified as the primary suspect behind the incident. The group used the login credentials of Harmony employees in the Asia Pacific region to gain entry into the protocol’s security system. Once in/ the hackers deployed automated laundering programs that transferred the stolen assets late at night. They netted a plethora of tokens on the bridge/ including ETH/ USDC/ WBTC/ USDT/ DAI/ BUSD/ AAG/ FXS/ SUSHI/ AAVE/ WETH and FRAX/ with varying values between $49/178 and $41/200/000. In total/ the protocol lost around $100 million worth of assets. Nomad Bridge Hack In the beginning of August 2022/ Nomad token bridge suffered a security breach that allowed the attackers to systematically drain a large portion of the protocol’s funds over a long series of transactions. Over $190 million was removed from the bridge/ leaving just $651.54 in the protocol’s wallet. However/ the company told reporters that some of the funds were withdrawn by “white hat friends” who took the funds out to safeguard them. However/ 24 hours later/ only $9 million out of the $190.7 million had been returned. Unlike other blockchain bridge hacks/ the incident saw hundreds of addresses receiving tokens from the bridge/ in what could be best described as a free for all. Top Cross-Chain Bridges As with blockchains/ there are quite a number of cross-chain protocols. The image above gives an idea of the number of blockchain bridges operating across different networks. Portal Token Bridge (formerly Wormhole) Despite the February hack/ Portal has remained one of the most popular cross-chain bridges in the space. Although originally built on the Solana Network for bi-directional crypto token transfers between Solana and Ethereum/ the multichain now connects over ten blockchains/ including Solana/ Ethereum/ BNB Chain/ Polygon/ Avalanche/ Oasis and more. Portal uses special validators known as Guardians to provide its users with a robust cross-chain swap experience. The Guardians monitor the activity on the bridge and verify user requests. In addition to its beginner-friendly interface/ Portal token bridge also offers competitive transaction fees of $0.0001 per transfer. The protocol has so far processed over $400k transactions and has a total value locked (TVL) of $469 million at the time of writing. Binance Bridge Coming from the world’s leading exchange/ Binance Bridge is an Ethereum-BNB Smart Chain Bridge that allows anyone to convert into and from the BNB Smart Chain and other BSC-compatible formats. At the time of writing/ the Binance Bridge supports the conversion of ERC-20 tokens along with coins on other networks like XRP/ LINK/ ATOM/ DOT/ XTZ and ONT. It is worth mentioning that the bridge charges zero fees for transactions. Users are only required to pay the gas fees on the native and destination chains. Avalanche Bridge The Avalanche Bridge is a two-way cross-chain bridge between Avalanche and the Ethereum network. It uses ChainSafe’s ChainBridge to enable two-way transfers of both crypto tokens and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The protocol depends on Relayers to secure the bridge. These Relayers (Protofire/ Hashquark/ POA Network/ Avascan) compare the proposal to swap assets against Avalanche’s data and approve or reject the proposal through a voting process. This additional voting process makes Avalanche one of the most secure crypto bridges in the space. Fantom AnySwap Bridge Like the Avalanche Bridge/ Fantom’s AnySwap is a bi-directional solution that facilitates cross-chain transfers between the Ethereum Network and the EVM-compatible Fantom Network. AnySwap provides a multi-chain liquidity solution and uses liquidity pools to enable cross-chain swaps. The liquidity pools deployed across various blockchain networks facilitate transfer to Fantom from Ethereum/ Avalanche/ Polygon and the BNB Chain.

Well almost. You probably read about it already in our news but a hacker attacked BNB Chain/ so we’ll talk about that one as well. Haven’t had a juicy hack in a long time/ haven’t we? Here’s what else was up on Crypto Twitter last week. Who Went Viral This Time? Before the attack on BNB Chain/ there was actually plenty of buzz around upcoming token launches and possible airdrops. Here’s a thread by Olimpio Crypto on a possible soon-to-come ZK token airdrop: Plenty of useful strategies for the upcoming mainnet launch on Oct. 28. Olimpio goes through a couple of interesting protocols you may want to play around with. We covered a couple more in our Deep Dive Into the ZK Sync Ecosystem. Competitor Arbitrum was covered by two good threads last week. Here’s one by Sandra Leow covering the latest developments in the ecosystem: Sandra compiled the best resources about Arbitrum into one megathread/ with threads about ecosystem alpha/ rollups/ the best projects/ and strategies for Arbitrum. The second thread by 0xtypejohnny covered a potential Arbitrum airdrop: He dives deep into good strategies and protocols to farm a potential airdrop. You can find more info about Arbitrum in our Deep Dive Into the Arbitrum Ecosystem What else? The Cosmos blockchain is out with a massive upgrade to its token economy and ecosystem. Route2FI summarized the new ATOM 2.0 whitepaper in a thread: We’ll cover the Cosmos 2.0 upgrade in a separate ecosystem guide next week! And/ of course/ another viral thread from the ever reliable ZachXBT. This time he covered the Beeple Twitter hack/ which saw $450K stolen: Who Is Arguing In Way Too Public A Place? After the dramafest last week/ we saw a bit of mean reversal this week. Very little drama except for Elon/ who started a certified non-crypto-related shitstorm. The one thing we did note was Michael Saylor being…dunked on? Sort of. However/ Mr. Saylor parried that one nicely: That fits quite nicely with our upcoming deep dive into Lightning Network that’s coming out soon. Another last-minute addition was this new revelation by ZachXBT: Lark Davis has not responded yet to this new accusation/ but it looks like there will be more fire where this smoke is coming from. However/ the real drama took place in Elon’s timeline… Elon and Saylor Say Stuff Elon/ never one to shy away from a controversial statement/ took it upon himself to post a loaded poll this week: Oof/ did you really have to Elon? Needless to say that the comment section was explosive. You can see for yourself here. As any good troll would do/ Elon then doubled down on his/ ahem/ unscientific poll: Since this isn’t crypto-related/ we won’t dive into the shitstorm this started (which eventually landed Elon on Russian TV too!). Let’s just say that some things are better left unsaid. Talk of the Town The talk of the town was obviously the Binance bridge hack. This tweet kicked it all off: In total/ 2 million BNB were stolen. Not a bad loot/ even by crypto standards. Samczun broke the technical details down in a thread: Unsurprisingly/ some Ethereu maxis were not too impressed with Binance’s response: However/ the Binance team resolved the issue arguably quite fast (probably one of the perks of having a not-too-decentralized chain!): A less commendable case of customer support was on display by the failing CEX lender Celsius. After doxxing every single user in a court document/ Crypto Twitter reacted with utter disgust: Say about decentralized apps what you want/ but at least they’re proceeding with retroactive airdrops instead of retroactive doxxes! Our Favorite Coinfession This one may sound all too familiar to a couple of crypto degens: Monkey see green candle/ monkey act! Stay off the revenge trading anon/ it’s not going to do you any good.

This article looks at soulbound tokens (SBTs)/ their use cases and their benefits and drawbacks. Subscribe Join us in showcasing the cryptocurrency revolution/ one newsletter at a time. Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox/ along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right/ millions love us!) — what are you waiting for? What Are SBTs? Soulbound tokens (SBTs) were conceived by Ethereum founder/ Vitalik Buterin/ in a blog post. He describes them as a way to \"eschew today's hyper-financialization\" of Web3. They are to become a building block of a decentralized society/ or desoc for short/ which will overhaul people's relationships/ reputation management and building and managing communities. Technically/ soulbound tokens are non-transferable NFTs/ i.e./ unique and public verifiable tokens. Buterin envisions them \"encoding social relationships of trust\" and facilitating the move to a decentralized society. For instance/ such tokens could act as tokenized representations of a CV or represent affiliations/ credentials/ achievements and memberships. SBTs are not 1:1 representations of humans. Instead/ they are tied to an individual/ an organization or an entity. Specifically/ they are bound to a wallet for its lifespan. For example/ SBTs can show a record of history by an individual/ such as employment history. However/ the same individual (or entity) could have another SBT representing their non-professional affiliations. As such/ it is possible to have several \"Souls.\" As we wrote above/ SBTs have also been described as non-transferrable NFTs. While non-fungible tokens are unique assets belonging to an unknown wallet/ SBTs are unique records of data belonging to a unique entity. Unlike NFTs/ which can be freely traded for financial gain/ SBTs do not have financial value and cannot be traded since their owner is clearly defined. Benefits of Soulbound Tokens Soulbound tokens have several benefits. First and foremost/ they could increase trust in the Web3 space. Web3 still relies on Web2 tools to solve representation and trust problems. For instance/ to unlock the full functionality of NFTs/ you need Twitter or Instagram (to show them as profile pictures) and OpenSea (to trade them). Other examples are DAOs relying on Discord voting to pre-empt Sybil attacks or DeFi credit markets relying on over-collateralization to ensure counterparty trust. However/ with SBTs/ you could endorse an individual or entity after having done business with them. Equally/ they would tie a loan to a verifiable entity/ unlocking a social aspect of credit and enabling undercollateralized loans. Thus/ soulbound tokens make possible a better representation of integrity/ trust and affiliations. They would move Web3 away from a money-oriented framework and towards reputation-based/ cooperative frameworks. In essence/ they enable desoc by working with the same principles: composability/ cooperation/ trust and reputation management owned and governed by network users. How Can SBTs Be Used? SBTs have several interesting use cases. NFT Art NFT owners still need centralized platforms/ like OpenSea/ to highlight their ownership of digital collectibles. With SBTs/ it would be possible to prove the provenance of a non-fungible token by linking it to its owner's Soul (aka their unique wallet). DAOs DAOs would be able to become \"soul-backed\" and massively improve their social coordination mechanisms. In their current form/ DAOs are vulnerable to Sybil attacks/ spam attacks that allow attackers to create multiple wallets to have more voting power. With soulbound tokens/ DAOs would be able to distinguish between real Souls and fake wallets. Furthermore/ Souls with several SBTs could be given more voting power/ as their record of trust would be higher. Uncollateralized Lending The privacy-focused nature of crypto loans means there is no social credit feature to loaning money. Thus/ enforcement of trust happens economically/ meaning through over-collateralization. With SBTs/ such a social credit feature would be introduced. Vitalik Buterin wrote in his whitepaper: \"Loans and credit lines could be represented as non-transferable but revocable SBTs/ so they are nested amongst a Soul's other SBTs—a kind of non-seizable reputational collateral—until they are repaid and subsequently burned/ or better yet/ replaced with proof of repayment. SBTs offer useful security properties: non-transferability prevents transferring or hiding outstanding loans/ while a rich ecosystem of SBTs ensures that borrowers who try to escape their loans (perhaps by spinning up a fresh Soul) will lack SBTs to meaningfully stake their reputation.\" Thus/ soulbound tokens could enable a tokenized/ transparent and decentralized version of credit scores. Certifications and Documentations Another potentially promising field is certifications and documentation currently collected on centralized ledgers \"behind closed doors.\" For instance/ academic records or certifications not applying to a universal standard would be recorded by SBTs/ creating a \"proof of history\" that cannot be tampered with. Proof-of-Presence Equally interesting would be proof of attendance records of real-life or digital events and gatherings. For instance/ academic attendance could be recorded with a soulbound token/ connecting it to a student's academic record and/ later/ to their record of employment. Digital CV Finally/ SBTs could streamline employment records and increase their transparency. Even today/ checking the veracity of an applicant's employment record is difficult. This is/ even more/ the case if you take into account records across different industries or countries. Soulbound tokens would provide a verifiable digital CV that increases an applicant's reputation. How Do SBTs Work in Web3? SBTs still do not exist on a widescale. However/ conceptually they would be bound to a single crypto wallet and would be non-transferable. In essence/ they would be similar to NFTs but without the transferability and financial features of the latter. SBTs vs NFTs NFTs are transferrable and contain a verifiably unique piece of information recorded on the blockchain/ such as the data of a digital piece of art. They are not bound to a wallet or a single owner. SBTs are not transferrable and contain verifiably unique information about their unique owner (their Soul)/ such as employment or medical records/ certifications and others. They are bound to a single Soul. One Soul can have several SBTs with qualitatively different pieces of information. What Are Examples of SBTs in Action? Examples of future uses of soulbound tokens are: Proof of NFT provenance DAO voting Undercollateralized lending in DeFi Proof of attendance Digital employment records Digital proof of certifications/ documentation/ badges/ and others Digital medical history Airdrops bound to Souls What Are Binance Account Bound Token (BABT)? Binance Account Bound Tokens (BABT) are soulbound tokens on the BNB Chain. They are bound to the users that completed KYC verification and have no monetary value. BABT serves purely as a verifications tool for Binance users. What Happens If You Lose Your Soul? If you lose your Soul/ your token(s) would be recovered through social recovery. You appoint several \"Guardians\" to your SBTs/ who can change the wallet keys with the approval of the majority. Such \"Guardians\" could be trusted individuals/ organizations or others. However/ this mechanism relies on continuous good relations with your Guardians. Another mechanism would be community recovery. For instance/ this would enable the issuers of certificates to change the keys of your \"Certificate SBT\" after you have given your approval. Both methods are still subject to real-world experimentation. What Are the Drawbacks of SBTs? One of the main points of criticism is that SBTs could enable a dystopian future with new levels of surveillance. By tying an individual's record of employment or health to a token/ the parties with access to such information would hold enormous leverage over the entity the record belongs to. While SBTs are not supposed to be tied to the government/ their functionality could still be abused. Second/ recording and standardizing off-chain data sounds promising but it is likely difficult to connect to an on-chain record. Moreover/ the lack of a single standard of SBTs would inevitably lead to each blockchain issuing its own soulbound tokens in the same way that similar NFT collections pop up on different chains. Telling apart the \"true\" Soul would again rely on an off-chain social consensus instead of technologically verifiable uniqueness. Closing Thoughts Soulbound tokens originally come from the video game “World of Warcraft/” where some items are soulbound. Their on-chain application could help remedy several urgent Web3 trust and representation problems. As such/ they could rival the metaverse as the hot topic to spark the next cryptocurrency bull run.

An independent examiner is necessary here to investigate and report in a clear and understandable way on the Debtors' business model/ their operations/ their investments/ their lending transactions/ and the nature of the customer accounts to ensure public confidence in the integrity of the bankruptcy system and to neutralize the inherent distrust creditors and parties in interest have in the Debtors.\" For instance/ the filing acknowledges that Celsius took out a loan but stresses that \"no description of the types of claims\" by Celsius is provided/ including the lender or the collateral of the loan. Moreover/ the \"extreme financial irregularities\" in the bankruptcy case warrant \"the appointment of an independent and disinterested examiner in the best interests of creditors/ equity security holders/ and the bankruptcy estates.\" Such an investigation would also look into \"fraud/ dishonesty/ incompetence/ misconduct/ mismanagement/ or irregularity in the management of the affairs.\" A Twitter account created by (and for) unsecured Celsius creditors rebutted the need for such an independent examination/ saying it would incur costs at the wrong time: Celsius account holders can receive more information about the state of the bankruptcy case in the creditor committee’s newly-formulated FAQ: The request comes only days after news broke that Celsius would only have cash until the end of October before entering technical bankruptcy.

Commonly used to represent retirement plan benefits or pension plans/ \"vesting\" is used to convey the legal right to current or future payment/ asset or benefit/ typically from the employer. But for those familiar with traditional finance/ \"vesting\" has a slightly different meaning in the cryptocurrency space. In simpler terms/ vesting in crypto describes how tokens are released into circulation. And there’s a whole bunch of vernacular associated with the term that can be confusing to new and experienced investors alike. Let’s dive in and tackle everything you need to know about cryptocurrency vesting in 2022 and beyond. Here’s what this article will cover: Why projects have vesting schedules Who is subject to vesting and why How newly unlocked tokens affect the token supply And more! Subscribe Join us in showcasing the cryptocurrency revolution/ one newsletter at a time. Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox/ along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right/ millions love us!) — what are you waiting for? What Are Vesting Schedules? The supply of most new cryptocurrencies and tokens is generally influenced by so-called “vesting schedules” — that is/ the schedule by which previously created tokens are released into circulation. In most cases/ only a fraction of the maximum supply of possible tokens is circulating at a given time. The rest is usually vested or locked for another reason. Two main groups will usually be subject to vesting schedules; early investors and team members. Investors may be divided into one of several groups/ each of which may be subject to a different vesting period. The most common investor levels in token sales generally include (from earliest to latest participants): pre-seed/ seed/ private sale/ pre-sale/ and public sale (e.g. ICO/ IEO or IDO). Earlier participants generally enter at a more favorable price/ but are subject to a more stringent vesting schedule. This is demonstrated by the Solana allocation profile — which sold 15.9% of the initial supply to seed round investors at a rate of $0.04 per SOL/ whereas public sale participants bought 1.6% of the supply at $0.22 per SOL. Though seed participants got their SOL for cheaper/ they were also subject to a 9-month cliff period. It isn’t uncommon for projects to change their vesting schedule. The token sale agreements usually have provisions for this/ but it is rarely well-received by early investors. Team members and advisors/ on the other hand/ don’t usually pay for their tokens like investors/ but instead receive a free allocation that is subject to vesting. In most cases/ the team vesting schedule has the longest cliff and strictest vesting terms — with a one- to five-year divesting period commonplace. This ensures that the team remains motivated to maintain the associated platform or product behind their vested tokens while preventing undue selling pressure from team members cashing out their rewards. What Are Token Unlocks? Vesting schedules generally describe exactly when new tokens will enter circulation — typically relative to the token generation event (TGE)/ for instance every quarter after the TGE. When an unlock schedule has multiple rounds/ each round is known as a “tranche.” For example/ if a user expects to receive 1/000 tokens each month/ for 12 months post-TGE/ then each 1/000 token batch is known as a tranche. These unlocks may begin after a cliff period/ which is a delay before the vesting schedule kicks in. For example/ if a vested team member has a two-year cliff/ their token unlock schedule will not begin until two years have passed since TGE. In other cases/ tokens are unlocked linearly — sometimes following a cliff. This usually means that fractions can be claimed in proportion to the amount of time that has elapsed. In this case/ a vested participant subject to a 10-month linear vesting schedule would be able to claim 5% of their tokens when 5% of the time has elapsed/ or 20% when 20% of the time has elapsed/ etc. Oftentimes/ team and/or advisor token unlocks may be dependent on the project accomplishing specific goals or roadmap milestones/ such as listing on a reputable centralized exchange (CEX) or onboarding a certain number of users. If these are not met/ the tokens are not unlocked. What Are Vested Tokens? Until tokens are released or available to claim/ they are considered “vested.” These are the tokens that will eventually enter circulation/ but are still subject to a vesting schedule. In many cases/ a large fraction of the total supply can be considered vested. Once these tokens are unlocked for use/ they are considered “divested.” For instance/ looking at CoinMarketCap's Avalanche coin page/ we can see that the circulating supply and total supply has a difference of 119/299/447 AVAX coins. At launch/ a total of 360 million AVAX coins were minted and sold through private and public sales. The Avalanche seed sale/ private sale/ public sale option A1 and A2/ testnet incentive program had vesting periods of over a year to 18 months. Meanwhile/ strategic partners/ airdrop and team tokens had vesting periods of four years. The Avalanche Foundation’s token allocation has the lengthiest vesting period of 10 years. As these tokens divest/ they will enter the circulating supply. Why Do Projects Have Vesting Schedules? Today/ the vast majority of new cryptocurrencies and tokens have vesting schedules associated with them. This includes most projects that are privately funded (i.e. no seed/private/public sales). Vesting helps to ensure that the supply grows steadily over time/ ideally in line with increased demand/ helping to ensure stable and sustainable growth in value. It achieves this by ensuring that early investors/ team members and advisors cannot dump their tokens at a whim/ and potentially impact the long-term viability of the project. By controlling the rate at which the circulating supply grows/ projects can ensure the market capitalization (MCAP or market cap) grows in line with its utility and adoption. However/ it should be noted that a small number of projects use vesting schedules to create an artificially low circulating supply and inflate the valuation of the project. These projects often have extremely high inflation/ which generally impacts later investors. How Does Token Vesting Impact the Token Supply? In short/ token vesting leads to an increase in the circulating supply of a tokens (where the circulating supply is all the tokens currently in the market that can be moved/ sold/ traded/ used/ etc./ without restrictions.) That said/ token vesting should not be confused with token inflation — the process that sees the total supply of a token increase alongside an increase in circulating supply. Token vesting only changes the circulating supply. In many cases/ just a tiny fraction of the maximum supply is unlocked for circulation at the TGE. In some cases/ the initial supply can be less than 1% of the total supply/ which means token vesting can lead to a dramatic increase in the token supply over the vesting period. As you might expect/ when increased supply is not met with increased demand/ this can lead to a reduction in the value of the token. That said/ some newer vesting schedules also include burn mechanics which allow investors to burn part of their vested tokens in order to receive additional tokens right away. DAO Maker’s toll bridge system is one example of this. How Do You Calculate the Circulating Supply? The circulating supply is one of the most important metrics surrounding a cryptocurrency/ since it can/ in many cases/ help you decide whether a coin is overvalued or undervalued (relative to its market capitalization). Unfortunately/ calculating the circulating supply of a cryptocurrency isn’t always straightforward — since it requires knowledge of the full tokenomics of a project. At CoinMarketCap/ we communicate with the team behind most of the cryptocurrencies we track to establish the circulating supply through our listings process. If known and verified/ this figure is displayed on the relevant coin detail page. Read our glossary entry for a breakdown of what tokenomics means. In the vast majority of cases/ cryptocurrencies can be considered inflationary since their circulating supply increases over time. A far smaller number is deflationary/ which means their circulating supply shrinks with time — mostly due to tokens being burned for one or more reasons.

A central bank digital currency is an electronic version of the fiat currency in a given nation/ meaning it is the same as the paper currency issued by governments. It can take a variety of forms/ but the vast majority uses blockchain technology to some extent. CBDCs are liable to central banks/ and they are supposed to be redeemable for equivalent amounts of the physical money. Over 90% of central banks are currently in the process of creating CBDCs or considering a local digital currency. Yet/ while almost all of the world’s largest countries are currently exploring CBDCs/ very few have made it yet past the early stages. The one exception has been China/ whose digital yuan has seen limited releases in select regions. At least so far/ it appears to be the developing world that is most interested in CBDCs. This may be due to their potential use for digital payments/ low-fee cross-border transactions and remittances/ as well as disintermediation from banks and other traditional financial institutions. What Is Nigeria’s eNaira? The eNaira is a non-interest bearing CBDC that maintains parity with the Naira. Designed by Bitt Inc./ it runs on the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain — which is private and permissioned — under the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). This means that the eNaira runs on an intermediated architecture rather than on a public blockchain. The CBDC has a tiered anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) system/ which requires only a national ID-linked phone number at the lowest level/ but limits transactions every day to roughly $120. The CBDC was created in response to the following problems that have plagued the country in recent years: Fleeing fiat: The value of the Naira — the paper currency — has fallen dramatically over the last half decade. This has led many young Nigerians to store their savings in cryptocurrencies/ which the government sees as draining liquidity from the banking system. A total of 33.4 million Nigerians used crypto over the six months leading up to April 2021/ according to exchange KuCoin. In February 2021/ the CBN banned banks from working with cryptocurrency exchanges/ bringing criticism from international organizations/ including the United Nations/ for arbitrarily penalizing young Africans in the tech sector. Remittances and fees: Nigeria has a large diaspora spread around the world/ and many of these Nigerians abroad regularly send money to relatives in the country. In 2019/ remittance receipts totaled about $24 million/ according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Since this money is typically sent through services like Western Union/ the fees can range from 1-5%. The eNaira is supposed to dramatically reduce these costs for remittances/ while at the same time/ it will reduce costs associated with digital payments inside the country. Financial inclusion: Nigeria has long struggled with a lack of access to banking and financial services. A total of 38 million people/ or 36% of the population/ do not have bank accounts/ per IMF data. At least in theory/ the eNaira is now available to anyone with a mobile phone/ helping the situation of the unbanked as well as aiding social transfer programs. Progress of the eNaira At the time of the eNaira’s launch in October 2021/ the governor of the CBN said that $500 million eNaira ($1.21 million) had been minted. In the first phase of the launch/ it was necessary to have a bank account to use the CBDC/ though further phases have been geared towards bringing in the unbanked. In May 2022/ the government launched an upgrade to its wallet app that made it easier to transact in Naira/ allowing for the payment of electric bills and other utilities as well as various goods and services/ including airline tickets. Then/ one month later/ the government made the eNaira available on phones through unstructured supplementary service data (USSD)/ which has a similar mode of operation to SMS. This has boosted the amount of people who can potentially access the eNaira to about 100 million. The next step will be to launch the USSD codes/ giving access to even those without smartphones. Despite these moves/ the government has struggled to get people to actually use the CBDC. In the seven months following its launch/ less than 800/000 people downloaded the eNaira’s wallet app. Less than 100 retailers in the country are currently accepting the eNaira as payment as of time of writing/ according to an article from Nigerian media in May 2022. Nevertheless/ the government continues to push on with the implementation of the CBDC/ with recent promotional activities held at major markets in the capital Lagos. How Can You Buy eNaira? Getting started using the eNaira is a simple process for Nigerian citizens. The first step is to download the eNaira Speed Wallet and then go through the KYC requirements for whichever selected tier — a choice that will impact the daily transaction limit. There are several options for funding the wallet. The simplest way is to log into your bank app and transfer funds to Speed Wallet/ but it’s also possible to visit a bank or speak with an eNaira verification agent if you wish to deposit cash into the wallet. For those overseas wishing to send funds to Nigeria/ foreign exchange can be converted into eNaira through an international money transfer operator (IMTO) such as HSBC and then sent to an IMTO eNaira wallet. From there/ it can be sent to other wallets in the country. Conclusion While the road has been rocky so far/ the rollout of the eNaira can’t help but trudge along/ with the government pushing more and more initiatives to boost inclusion and entice users. As this is the world’s first CBDC/ it seems fair to cut the Nigerian government a little bit of slack in their lackluster implementation. With a little time and elbow grease/ the project may find itself a success in its home country and a successful model to follow abroad.

Unlike a normal wallet which may hold wads of cash/ a crypto wallet does not technically store your crypto assets. Instead/ the assets live on the blockchain/ and can only be accessed using your private keys that are stored on the wallet. Crypto wallets can be custodial or non-custodial — both store your private keys/ proving the ownership of your digital assets. Your keys allow you to sign transactions/ transfer cryptocurrencies and interact with smart contracts. However/ losing your private keys means that you also lose access to your crypto holdings. Therefore/ it is imperative that you understand how crypto wallets work/ and how to keep your keys secure. Read on to find out more. Types of Wallets There are two main umbrellas of wallets: Hardware wallets Software wallets Furthermore/ each crypto wallet includes two important components. Public key Private key Public and Private Crypto Wallet Keys A public key is the public-facing address of your wallet. You can think of public keys like your home address — you use it when you want something delivered to your place. In crypto terms/ the keys serve the purpose of receiving inbound cryptocurrencies and handle the encryption of outbound transaction data. While depositing cryptocurrency to a wallet/ a public key is required to be entered as the deposit address. Meanwhile/ a private key is akin to the password used to access your digital assets. It also proves ownership over those assets stored in the wallet/ and is used to transfer cryptocurrencies out of the wallet. An important thing to note: your private key should not be shared with anyone. Anyone with control holds ownership over that wallet and can move the assets inside that particular wallet as he wishes. One too many crypto hacks have occured due to crypto users being duped to share their private keys. Custodial Crypto Wallets Various wallet services offered by centralized entities/ like a centralized exchange (CEX)/ are known as custodial wallets. These wallets come with certain benefits attached to them/ such as less user responsibility as compared to managing your own wallets. Outsourcing your wallet custody means that you are giving away access to your own set of private keys. In short/ the user is not responsible for protecting their private key to their wallet/ as they already have placed their trust in a business into keeping their assets safe. However/ many CEXs also offer non-custodial wallet solutions/ such as Binance Chain Wallet/ Coinbase Wallet and Crypto.com DeFi Wallet. How Do Custodial Wallets Work? In order to make a successful transaction through a custodial wallet/ the user is required to log in to the platform with their username and password and then enter the public key of the location where they wish to make the transfer. After that/ the business takes over and is directly responsible for making the transaction on their own as the funds are stored on the wallets that they own. Pros of Custodial Wallets As mentioned/ the private access keys are not your responsibility. You do not need to worry about forgetting your key/ and even if you misplace your password/ you can always request that the CEX or wallet provider recovers your account. Some businesses that offer these custodial wallet services also offer a backup option. Backups enable users to undo transactions or restore a previous version as every step is recorded and backed up to the company’s server. Cons of Custodial Wallets While it may be a simpler option/ users need to note that they are exposed to the risk of exploitation or hacks that the wallet provider might suffer. There have been several hacking cases/ including loss of funds held in custody. While not exactly a wallet provider/ another risk — which became evident in the recent downturn — is the possibility of having your funds locked up. Many who deposited money/ some their life savings/ into custodial accounts on Celsius or Voyager were unable to withdraw after the companies declared bankruptcy. Furthermore/ certain governments have completely banned the use of custodial wallets for completing transactions for users in certain areas. In times of political unrest/ this means that governments have more power to restrict movement of funds in custodial wallets. For example/ during the Canadian trucker protest in early 2022/ the government ordered a freeze on the crypto assets of the protestors held in custodial wallets. Another drawback of a custodial wallet is that users are usually required to perform KYC (Know Your Customer) verification: for most custodial wallets/ users are not allowed to access any features or assets without proving their identity. Non-Custodial Wallets As most of you have already guessed/ non-custodial wallets do not require any sort of third-party involvement like custodial wallets do. They don't outsource to any institution/ so as a result/ no institution can refuse to complete transactions. A user has total control over their own private keys: none of their transactions have to go through centralized third-parties. Pros of Non-Custodial Wallets Non-custodial wallets serve the purpose of ensuring the confidentiality of a user's assets. However/ that comes with the responsibility of storing your private keys/ which are the sole way of accessing your account. Unlike custodial wallets/ users can easily access their stored funds in any situation and without KYC/ as there is no need for a confirmation notice from any third party. Instant withdrawals are available in non-custodial wallets/ while some CEXs require a certain time to process transactions. Cons of a Non-Custodial Wallet Security is a big concern when it comes to non-custodial wallets. As you are in complete control of your own private keys/ your funds are gone forever if those keys are lost or stolen. Case in point: the man who lost his hard drive containing 7.500 BTC/ worth over $185 million at the time of writing. It's important to take measures to ensure the safety of your private keys. Because/ as secure as it may be/ even the owner of the wallet himself can't access their wallet if the private key is misplaced or lost. Unlike custodial wallets/ non-custodial wallets aren't often particularly user-friendly. Beginners may have a steeper learning curve and require some time before getting to know how to use these wallets. When it comes to non-custodial wallets/ the recovery of funds is a bit more complicated and in some extreme cases even impossible/ which is why it is important to be extra careful when using them. In the event that you do lose access to your non-custodial wallet/ the first thing you should do is reach out to the wallet's support team. If the wallet's support team is unable to help you/ you can try reaching out to the blockchain's support team. And if all else fails/ you can try contacting the exchanges where you purchased your cryptocurrency.

A quick search on Google trends shows exactly just that. Source The idea of Web3/ which refers to a new version of the onternet made possible by distributed ledgers/ artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies/ was coined by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood — also founder of Polkadot — who spoke of a “decentralized online ecosystem based on blockchain.” However/ for such a relevant concept/ trying to understand Web3 can be rather exasperating. It can feel at times like an overly loose structure of an idea/ with people piling in anything from cryptocurrencies to decentralized social networks. OdysseyDAO has tried to take the initiative to explain some of these tricky intricacies to the public/ hoping to help smoothly transition regular people and techies alike into the new internet era. What Is OdysseyDAO? OdysseyDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) focused on onboarding people into Web3 by providing free courses and articles of high quality. Odyssey describes itself as a “learning DAO/” with an intense focus in the area of tech education. The project/ which started out as a beginner's guide to crypto by Peter Yang/ has become a community effort to provide the best online education about Web3. Yang/ who also works as a product lead at Reddit/ heads up content creation for Odyssey and has experience writing the “Creator Economy” newsletter. Objectives of OdysseyDAO As a tech concept of growing significance/ there is an urgent need for people to better understand Web3 than they currently do. However/ mainstream media outlets have inadequately educated the public on the subject/ with much of the conversation beginning and ending around the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies or the high energy costs associated with proof-of-work Bitcoin mining. Sometimes it may seem like the only people who are interested in Web3 on a deeper level have a programming background. OdysseyDAO looks to solve this knowledge gap between the public and experts by creating structured guides with concise/ easy-to-understand articles on various topics related to Web3. Odyssey describes them as ELI5 guides/ which stands for “explain like I’m five years old.” The short guides to subjects like non-fungible tokens (NFTs)/ decentralized finance (DeFi)/ DAO and Web3 are simply written/ elegantly formatted/ and visually appealing graphics. With more people looking to enter the crypto industry than ever before/ OdysseyDAO/ which started with a community of 1/800 people/ is now trying to onboard the next 1 million into the Web3 space/ according to the founders. The community is primarily centered around Twitter and Discord. Web3 and OdysseyDAO The new decentralized web that is currently being rolled out uses AI-powered search algorithms/ virtual reality (VR)/ augmented reality (AR)/ as well as enhanced data analytics to take the internet into its next phase. On top of trying to help the public catch up with the pace of change in the digital domain/ another goal of OdysseyDAO is to prepare people to enter the Web3 space. Odyssey lists jobs from companies and grants better access to users who have completed their courses. In addition/ Odyssey gives its contributors shared ownership. The subjects covered by group courses include the following: Intro to Web3: This course teaches how to buy cryptocurrencies and set up a wallet. NFTs: This course explains the process involved in how to buy/ sell/ and mint NFTs. DAO’s: This course shows users how they can build decentralized communities of their own. DeFi: This course instructs people on how to save/ borrow/ and invest crypto assets with DeFi protocols. Breaking Into Web3: This course serves as a more detailed guide to Web3 than the intro course In addition to providing information on various Web3 topics/ Odyssey continues to build its community by organizing virtual and IRL hangouts/ workshops and community discussions with experts. The organization also offers a Web3 rewards program where participants get incentives for completing tasks assigned by the DAO. How Is OdysseyDAO Funded? At an early stage of the project/ Odyssey announced that it would raise 25 ETH to create quality learning paths for anyone looking to learn about and work in Web3. OdysseyDAO hit and surpassed its fundraising target/ receiving 32.46 ETH. The DAO was able to achieve this by offering limited edition NFTs and governance tokens (ODY) during its crowdfunding. To become a backer of Odyssey/ people were asked to buy one of three NFT collections created with the Wanderers team: Voyager: 100 NFT artworks in the collection/ each priced at 0.1 ETH. Voyagers were given 100 ODY. The entire collection sold out. Discovery: 30 NFT artworks in the collection/ each priced at 0.25 ETH. Discoverers were given 250 ODY. The entire collection sold out. Genesis: 15 NFT artworks in the collection/ each priced at 1 ETH. Holders were given 1/000 ODY/ with 9 out of 15 artworks successfully sold. Top backers were given an extra special 1/1 NFT created by artist Motionscape. Running the Project Odyssey has acknowledged that creating a DAO is far easier than ensuring its continuity. As such/ they have put measures in place to ensure that the project is funded as it seeks to continue its mission. According to the OdysseyDAO's tokenomics/ 80% of the funds raised are to be placed in the community treasury. The funds set aside are to be used to pay the team leads and community members who make significant contributions to the project. Members of the OdysseyDAO Discord community can choose to publicly identify as investors in the project. Governance of OdysseyDAO DAOs are built to ensure trustless decision-making. Like other groups of its kind/ OdysseyDAO has put in place frameworks intended to help make governance accessible to everyone/ rather than a select few. To ensure the long-term continuity of the project/ Odyssey launched the ODY token/ which allocates governance responsibility to all its holders. Currently/ there are 178 backers of OdysseyDAO. Backers of the project who receive the ODY tokens can use them to submit and vote on the proposals that Odyssey is supposed to tackle next. In addition/ all backers were invited to a private Discord channel where governance decisions are debated. The ODY tokens were issued during the crowdfunding/ with none leftover for new members. The only way to obtain them now would be to purchase them from the original backers and have the governance rights transferred.

What the heck is/ in fact/ a commodity/ and why would BTC be one/ but ETH isn’t one? In this article/ we cover: What is a commodity/ and what is a security? Are BTC and ETH commodities/ and how are they different? The implications of the rise of digital commodities Subscribe Join us in showcasing the cryptocurrency revolution/ one newsletter at a time. Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox/ along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right/ millions love us!) — what are you waiting for? What Are Commodities? Wikipedia defines commodities as follows: A commodity is an economic good/ usually a resource/ that has full or substantial fungibility: that is/ the market treats instances of the good as equivalent or nearly so with no regard to who produced them. Full fungibility means one unit equals one unit. For instance/ fiat currencies like USD have full fungibility since bills are identical (apart from their serial number). Cryptocurrencies/ whether tokens or coins/ are also fully fungible. One Bitcoin is the same as the next Bitcoin. Some definitions imply that commodities are used for production or consumption — this can be true/ but it’s not a hard and fast rule. For instance/ oil is used to produce other goods. Gold/ however/ is often used in its (almost) original form as a store of value and does not produce anything. Furthermore/ commodities do not necessarily have to be physical. Storage space in the cloud is a digital commodity. Electricity is a commodity without a physical appearance. Commodities can be assets/ and vice versa. For example/ real estate is an asset but not a commodity. Fiat currency is both an asset and a commodity. Commodities are often not perfectly fungible. Crude oil/ often referenced as the prototypical commodity/ has different benchmarks. Oil can be heavy or light and sweet or sour/ which refers to its density and sulfur content. This basically influences how easy it is to process and influences its price. Another way of differentiation of commodities can be their production process. Salt/ another stereotypical commodity that is virtually indistinguishable in taste/ can be extracted in different ways. Some consumers also care about how sustainable the production process is/ influencing the commodity's price. Thus/ virtually no commodity does not also exist as a product with a marked-up value. Both are commodities but with vastly differing use cases. What Is a Security? The United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934 defines a security as a fungible financial instrument that represents an ownership position and is used to raise capital in the form of equity (stocks)/ debt (bonds)/ or a combination of both. Before the rise of cryptocurrencies/ a security could not be a commodity. Securities are tradable financial assets. For instance/ stocks are equity securities and bonds are debt securities. A derivative — like a futures contract of a commodity — is also a security. However/ a commodity itself could not be a security/ because there is no issuer. The invention of cryptocurrencies has raised the very thorny question of whether a cryptocurrency can be a security and a commodity/ or just one or the other. Failing or passing the Howey Test often pops up concerning cryptocurrencies. This test establishes whether a transaction qualifies as an \"investment contract\" and is thus considered a security subject to registration requirements under U.S. laws. According to the Howey Test/ a security is: An investment of money; In a common enterprise; With the expectation of profit; To be derived from the efforts of others. For example/ launching a company and issuing stocks fails the Howey Test/ because buying stocks is a transaction with the expectation of profit derived from the efforts of the company's employees. Are Bitcoin and Ether Commodities? To answer this question/ we have to understand what BTC and ETH do. One Bitcoin (or one Ether) is the representation of blockspace on the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. The use case of blockspace on the Bitcoin blockchain is mostly storing and sending value/ i.e./ money. The network's users buy coins to transact value in a decentralized and censorship-resistant way/ or to store value in the hope that the blockspace becomes more expensive. On the Ethereum blockchain/ users can also transact value. However/ Ethereum is more frequently used to execute smart contracts on the blockchain. These deterministic functions allow us to build applications that use Ethereum's decentralized blockspace as an \"operating system.\" Hence/ Ethereum is pitched as a decentralized world computer. Note that Ether (the cryptocurrency) could be a commodity/ but not Ethereum (the network). Sometimes/ BTC is referred to as digital gold and ETH as digital oil. This analogy is broadly correct/ as ETH is \"consumed as fuel\" to execute smart contracts that make up decentralized applications. In short/ yes/ BTC and ETH are digital commodities. However/ if blockspace in and of itself is a digital commodity/ then all blockchains are commodities. This is where we need to make a further distinction between commodities and securities. Are Bitcoin and Ether Securities? To answer this question/ we have to understand the difference between public and private goods: A public good belongs to nobody and can be used by anybody (e.g. air). A private good is limited in its availability to its owners and whom they give access (private roads). A rivalrous private good is when the consumption of the good by one person prevents the ability of others to consume it. By that definition/ the Bitcoin network is a rivalrous public good. The network belongs to nobody/ and there is no centralized control over it. However/ the more people use its blockspace/ the higher transaction fees become. The Ethereum network is currently also a rivalrous public good. However/ some fear that its switch to proof-of-stake could make it more similar to a private good/ where addresses can get censored. The biggest validator nodes will belong to institutional players like centralized exchanges: if this remains the case/ they could accumulate more ETH through staking rewards/ which introduces a centralization risk to Ethereum. Bitcoin passes the Howey Test since/ at its inception/ there was no expectation of profit and no counterparty to be relied on to make an effort to attain Bitcoins. In other words/ owning BTC does not mean one owns the network. Ethereum’s case is not as clear-cut. This is mainly because ETH was sold to raise money to bootstrap the Ethereum network. That also implies/ at least initially/ a reliance on the effort of the Ethereum Foundation to get the network off the ground. Moreover/ you could argue that the upcoming switch to proof-of-stake implies a literal stake in the network (akin to equity). However/ it is usually argued that Ethereum is nowadays so decentralized that it does not qualify as a security (anymore). On the other hand/ other blockchains would be much more likely to be considered securities because of their centralization. Ethereum is commonly considered the most decentralized smart contract-oriented blockchain. Other chains rely to a much greater degree on a centralized team to drive their development (and thus their profitability). Token launches are practically always securities. That is why most white papers explicitly state that there is no expectation of profit for a virtually worthless governance token. The Implications of Digital Commodities The obvious question is: BTC and ETH are digital commodities. So what? This perception has implications for their trading behavior. Cryptocurrencies are currently considered a highly speculative and risky asset class (which is fair enough). However/ if their perception changes to being (scarce) digital commodities/ this will influence their price and trading behavior. For example/ Bitcoin is expected to become less volatile in the long run. Depending on the network's adoption rate (demand-side push) and scaling solutions like the Lightning Network (supply-side push)/ Bitcoin could become (speculative) digital gold. Lightning Network growth/ Source: Bitcoin Visuals Etherum is more akin to hypergrowth high-risk equity in the blockchain industry. It boasts a highly experimental product as a \"decentralized operating system\" and does not have its use cases entirely figured out. However/ the potential range is massive/ from gaming to the tokenization and financialization of entire industries. Its success will depend on the success of the Merge and the successful adoption of scaling solutions like Optimism/ Arbitrum/ zkSync and Starkware. Although Ethereum could still be declared a security/ that is very unlikely. An entire industry has largely developed on the back of trading these two cryptocurrencies/ and these powerful interest groups do not have an interest in changing the status quo. The longer ETH is not declared a security/ the more likely it is that things will remain as they are. Conclusion Bitcoin and Ether are commodities/ since they provide a highly sought-after digital commodity in blockspace. The same cannot be said for most other cryptocurrencies. Whether the market eventually agrees with this perception remains to be seen. This article contains links to third-party websites or other content for information purposes only (“Third-Party Sites”).

Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox/ along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right/ millions love us!) — what are you waiting for? A SWOT Analysis Of Tokenization The biggest innovation of cryptocurrencies — beyond decentralized P2P payments — is the tokenization of digital and real-world assets. Fungible tokens enable you to trade any asset without friction. Non-fungible tokens can represent real or digital scarcity on the blockchain. Traditional tech startups usually build following this route: Market research → Product design → User acquisition → Monetization But crypto companies/ with tokens as their main monetization mechanism/ flip the script: User acquisition → Monetization → Market research → Product design Just think about the countless play-to-earn games that only offer a barely functional alpha version (at best) but already sell \"digital assets\" (NFTs) and have a traded token. Tascha/ who holds a PhD in macroeconomics and is an expert at the crypto/macro intersection/ calls this effect the \"truth and bullsh*t of Web3.\" The threats of tokenization are: The Exploitation of FOMO Culture Through Buzzwords and Busywork Many metaverse white papers read like a potpourri of our glossary. The more buzzwords/ the merrier! You'll be able to do such amazing things in our super-scarce virtual land! Just make sure to buy the token first… Many metaverse tokens do exactly what they are designed to do: make the insiders money and go to zero. Equally bad are blockchain games that pretend clicking buttons every day for a minute is fun gameplay and economically sustainable. Not far behind is many a yield farm that bribes users with virtually worthless governance tokens to provide liquidity. Ponzinomics We all know most of it is a scam/ but we go along with it as long as the music is playing. The collapse of Terra should have convinced even the most optimistic crypto Ponzi connoisseurs: no token is too big to fail if the tokenomics are unsustainable. It's just a matter of time. Tascha provides a simple rule of thumb: What’s left in this product/project if you take the token away? Because many crypto companies start from a token-first perspective/ they receive little market feedback/ and users are left with poor UX and sometimes an empty wallet. Decentralization for the Sake of Decentralization A decentralized Twitter would be cool and useful. But all too often/ particularly in the GameFi space/ decentralization is the entire value pitch. Would a game like Grand Theft Auto V/ which has grossed over $6 billion/ need to be decentralized? Decentralization and tokenization can add value/ but they should not be the main value pitch. But tokenization also provides a lot of opportunities: Aligning Incentives Tokenization can nudge and reward good behavior. Look at move-to-earn tokens/ which were the hottest thing in crypto for a while. The idea/ in principle/ is laudable: people don't get enough exercise/ so let's reward them for working out. In economic terms/ exercise is a positive externality/ and move-to-earn projects lets users capture its value of exercise by rewarding them with tokens. If more DApps rewarded positive externalities (like fitness)/ cryptocurrencies would develop a new use case. And let's be honest: working out is much easier when you get paid for it. Equity for Everyone Crypto companies rightfully often take the flak for having excessive insider allocations. But many still have a much fairer share of ownership than classic startups. Astute investors/ who are prepared to sift through the mud to find a few token gems with real use cases and solid roadmaps/ still get a better deal than with startups. Especially considering that you can directly influence the development of a protocol by being involved. Rewarding Contributors At its core/ tokenized companies are the most democratic governance model. DAOs are sometimes too democratic and paralyzed by too many people having a say in them. But only in crypto can you find a promising project early/ contribute to its development and be directly rewarded if it's successful. Web3 Use Cases Today When you're bullish on crypto as financial and technological innovation/ it's easy to overlook the fact that not everyone shares that optimistic outlook: Web3 naysayers like Diehl cite computational and logistical problems as reasons why crypto-based technology is bullsh*t. They're not entirely wrong either. The truth is that cryptocurrencies are a technological and financial innovation/ at least on the scale they have now broken through. Problematic as they may be/ that innovation can mature and improve — if only we knew what to focus on. Is crypto primarily better money? Or are blockchains the backbone of a more egalitarian internet? Because of this ambiguity/ several non-overlapping use cases have developed. Though critics like Stephen Diehl will dismiss those as scams/ the economic demand is there — for better or worse. Digital Collectibles The only real use case of NFTs thus far that has seen widespread adoption are artificially scarce JPEGs. Call that a scam or a Ponzi all day/ but people are trading them. Speculation can be a use case in itself. (Decentralized) Exchanges DEXes are another speculation-related use case. They do allow permissionless trading of financial assets/ but only the most stone-faced crypto enthusiasts can maintain that these create real economic value. In principle/ decentralized exchanges could allow those locked out of traditional financial markets to acquire equity. But in practice/ they just allow speculation on the circular crypto economy. Decentralized Finance DeFi largely overlaps with DEXes/ since it provides only more infrastructure facilitating speculation/ such as overcollateralized lending. Some DeFi protocols try to connect the crypto economy with the real-world economy. For instance/ Goldfinch provides crypto loans to emerging markets. Teller Finance supports USDC for crypto-backed mortgages in Texas. Still largely a bet on the future/ DeFi is at least attempting to create real-world value. Stablecoins Stablecoins are probably the biggest and most tangible use case in Web3. They reduce friction when settling payments and could upend the existing banking infrastructure. Some argue that centralized stablecoins like USDC are not real cryptocurrencies. But that may be the reason why established financial institutions like BlackRock back them. Decentralized Talent Hiring & Decentralized File Storage Companies like Braintrust successfully leverage blockchain technology to create more efficient versions of existing hiring platforms like Upwork. On the other hand/ decentralized file storage has not taken off as much as was hoped for/ though it remains a fringe use case of blockchain tech. Web3 Use Cases in 2025 Let's respawn three years from now. The world is in a much better place/ inflation has subsided/ supply chains are back to normal and geopolitical tensions have eased. The economy is growing on hopes that tech will save the day/ and blockchains have made big strides toward scaling. Which use cases could scale blockchain’s power? ReFi ReFi is the latest buzzword and is short for Regenerative Finance. In short/ it encapsulates the idea of cryptocurrencies used \"for good causes/\" like putting a price on carbon emissions. The crypto industry has already dabbled with putting a price on negative externalities and rewarding positive ones (remember move-to earn?). Scaled chains would reduce the friction of trading these externalities and level the playing field. Nowadays/ these markets are either hard to access for outsiders or don't exist at all — say/ a diet-to-earn market. Imagine a 100X times bigger and more efficient version of Klima DAO (the protocol buying carbon emissions certificates with protocol-owned liquidity). Metaverse (powered by VR/AR) Source: H-Blogger This is a contentious one but only because the metaverse has been abused as a buzzword thus far. The data says that time spent online is only going up. The more attention we dedicate to online activities/ the more money goes towards keeping us there. Tech giants keep pushing out VR/AR innovation/ which is simply a way of making time spent online more fun. This is where the metaverse comes in. The metaverse could be thought of as the next iteration of online communities/ which went from forums to social media/ and now seem to be going towards the metaverse. Private Telegram groups and Discord servers could be upgraded to becoming token-gated communities with engaging virtual worlds. You could argue these would be better built on centralized platforms/ but that is a problem that the metaverse will have to figure out. Web3 Social Media Even though the Musk takeover of Twitter fell through — and with it a possible blockchainization of the platform — social media is ripe for innovation. Disruption could easily start at the low end of the market by targeting those already eager to jump ship from centralized social media (like all of Crypto Twitter). If platforms prove to be sound products/ it would not take much for normies to give them a shot. The blueprint is already out there: Social media monetizes user data/ but almost all of the revenue goes to platform owners (tech companies). Scaled blockchains can disrupt that ownership model and/ with it/ change the way we interact online. Gaming The gaming market is massive/ and/ in principle/ decentralization has utility. Today's games already have ownership aspects/ although financialization stays behind the walled garden of the game itself. Scaled blockchains could help put the in-game economies (though likely not the games themselves) on crypto payment rails. Think FIFA Ultimate Team/ but you actually own your team. However/ gaming communities have thus far been largely hostile to crypto: how much that will change remains to be seen. Decentralized Science DeSci is still an overlooked part of Web3/ but decentralized science could improve existing structures in several ways: Communication: provide more subject-driven and real-time communication compared to social media/email. Publishing: streamline the time spent in peer review. Financing: help overcome the \"valley of death\" between innovation and development. Scaled blockchains would mainly facilitate coordination and cooperation in the form of DAOs. We cover decentralized science in more detail in this video: Zero-Knowledge Proofs The ZK-proof technology already exists/ so it’s not a question of when we’ll use them/ but to what extent we’ll use them. ZK-proofs allow sharing data without compromising privacy/ and their application at scale would be a big step toward improving DeFi. For instance/ on-chain credit scores and integrating off-chain data will benefit from the privacy and scale of ZK-proofs. Soulbound Tokens This is an idea popularized by Vitalik Buterin in a blog post. In essence/ soulbound tokens would allow the identification of people on-chain and would be non-transferable tokens confirming their owner's identity. Their use cases are still undefined/ but one possible application would be more equal on-chain governance mechanisms than the quite inegalitarian models today. Soulbound tokens would allow a true one person:one vote mechanism instead of centralizing power like in proof-of-stake mechanisms. Another example could be token-gated communities like the metaverse mentioned above. Soulbound tokens could also be used as a registry of your medical/financial/legal record or even merely for loyalty programs. They’re in essence your unique virtual identifier and use cases could be utopian or dystopian. Conclusion Although crypto critics have a fair point that today's crypto economy is largely circular and speculation-based/ this doesn't need to be the case in 2025. In fact/ none of the described use cases are related to speculation/ which already makes one thing crystal clear. If crypto and Web3 are to evolve/ the next bull run will be driven by more than just gambling on s***coins.

The Singapore-based fund/ worth an estimated $18 billion in assets under management (AUM) at its peak/ has also been reprimanded by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) after giving false information and managing more AUM than it was allowed. After the news broke of the fund's insolvency/ media covered the apparent abandonment of its offices and reports that its founders were missing — a move that is not that surprising in the crypto world anymore (um/ Ruja Ignatova from the OneCoin scam anyone?) It turns out the founders were laying low/ speaking with lawyers and ultimately heading to Dubai — where they had initially planned to move HQ — according to an exclusive interview with Bloomberg. But hold on/ how did this all happen? The downfall of 3AC caught many in the crypto circle by surprise — founders Zhu Su and Kyle Davies were hailed as some of the smartest in the space/ with many loyal followers taking their words/ or tweets in this case/ as sage advice. But in a mash-up of poor risk management/ leverage and bad investment calls in Terra (read: the full breakdown of the Terra crash)/ stETH and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) — 3AC's story eventually spiralled into a series of liquidations/ margin calls and ultimately — bankruptcy. In this article/ we attempt to break down/ while understanding the basic financial concepts in play/ what really happened to the crypto fund. We also explore what ripple effects it had on the wider crypto industry. Beind the Founders of 3AC Before we dive in/ a quick primer on how 3AC came about. Zhu and Davies were childhood friends since high school/ as well as both Columbia University graduates. After starting out their careers during the 2008 global financial crisis on the trading desks of various investment banks/ and a stint as traders at Credit Suisse/ the pair left the firm in 2012 to found 3AC. Initially focused on emerging-market foreign exchanges/ the pair then chanced upon cryptocurrencies. Like most of us here/ the two were sold on crypto’s potential/ and the fund became crypto-exclusive by 2018. While the fund began with a focus on derivatives trading in Bitcoin and Ethereum/ the fund diversified over the years into venture capital/ betting big and oftentimes successfully. Zhu hailed the fund’s investments in Deribit (the options exchange in crypto) along with investments in Layer 1s like Avalanche/ Solana and Polkadot during the bear market as some of their best bets. As a result/ the fund’s AUM grew exponentially/ reaching an estimated $18 billion at its peak. 3AC was one of the first funds to invest in emerging projects like Aave back in the DeFi summer of 2020. However/ it was one of the investments that they made during DeFi summer that caught everyone’s attention — $200 million worth of shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). The trade would later contribute to the fund’s downfall. Let’s explore it more. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust Grayscale is one of the world’s first digital currency asset managers. It offers the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust/ at that time one of the first few US-regulated institutional products for large players to gain exposure to Bitcoin. Simply put/ instead of buying the native asset and storing it/ institutions are able to purchase a product that tracks the underlying asset (in this case/ Bitcoin). So why did 3AC buy up so many GBTC shares/ eventually becoming the largest holders of GBTC? The reason was simple: for years after GBTC launched/ it traded at a premium (i.e. above its net asset value)/ as it was the one of the few that offered Bitcoin exposure to institutions. This premium meant that a share of GBTC was trading higher than the value of Bitcoin backing it. Grayscale allows firms like 3AC to buy shares directly in exchange for Bitcoin. What this also means is it creates an arbitrage opportunity — 3AC can then sell the shares (at a premium) to investors on the market. 3AC accumulated 6.26% of the total shares of GBTC in mid-2020. However/ there’s a catch: GBTC shares have a lock-up period of 6 months. As more firms entered the so-called “GBTC arbitrage trade/” and competition in the form of crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) products from the likes of VanEck/ Proshares and Valkyrie hit the market/ the premium for GBTC soon flipped into a discount. To close the widening discount/ Grayscale has filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to convert the Bitcoin Trust to an ETF structure. However/ the discount widened as the SEC continuously rejected Grayscale’s attempt to convert the GBTC investment vehicle to an ETF structure — the latest rejection coming on June 29/ 2022. It was also reported that days before 3AC melted down/ it pitched an GBTC arbitrage trade to raise funds before the June SEC decision on its ETF filing/ probably in a last-ditch attempt to save the fund. Accumulating Ethereum and Investing in Terra In November 2021/ at the peak of the bull run/ Zhu tweeted that he was abandoning Ethereum “despite supporting it in the past”. But as it turned out/ the fund made a purchase of about $400M worth of Ethereum in December 2021. According to some/ this was typical “psyops” or mind games that Zhu was engaging in — telling the masses one thing/ but doing another. e How was this relevant? Zhu constantly tweeted about the crypto “supercycle” thesis after the market started dipping post-November 2021. He essentially believed that it was just a dip in the continuation of the bull market. Unsurprisingly/ some were sceptical about it being “psyops.\" It turns out that he was backing his words — the fund had many long positions open/ a major one being Terra. A major reason was the close personal relationship between the 3AC founders and Terra’s founder Do Kwon after he moved to Singapore. However/ despire this friendship/ 3AC founders were still caught by surprise at the speed of the fall of the algorithmic stablecoin UST and Terra. Speaking to Bloomberg/ Zhu said: “What we failed to realize was that Luna was capable of falling to effective zero in a matter of days and that this would catalyze a credit squeeze across the industry that would put significant pressure on all of our illiquid positions.” A seemingly promising layer-one (L1) at the time/ the fund had invested about $200M — valued to be about $550M at its peak. After the death spiral and collapse of the Terra ecosystem/ that sum was estimated to be — gasp — $500. The Dominoes Start Falling The second domino to fall in this case and affect the fund was stETH — a liquid staking derivative for users to trade ETH staked on the Beacon chain. Lido is one of the leading players in the liquid staking market and currently has about 30% of liquid-staked ETH via its protocol. Why is stETH considered liquid? Because you can deposit stETH on Aave to earn/borrow ETH. Or/ you can swap your stETH in the Curve’s ETH/stETH pool and get ETH in return. But here’s the catch: unstaking on Ethereum 2.0 is not available until some time after the Merge. That means/ although stETH will eventually be redeemable 1:1 to ETH/ holders are essentially locked-in for a pretty long period of time. But why would this matter? If a massive amount of stETH is suddenly dumped in the pool/ the balance of assets in the pool would skew towards stETH. The selling pressure would cause the value of stETH to drop — causing it to trade at a discount to ETH/ although stETH has no hard peg to ETH. Source It was reported that during the liquidity crunch following the Terra collapse that two major players withdrew a combined $800M worth of ETH from the pool — Celsius (read: a review of the Celsius halt) and 3AC. The Terra implosion and resulting selling pressure on stETH caused the coin to trade below the value of 1 Ether. According to Zhu/ the market effectively “hunted” for those that are leveraged long stETH/ so that they can profit from the liquidations and further decline of stETH. The stETH to ETH ratio further declined as more stETH was being dumped in the market. On May 12/ according to Nansen/ 3AC had removed about $400M worth of liquidity from the stETH/ETH pool of Curve. Leveraged Long Positions Leverage is a major component of any financial markets — especially in crypto where volatility/ coupled with leverage/ can give outsized returns — provided it goes the right way. After the Terra meltdown and stETH selloff/ 3AC’s lenders allowed them to continue trading “as if nothing was wrong/” according to Zhu. He elaborated that lenders were “comfortable” with 3AC’s financial position after the blowup/ although filings later showed that very little collateral was required to obtain such loans. 3AC took out loans from lenders like BlockFi/ Genesis/ Nexo and Celsius/ and leveraged long on all of its positions. Thanks to the onset of the bear market and falling crypto prices/ their loan-to-value (LTV) ratio was consistently increasing — which means a riskier chance of getting margin-called. A margin call is when your margin falls below the maintenance amount required to keep the leverage that you have taken/ causing lenders to sell your assets. This meant that the fund had to supply more assets to maintain their loan/ but their actual liquid funds were much lower than what was needed to pay off for the leveraged positions. Furthermore/ many of their venture investments were not vesting until very late. This essentially meant that 3AC had no funds left to top up collateral in their loans. The result? Liquidations of Assets A court in the British Virgin Islands ordered 3AC to liquidate their assets after they failed to repay loans. The fund itself also filed a case for its own liquidation in a court in the British Virgin Islands. A liquidation can occur voluntarily or by force/ and in this case — you’ve probably guessed it — the forceful conversion of 3AC assets to be paid back to its creditors. An advisory firm/ Teneo has been appointed to manage the liquidations for the hedge fund. Now/ it’s their job to look through the balance sheets of the fund and attempt to salvage and distribute the remaining assets fairly amongst 3AC’s creditors. The Beginning of a Contagion Court documents revealed that a total of 32 companies lent $3.5 billion to 3AC. The largest lender is revealed to be Genesis/ a crypto brokerage arm of Digital Currency Group (DCG). Genesis gave the hedge fund a $2.36 billion loan collateralized by their GBTC shares (we know what happened here)/ Grayscale Ethereum Trust shares/ Avalanche and NEAR Protocol. While Genesis claimed that it had mitigated its exposure/ several other lenders affected were not as lucky: Voyager Digital's loan amounted to $1 billion/ while Celsius lent around $70 million. Both of these firms recently declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy/ but the real tragedy is the scores of retail investors' funds — and life savings in some cases — that are locked up in these companies. This kind of credit destruction often leads to what is known as contagion — where a financial crisis spreads from one market to the other. While in this case the contagion seems limited to crypto for now/ the domino effect of other crypto lenders declaring bankruptcy cannot be ignored. Reflecting on what went wrong/ Zhu made it clear that the lenders were aware of the risks involved. “We’ve never once pitched ourselves as risk-free/ like a simple yield.” When 3AC was doing well/ lenders were benefiting immensely too. However/ when bad times came and the market went red/ 3AC's collapse showed that the risk departments of both the hedge fund and the lenders had made some pretty bad bets.

The promise was that OneCoin would become bigger and better than Bitcoin and a new revolutionary cryptocurrency. It ticked all the boxes a \"better\" coin had to tick: Safe transactions Easy to use Cheap and time-saving In reality/ it was merely an MLM scheme founded on selling plagiarized educational materials and using the \"coin\" as a front to lure people in. As early as 2015/ allegations of OneCoin being a Ponzi scheme surfaced. Still/ its following only kept growing. This culminated in CEO Ruja Ignatova/ who possesses a PhD and marketed herself as a highly intelligent entrepreneur/ appearing at Wembley Stadium in front of 90/000 people in the summer of 2016. Although OneCoin was at its peak in 2016 the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization/ several central banks cautioned against investing in it. That did not stop the founders from living a lavish lifestyle. Ruja Ignatova reportedly purchased real estate and fine art in London and had entertainment stars perform for her birthday at private parties. In 2017/ German financial authorities issued a cease and desist order. In the fall of 2017/ Ruja Ignatova vanished.

It just so happens the reasons behind the creation of crypto have a lot of similarities with the reasons behind the creation of IPFS. Let’s take a step back and look at what exactly IPFS is. IPFS/ short for the InterPlanetary File System/ is a distributed and decentralized network for storing/ accessing and sharing files/ websites/ applications and data. These two key words — distributed and decentralized — might remind you of blockchain (and they should!) but as we wrote above/ IPFS is actually a separate beast entirely. While blockchain is also a distributed and decentralized protocol/ IPFS has much broader goals. You can see it in the name itself — its founders wanted to create a truly decentralized system that could work cross places as disconnected or as far apart as planets. IPFS was invented by computer engineer Juan Benet to make the web faster/ safer and more open back in 2015. Benet is also the CEO and founder of R&D lab/ Protocol Labs which developed IPFS and cryptocurrency Filecoin/ a blockchain-based digital storage and data retrieval method. More about this later. To put it simply/ IPFS’s ambitious aims are to re-decentralize the web while safeguarding our data and improving utility applications. Subscribe Join us in showcasing the cryptocurrency revolution/ one newsletter at a time. Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox/ along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right/ millions love us!) — what are you waiting for? What Is IPFS and How Does It Work? Think of a library/ where you find a book based on a specific location determined by a code the librarian can identify quickly. With the internet/ you can do something similar — type in any search term to Wikipedia/ and voila/ you suddenly have a page of information at the ready all about/ say/ Agatha Christie. In order to get you that information about Britain’s greatest female detective writer/ your computer has to ask one of Wikipedia’s computers to get that page ready for you. With IPFS (and yes/ Wikipedia has its pages mirrored on IPFS)/ you will still find the same page of information about Ms. Christie — but the page is found not by its location/ but by its content/ found by asking many computers/ all over the world (or the planet) through IPFS. One of the crucial differences between the centralized and the decentralized web is how we identify and retrieve data — by location/ or by content. The centralized web relies on trustworthy authorities to host our data and uses location-based URLs to access it. The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is the web address we type into our browser that identifies and picks up the location of the page we are searching. With IPFS/ the onus is on the content to help you find your search — this is called content-addressing. Content-Addressing Identification IPFS searches for our information based on content rather than location. Instead of a centrally located server/ IPFS is built around a peer-to-peer (p2p) decentralized system that allows users to host and receive content/ similar to BitTorrent. Your computer uses IPFS to find files that hosted by by other computers/ and your computer helps distribute files in turn. IPFS users can store and retrieve content based on a “fingerprint” of the content itself. An IPFS fingerprint is a cryptographic hash called a “content identifier/” a CID. In simple terms/ when you are searching for something specific with IPFS/ you are asking the IPFS network to find a particular hash/ instead of a particular IP address. In more complex terms/ IPFS is a layer on top of data storage where anyone can ask for a CID and get the relevant content back/ uniquely corresponding to that CID as long as someone is broadcasting it to the network. On a decentralized and distributed web/ we can all host each other's data through this content “fingerprinting” method that relies on cryptographic hashing for security. How Is IPFS Different From the Current Internet? While the internet is decentralized by nature as it’s not owned by anyone or any company/ it relies on centralized servers to function. These servers use/ for the most part/ Internet Protocol Suites with different functions — one that you will recognize is HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) which handles communication. With the internet/ data is stored in these decentralized servers and found by location/ which makes it easy to distribute/ manage/ secure the data and scale the capacity of both servers and clients. How is IPFS different from HTTP? As you know if you study crypto/ centralized servers create a single point of failure — they can be easier target for hacks/ compromising security and privacy. IPFS was created to tackle these issues/ making the web more secure/ efficient/ and private. Another word you will hear often is “scalability” — IPFS aims to create a more scalable system than HTTP/ allowing for large transfers of data (like movies and songs) through a P2P system (remind anyone of Torrent?). Is IPFS a Blockchain? In short/ the answer is no. IPFS is often associated with blockchain because of its decentralized and distributed nature. It also shares some of the technology employed by blockchain/ like Merkle Trees architecture. However/ they are not the same/ since their scope is different. With blockchain/ nodes on the network share a ledger and hash transactions. With IPFS/ the P2P file-sharing system will hash files (not transactions) to allow users to search for files based on those hashes. Similarly to blockchain hashes/ with IPFS/ if you modify a file/ the file is not altered/ but a new one is created/ which is excellent for keeping a permanent record of changes. Blockchain and IPFS are certainly suited to work together/ though. With IPFS/ you can store files with huge amounts of data. With blockchain/ hashes have very limited storage capacity. So why not use the best of both protocols — using IPFS’s public database/ and using blockchain to make it publicly verifiable. What Is IPFS Used For? From delivering content to websites/ globally storing files and facilitating secure file sharing and encrypted communication/ IPFS offers the opportunity to do several big things with data. With blockchain technology/ IPFS can be used as a complementary file system for public networks and other P2P applications. IPFS could significantly improve Ethereum’s scalability for decentralized applications (DApps). Its interoperability with Ethereum’s smart contracts can add secure and cost-efficient storage capacity to the cryptocurrency’s ecosystem. IPFS and FileCoin (the decentralized storage we mentioned earlier method) incentivize data storage and can play a tremendous role in developing NFTs as immutable records. Simply placing an IPFS CID in an NFT/ that NFT will directly identify and reference the data much better than with an insecure HTTP link. Did you get all that? Can IPFS Be Hacked? Today/ IPFS is regarded as one of the most secure options for storing digital assets like NFTs because the CID data hashes will be stored only on your computer. And when the data is required from the IPFS/ the nodes look for the same hash within the digital asset and the local data store. We already spoke about the issues with a single point of failure on a centralized server — IPFS aims to create a more secure alternative. What Is an IPFS Node? We’ve highlighted that IPFS is a P2P protocol for storing and sharing content where users run their node (server). If you don’t want to get too technical/ the best way to think about IPFS nodes is that they can communicate between each other and exchange files. Simple. This next explanation is for the more advanced users. IPFS nodes use distributed hash tables (DHT)/ a decentralized storage system that provides lookup and storage for mapping keys to values. Each node in a DHT is responsible for keys and mapped values and can efficiently retrieve the value associated with a given key. DHT offers an easy way to find information in an extensive data collection/ because all keys are organized in a consistent format. Moreover/ the entire set of keys can be subdivided and distributed in a way that allows identifying where the key/value pair is located quickly. Think of it as a massive table that stores who has what data. IPFS Challenges IPFS represents a great way to improve the internet’s decentralization and data finding. However/ it comes with its own challenges. The biggest challenge is that IPFS needs to compete with Web2.0 applications that are widely adopted/ While the distributed and decentralized system makes IPFS better from a security and privacy standpoint/ it is more burdensome to update since changes cannot be performed internally. Upgrades must be completed through regular and systematic releases of new versions. Another relevant challenge is the availability of files. In centralized servers/ files are maintained and controlled by one party incentivized to keep the server constantly up and running. IPFS heavily relies on data files that are provided by separate nodes/ and if these nodes are offline for any reason/ these files won’t be available. However/ solutions are already beginning to emerge. In IPFS/ with increased node participation/ the content can be delivered from the nearest peer node that has a copy of that content/ thereby removing the pressure of a single node and improving the user experience. Like cryptocurrency/ IPFS will develop and thrive in accordance with the growth of its users. What Does the Future Hold for IPFS? IPFS is still quite new. While its goals are lofty — providing an alternative to the current internet/ making data more easily findable across the world (and planets) — the growing interest in decentralization and privacy/ as well as the increasing size of data that needs to be stored online/ means that IPFS’ use cases could continue to grow in the future.

Did everything just turn red and gloomy? Well, according to the latest Binance Research report — that's not the case.","title":"‘We Are in a BUIDL Market’ — Binance Research Half-Year 2022 Report | CoinMarketCap","detailedContent":"The first half of 2022 has proven to be challenging for investing in risky assets — even for not-so-risky ones. Crypto has not been spared from the market downturn. Nonetheless/ continued developments and innovation in the crypto ecosystem contributed to an optimistic view of the future of crypto/ according to Binance Research. The best time to practice for a big performance is not on the opening night/ but months before people are even aware of what will come. It's these days that are the most important for the long-term success of the space and as such/ it is worth having a closer look at what has been happening in crypto this year amidst the bear market territory that has set in. For one — the recently published Binance Half-Year Report 2022 shows that competitionbetween layer-ones (L1s) remains as fierce as ever. The total value locked (TVL) of L1s declined throughout the year/ and Ethereum has been losing market share to alternative L1s. Ethereum’s market share of TVL dropped from 96.91% at the start of 2021 to 59.01% by June 2022. Yet neither of them stopped innovating and the focus on increased scalability is still persistent — despite the different approaches towards it. According to the Binance research team/ layer-two (L2) deployment appears on track to become increasingly ubiquitous going into the second half of the year. Their expectation is that most/ if not all/ of the top-ranked decentralized applications (DApps) are being deployed in some form on an L2. Another key takeaway was the dominance of Ethereum in DeFi — which has continued to decline as other chains/ such as the BNB Chain/ catch up. Development in the space remains strong and fundraising in DeFi — $2.6 billion so far this year — has already hit an all-time high. Even within the non-fungible token (NFT) space/ trading volume in the first half of 2022 remained resilient despite a sharp decline in June. OpenSea is still the leading NFT marketplace/ but new entrants such as X2Y2 and Magic Eden have introduced strong competition. The team sees the shift to using NFT aggregators likely to continue gaining ground/ albeit slowly.

Check our video instead! ⬇️ Within a span of 12 months/ the crypto population went from speculating on the next ‘100X coins’ to searching ‘what is crypto winter?’ and ‘how long does a crypto winter last?’ This radical shift in mindset is courtesy of the bearish sentiments prevailing in the market. And it is not all about the money parked in the market. Bear markets instill fear. They demoralize investors. Forget dollars/ we are seeing hundreds of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and DeFi projects vanishing into thin air. Alongside/ the good old — ‘Crypto is a scam/ I told you’ has already started to surface. However/ the crypto market is not alone. It is correlated to the TradFi (traditional finance) markets/ which are down by huge numbers. The reason for this is rising inflation and the need for the U.S. Federal Reserves to raise rates. Due to the global pandemic/ the previous couple of years have been rough for global economies. To stimulate the economy and prevent a full-blown shut down/ central banks pushed for easy monetary policies — increasing money supply and lowering interest rates. Making Sense of Current Inflation in the Global Economy Recently/ the US consumer inflation touched its 4 decades’ peak in May 2022/ reaching as high as 8.6%/ the highest since December 1981. Adverse impacts of inflation are being felt even by traditional financial markets with all of the 11 S&P 500s sectors ending up in red. If this sounds cruel/ how about the situation in Turkey where inflation has surged to over 70%? The economic strains of the Latin American countries caused by rampant inflation are not a pretty sight with the COVID pandemic and the Ukraine-Russia crisis driving them to the ground. Argentina/ in particular/ has been estimated to be hit by an astounding 72.6% of inflation in 2022. On a similar note/ Nigeria is suffering from an inflation rate of almost 16.8%. Not only did the Naira/ their official currency/ take a major hit in purchasing power/ but they had a shock of the ages when their central bank raised the interest rates/ not even a month after the inflation highs. And understandably/ foreign investors are pulling huge funds out of Nigeria. All these numbers and metrics are a mere reflection of the ground reality. The UK reported a new/ 40-year high inflation rate of 9.1%/ as cost of living increases due to higher food and energy prices. Canada is facing a similar fate/ having reported its highest annualized rate of increase in inflation in over 40 years. There are legit arguments that the ground reality of inflation is worse than these estimates which only deepens the depths of economic despair and cost-of-living crisis citizens around the world are facing. We can circle back to the prime reason for inflation — the pumping of money/ over and beyond need/ into the circulation by governments. What is this all about? How does this result in inflation? Put simply/ more money in the hands of consumers equals more disposable income. Simple equation but the catch here is the supply of goods and services remain the same which equates to more money chasing the same amount of goods. This situation is tailor-made for businesses to increase the goods’ prices manifold since they know there is enough demand. This increase in prices results in a fall in the value of the money/ as the same amount of money can buy lesser products now. However/ we are facing an unprecedented global crisis — the supply-chain is disrupted by COVID lockdown in countries like China/ coupled with the Russia-Ukraine crisis affecting a major exporter of oil and food staples. What next? There is a need for financial tools and investment vehicles that help money retain its value/ while also maintaining liquidity. For this particular need/ we explore an asset class of stablecoins which may herald a new era of sustainable investing. Hedge Against Hyperinflation; The Stablecoin Way At their core/ stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency whose prices are pegged to the price of a certain fiat currency. They maintain their price consistency by the way of collateralization i.e. backed by reserves of some sort. The reserves can be fiat currencies/ other cryptocurrencies/ or even commodities. With more than $150 billion in market cap/ stablecoins are the ideal step in the right direction. Their supply is beyond the control of any government which protects against the innate devaluation of money. Alongside/ it can be used to conduct most financial transactions for a fraction of the cost/ in a peer-to-peer manner/ and with no regulatory oversight. Now/ how do we defeat hyperinflation using stablecoins? In countries hit the worst by inflation/ such as Nigeria/ the currency devalues and decreases the population’s purchasing power if they hold their savings in them. Instead/ they can convert the local currency/ Nairas/ into USDT or USDC or other fiat-pegged stablecoins. Their money wouldn’t have devalued due to the Nigerian inflation and more so would have had the potential to grow in value. Additionally/ those dollar-backed stablecoins could be staked or used in DeFi protocols to earn more. While some countries suffering from hyperinflation and currency devaluation like Argentina choose to convert their pesos into Bitcoin/ stablecoins offer a less volatile option to the number one cryptocurrency. Stablecoins: The Messiah For The Unbanked and Underbanked Despite the recent crisis surrounding the UST depeg and crash of the Terra ecosystem/ stablecoins reflect the potential to truly democratize global finance. 3 of the top 10 most valuable cryptocurrencies are stablecoins — Tether/ USDC and Binance USD. This provides everyone an equal chance to beat local currency volatility and hyperinflation. The global unbanked population is growing and stablecoins act as a gate pass for them to join the decentralized global economy. When this unfolds/ financial inclusion could finally be a reality.

The Ultimate Guide to the Solana Ecosystem | CoinMarketCap","detailedContent":"After a tough year full of uncertainty and volatility/ Solana rose from the ashes to be crowned Crypto of the Year at CoinMarketCap Crypto Awards 2024. Note: This award/ presented in partnership with leading crypto trading platform BingX/ recognizes Solana's resilience and the incredible dedication of its builder community. When FTX collapsed/ things took a turn downhill for Solana too. With so many SOLs held up on FTX/ FUD took over the market. Prices sank and investors got worried. But the loyal Solana builders? Their dedication only grew stronger. While the headlines projected doom and gloom/ developers kept their heads down building an awesome pipeline of new dApps with real-world use cases. The stats speak volumes - Solana’s usage metrics skyrocketed in mere months. Sure/ SOL charts took some bruises along the way - but that wasn't stopping this determined community from making a fierce comeback. With Solana's incredible journey and well-deserved recognition/ it's clear that this blockchain platform has captured the attention of the crypto world. But what exactly is Solana/ and what sets it apart from other blockchains? Today/ we're taking a deep dive into the inner workings of Solana/ exploring its unique features and the technology that powers its ecosystem. We'll uncover how Solana achieves its lightning-fast transaction speeds/ low fees/ and scalability/ and discover the wide range of decentralized applications (dApps) and use cases that have flourished on its platform. So let's start with the basics! Subscribe Join us in showcasing the cryptocurrency revolution/ one newsletter at a time. Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox/ along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right/ millions love us!) — what are you waiting for? What Is Solana? Solana is a high-speed layer-1 blockchain created in 2017 that aims to scale throughput beyond what is commonly achieved by popular blockchains/ like Ethereum and Bitcoin/ while maintaining low costs. It boasts a unique consensus mechanism called Proof-of-History that allows Solana to process transactions almost instantly. Solana can theoretically process more than 65/000 transactions per second without scaling solutions/ thanks to this lightning-fast timing mechanism/ which is a version of proof-of-stake. Solana also has a vibrant non-fungible token (NFT) ecosystem after Ethereum. Thanks to its fast and cheap transactions/ many NFT enthusiasts and creators have called Solana home for their NFT projects/ therefore it is no surprise that numerous decentralized applications (DApps) in this list are NFT-related. Although the layer-1 chain is a favorite when it comes to challenging Ethereum/ Solana has faced an array of past problems. This includes the downtime suffered by the network and the impact of FTX’s collapse on its ecosystem projects. However/ the strong community of builders and users on Solana saw through these setbacks during the bear market and turned out stronger. Now/ the Solana ecosystem is a thriving one/ with tons of exciting projects launching and building on the chain. How Does Solana Work? Solana targets the blockchain trilemma by designing a unique consensus mechanism that compromises on decentralization to maximize speed. The more transactions per second (TPS) a blockchain can support/ the more scalable it is. But in decentralized blockchains/ higher throughput slows the blockchain down because of tiny discrepancies in time. With locally timestamped transactions/ nodes verify timestamps to validate transactions. More nodes verifying transactions and timestamps takes more time. Solana solves this by having one node as the leader sequencing messages between nodes/ which is chosen based on a Proof-of-Stake mechanism. Even without a centralized and exact source of time/ nodes benefit from a reduced workload/ leading to increased throughput. By hashing one transaction output and using it as the following transaction’s input/ the network creates a chain of transactions — in other words/ a history of transactions/ hence the name Proof-of-History. The biggest benefit of Proof-of-History is the increased throughput/ which allows Solana to process more than 50/000 transactions per second. In practice/ the network has been mostly running at 1/000 - 2/000 TPS/ which is still considerably more than many other blockchains. However/ this increased throughput has come at a cost. The FTX Collapse The bear market of 2022 saw FTX/ a major crypto exchange/ collapse in November/ sending shockwaves through the entire cryptocurrency industry. No ecosystem felt the impact as deeply as Solana/ which is tied closely to FTX/ making it particularly vulnerable to the fallout. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was a vocal supporter of Solana/ frequently investing in and promoting its ecosystem projects like Serum. This association/ while initially seen as positive/ tarnished Solana's image when Bankman-Fried faced accusations of fraud and mismanagement. Furthermore/ the collapse directly affected Solana's ecosystem. FTX/ along with its trading firm Alameda Research/ held significant amounts of SOL tokens/ the native cryptocurrency of the Solana blockchain. When FTX went bankrupt/ these holdings became inaccessible/ further dampening investor confidence. Additionally/ many startups within the Solana ecosystem had received funding from FTX or Alameda/ leaving them with depleted resources and uncertain futures. This caused a dramatic decline in the value of SOL tokens/ which fell to a low of just under $10 in January 2023. The Resurgence of Solana and Its Ecosystem With sentiments at all-time-lows in January 2023/ one would be surprised to learn that merely one year later/ the price of Solana has increased by an astounding ten-fold. What caused the resurgence in price/ and the market’s sentiment/ to the layer-1 chain? Solana's resilience can be attributed in part to its dedicated developer community/ which has grown significantly despite the collapse of FTX. According to RockwayX/ a European VC firm/ the number of developers on Solana has surged by 83%. This growth is a testament to the strength of Solana's ecosystem and the belief that developers have in its long-term potential. The number of developers working on a layer-1 blockchain is a key indicator of its health and longevity. Unlike other industries/ developers are not paid to build on a blockchain; they choose to do so based on their belief in the project's potential. The fact that Solana's developer community has grown despite the challenges it has faced is a strong sign of its resilience. View post on Twitter One of the most prolific catalysts has been the rise of its first leading memecoin/ Bonk (BONK). Its meteoric rise has caught the attention of crypto traders/ which flocked to the Solana chain to trade and speculate on BONK and other memecoins. However/ it's not just memecoins on the layer-1 chain. Notable developments on the infrastructure side include Solana Mobile's Saga smartphone/ while DePIN projects are also choosing Solana/ as seen in the migration of the Helium Network. In addition/ the Solana ecosystem has seen the emergence of new DeFi tools and projects/ as well as the advancement of community-led validator infrastructure. The introduction of state compression has reduced network costs/ while AI integration has opened up new possibilities for blockchain applications. Solana has also forged partnerships with large enterprises like Mastercard and Visa/ and Solana Pay has been integrated with Shopify for fast/ feeless web3 native payments. Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services now support the Solana blockchain/ providing further validation and infrastructure for the ecosystem. So/ what are some of the most exciting DApps on Solana currently? Let’s dive in! Marinade: Leading Liquid Staking Protocol by TVL With over $1.35 billion in total value locked/ Marinade is the leading protocol on Solana by TVL. The liquid staking platform screens over 100 validators on the Solana network and routing staked assets to the best-yielding validators. Marinade Finance also offers instant unstaking/ allowing users to claim their rewards without having to wait. Liquid-staked Solana on Marinade Finance is known as marinated Solana (mSol). mSol can be used as collateral in lending protocols and can also be committed to restaking protocols to earn additional yield. Marinade Finance's staking protocol is integrated into several other projects and exchanges/ including Solfare/ Phantom/ Coinbase and Kraken. This allows users to access Marinade Finance's services from a variety of platforms and protocols. MNDE is the native token of the protocol and holders can contribute to the governance of the project. It is currently trading at a valuation of $62.5 million. Jupiter: The Leading DEX Aggregator With over $1.5 billion in daily trading volume/ Jupiter is the leading decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator platform on the Solana network. It routes orders through multiple of the top Solana DEXes/ such as Raydium and Orca/ and claims to provide the best price/ token selection and UX for users. However/ it has also released a suite of other services for users/ including limit order trading/ an asset bridge/ a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) feature/ a launchpad and a decentralized perpetuals trading platform with up to 100x leverage. The limit order trading feature allows users to set a desired purchase or sale price/ similar to centralized exchanges. The asset bridge enables users to move assets between the Solana network and other supported blockchain networks. The DCA feature helps users automate their purchases or sales by splitting them into smaller/ regular transactions. Jupiter’s JUP token airdrop at the end of January 2024 was the largest in the Solana ecosystem/ and was highly anticipated. Some early users were allocated up to a hefty sum of five figures in JUP tokens. The team plans to conduct four more rounds of airdrop to decentralize the governance of the protocol. Jito: Liquid Staking on SOL Jito is a liquid staking protocol with over $1 billion in SOL locked on the platform. The protocol aims to enhance yield earned by stakers through Maximum Extractable Value (MEV) rewards. MEV is a measure of profitability that represents the highest extra charge a validator can apply to transactions or a user can extract from a DeFi protocol. Jito claims to extract more value from DeFi protocols on the Solana blockchain and distribute these rewards among stakers on its platform. Liquid-staked Solana on the Jito protocol is known as JitoSOL. Jito uses the staked assets to secure the Solana blockchain and generate real yield for stakers. Unlike normal staking in a proof-of-stake network/ stakers can use the JitoSOL across various DeFi protocols. The Jito protocol is governed by the Jito DAO/ where holders of the Jito token (JTO) can vote on improvement proposals. JTO is also used as an incentive for liquidity providers on Jito and jitoSOL pairs. JTO was airdropped to early stakers of the platforms/ and caught the attention of the market for the size of the airdrop. Marginfi: Decentralized Lending Protocol Marginfi is a decentralized money market on the Solana blockchain that allows users to borrow crypto assets against collateral. It is overcollateralized/ meaning that users must deposit more collateral than the value of the loan they borrow. The current total value locked (TVL) on Marginfi is at $659 million/ making it the largest lending protocol on Solana. In addition to its lending services/ Marginfi also offers a suite of utility applications/ including Marginfi Swap powered by Jupiter/ a bridge to other blockchain networks powered by Mayan and more. Marginfi also offers its own liquid staking service/ which provides users with increased rewards/ zero staking fees/ and improved staking yield. Marginfi recently announced a points system which takes into account the users’ involvement in the protocol/ which could potentially qualify them for a possible future airdrop. Kamino Finance: Concentrated Liquidity Layer With over $550 million in TVL/ Kamino is one of the leading automated liquidity solutions on the Solana blockchain that provides lending/ liquidity/ and leverage on one platform. Users can supply and borrow major assets like SOL/ USDC and JitoSOL in the lending market. Users can also deposit their tokens into yield-bearing liquidity vaults and receive Ktokens/ which represent their share of the pool. Ktokens can also be used as collateral in Kamino's lending protocol/ which allows users to borrow crypto assets against their collateral. The lending protocol uses a Concentrated Liquidity Market Maker (CLMM) to control the availability of assets in the lending vault/ which helps to reduce the risk of liquidations. Furthermore/ Kamino also offers long/short vaults for users who wish to use leverage. Conclusion The protocols mentioned above are just some of many exciting projects building and advancing the Solana ecosystem. Besides decentralized applications/ many other projects are also leveraging Solana/ such as exciting DePIN projects like Helium/ Hivemapper/ Render and io.net/ to Web3 gaming projects from Aurory/ MixMob and more. With so many exciting developments ahead/ it’s no wonder that the Solana community is one of the most engaged in the space.

The nation has a largely cash-based economy/ and it’s hoped that by implementing the CBDC/ many of the unbanked will be able to improve their financial situation. The CBDC/ which is called the Jamaica Digital Exchange (Jam-Dex)/ is now issuable by the central bank following legislative action by the senate. While Jam-Dex has been in pilot testing since last year/ it hasn’t officially been released into the world/ though it will be as soon as later this month. Bank of Jamaica Governor Richard Byles has said that the new CBDC can be used to “settle any debt in Jamaica. It is the medium of exchange. It is the medium of account.” What Is a CBDC? Compared to their closest cousin in the world of cryptocurrencies – stablecoins – CBDCs are supposed to be even a notch more trustworthy and dependable. They are issued by governments/ as opposed to private companies in the case of stablecoins/ and they can always be exchanged on a one-to-one basis for the physical currency of the particular nation. While not meant as a replacement for traditional money/ they share essentially all of the same features as fiat but in digital form. Critics of CBDCs point to the power of governments to shut off specific people’s access to the coins as well as track movements and expenditures. However/ it’s clear that their essentially worldwide rollout is nearly inevitable at this point/ with over 100 countries/ representing 95% of the world’s economy/ either exploring or developing them. Why Did Jamaica Develop a CBDC? Like many countries in the developing world/ Jamaica has low levels of usage of the traditional electronic payment methods seen in developed nations/ which is part of the reason many of these countries are rushing to implement their own CBDCs. According to Steve Aschettino/ a Norton Rose Fulbright partner focused on Fintech/ “Emerging economies appear to view CBDCs as a way to jump-start their economies.” He added that the existing infrastructure for payments in the developed world is a double-edged sword/ in some cases limiting countries’ motivation to get ahead in the CBDC space. One of the main advocates for Jam-Dex in the Jamaican government/ Minister of Foreign Affairs and Senator Kamina Johnson Smith/ has said that the CBDC will greatly improve the financial well-being of people without bank accounts/ as they are not required to use the digital currency. She explained that Jamaica’s banking issues are in part due to people feeling they don’t have enough money to warrant setting up an account as well as a lack of identification – a problem the government is also trying to address with its National Identification System. Johnson Smith added that the CBDC will also facilitate commercial development/ as there are no fees for transactions. How Does the Jamaican CBDC Work? The Jamaican government will be maintaining the Jam-Dex outside of the blockchain/ so it will be ledgered on centralized servers/ a possible drawback in the eyes of some. In order to begin using it/ people will have to set up a digital wallet called Lynk. The wallets will be issued by banks as well as by other authorized service providers/ though no bank account will be required at any point. Money can be added at a “Smart ATM/” through a Wallet Provider (such as a bank)/ through wallet transfers/ and by bank transfer. Payments will be possible via QR code or wallet ID. No fees are attached to any transactions. A financial services entity called the JMMB Group is also exploring other uses for the CBDC related to e-commerce/ point-of-sale/ and more. The government has said that constructing a comprehensive infrastructure surrounding the CBDC will be essential to its success. Whether that includes more exotic offerings from the world of cryptocurrency/ such as decentralized finance (DeFi) opportunities/ remains to be seen. Conclusion Right now/ with the exception of China – where the digital yuan is expected to be rolled out in 2023 – a lot of the urgent action with CBDCs seems to be centered far away from the most powerful nations on the planet. Instead/ it’s countries like Jamaica that are taking advantage of the new technology to get a leg up in the economic race. While El Salvador was the first country to recognize crypto as legal tender in the form of Bitcoin and the Bahamas was the first to launch a CBDC with the Sand Dollar/ Jamaica’s imminent launch of a legal tender CBDC will be remembered as a groundbreaking achievement. We’ll have to wait and see whether the people take it up with as much enthusiasm as the government.

Consensus ensures network participants validate transactions without central authorities. Mining involves verifying transactions in exchange for rewards/ while consensus algorithms enable transaction validation. PoS requires staking assets to become a validator/ with higher stakes increasing the chance of selection. DPoS involves voting for representatives who validate transactions/ offering speed and scalability. PoS and dPoS differ in block creation (staking power vs democratic election) and governance (rigid vs democratic). Due to the growing emphasis on scalability/ blockchains are increasingly opting for staking-based mechanisms for securing their networks and achieving consensus. This model has become even more popular following the increased scrutiny of PoW blockchains and their high energy consumption rate. While there are several staking-based consensus protocols that developers can choose from/ the two most popular options are the classical Proof-of-Stake (PoS) algorithm and the Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) mechanism. You may be wondering which of these two models is the most viable. This article offers a detailed overview of PoS and DPoS/ along with their similarities and differences.

Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox/ along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right/ millions love us!) — what are you waiting for? What Are Consensus and Mining? What Is Blockchain Consensus? The core ethos of blockchain technology prioritizes a decentralized approach to bookkeeping. The concept ensures that each participant or node of a network can access a copy of an electronic ledger (blockchain) and confirm the validity of its content in real-time. This model stamps out central authorities like banks such that participants or network nodes collectively confirm that the data entered into the blockchain is valid. And for this to work/ the network must incorporate a means of harmonizing all the copies of the ledger held by individual members. Only then can consensus be achieved. In other words/ consensus ensures that all the network's participants agree that new entries or transactions of a blockchain ledger do not invalidate the old ones. Based on this definition/ we can define consensus mechanisms as protocols that allow network participants to validate transactions without the input of central authorities. What Is Mining? You will agree that it is somewhat hard to get people to take up the responsibility of securing a network without putting a reward system in place. This is why blockchains almost always incorporate an incentive-based economy around their consensus protocols. Such a system incentivizes the average user of a blockchain network to validate transactions. In exchange for contributing to the network's security/ validators usually receive rewards denominated in the native cryptocurrency of the blockchain. Simply put/ the process of verifying transactions to earn crypto is called mining. Participants who successfully add new batches of transactions are paid with newly minted cryptocurrencies and transaction fees. Different Types of Consensus Algorithms It is worth noting that there are several protocols specially designed to enable blockchain consensus. The following are some of the popular options: Proof-of-Work Proof-of-Stake Delegated Proof-of-Stake Nominated Proof-of-Stake Proof-of-Authority Proof-of-Time Proof-of-Validation All the above consensus mechanisms share a similar trait in that they look to enable a transaction verification system governed by the participants of a network. However/ what sets them apart is the way they go about establishing consensus and picking validators. For instance/ the Proof-of-Work mechanism requires the would-be validators to commit their computing power to the network. On the other hand/ Proof-of-Stake allows validators based on their willingness to lock an amount of cryptocurrency on the blockchain. Why Blockchain Needs Consensus Mechanisms As mentioned earlier/ consensus protocols enable decentralized systems for validating the data entered into blockchain ledgers. They ensure that blockchains are not reliant on central authorities. Instead/ they ascertain that network participants/ due to the incorporation of consensus protocols/ can play important roles during the validation process. Consensus protocols implement and manage systems for randomly picking validators responsible for adding new transactions to the blockchain. The protocols also incentivize participants to work in tandem with the goals of the blockchain at large. Hence/ activities that contribute to the security of the ecosystem are rewarded. On the other hand/ some consensus protocols penalize validators for downtimes or malicious activities. What Is Proof-of-Stake (PoS)? As mentioned earlier/ the Proof-of-Work (PoW) protocol/ which is the first variant of the consensus algorithm ever created/ requires multiple nodes to set up powerful mining machines to stand a chance of becoming a validator. According to Digiconomist's Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index/ the average Bitcoin transaction consumes 704.75 kWh of electricity – the equivalent of the power consumption rate of an average household in the U.S. for approximately 24.16 days. And so/ the need for energy-efficient alternatives to PoW birthed the Proof-of-Stake mechanism. Unlike PoW/ Proof-of-Stake requires users to stake certain crypto assets to prove their commitment to becoming validators. In essence/ the would-be validators need to lock assets on the blockchain as a sign of commitment toward the well-being of the network. The whole idea revolves around the reasoning that it will be irrational for participants to compromise the validity of the network if their money is on the line. The PoS mechanism randomly selects validators from the pool of stakeholders. Think of this as a lottery-based selection system whereby the lucky winner gets to add new batches of transactions to the blockchain. Every time a new block of transactions is added/ the lottery kickstarts again to pick the next validator. Note that the chances of emerging as a validator tend to rise as the number of staked coins increases. In other words/ nodes with higher stakes (the number of tokens locked on the blockchain) tend to have a higher chance of being selected as validators. Another factor that influences the selection process is the duration of the stake. Additionally/ successful validators receive the newly minted coins native to the PoS network as rewards. This is in addition to transaction fees. Another important detail about PoS is that it poses penalties to discourage malicious acts. Defaulters – validators who fail to complete their task or add invalid transactions – risk losing part or all their staked funds. Defaulters may even receive a ban after losing their stakes. An example of a blockchain that uses the PoS mechanism is Ethereum. Advantages and Drawbacks in Proof-of-Stake Advantages The following are the advantages of the PoS consensus mechanism PoS offers a significant improvement in terms of energy consumption when compared to the Proof-of-Work algorithm. The staking-based validation process of PoS blockchains makes them far more energy-efficient than PoW networks. The PoS consensus mechanism establishes an economy that incentivizes or penalizes validators. This system/ to a large extent/ prevents the occurrence of fraud and nonchalance on the part of validators. Since the computational requirements for staking are not as technical as that of the PoW mechanism/ more blockchain users can partake in the validation process. Going by our definition of consensus/ the more people involved in keeping the network safe/ the more decentralized the blockchain becomes. Hence/ staking is a more inclusive model compared to the mining mechanism in PoW-based ecosystems. Drawbacks of PoS The PoS consensus algorithm tends to restrict the validation process to high net-worth participants/ considering that stakers with high stakes are usually prioritized. However/ some solutions have found a way around this. They set up a platform where users can pool and jointly stake their assets. These solutions allow network participants/ who ordinarily can not meet the minimum financial staking requirement/ to do so as collectives. It also improves their chances of being picked as a validator. It is also worth mentioning that blockchains are susceptible to a threat called the 51% attack/ which usually occurs when an entity controls over 50% of the network's resources. In the case of PoS consensus-based blockchains/ the 51% attack occurs when an entity owns more than half of the total amount staked by the entire network. During such attacks/ it becomes possible to manipulate the blockchain's historical data. What Is Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS)? Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) is another variant of staking that borders on speed and scalability. Unlike the PoS consensus mechanism/ DPoS sets up infrastructures that open the transaction validation system to the entire network. It looks to get everyone involved/ even those who are unable to meet the minimum requirements for becoming validators. The concept tries to democratize the network so that the average user can vote for representatives that will take up validation-related tasks on their behalf. As its name implies/ DPoS allows the average blockchain user to vote for representatives who are ready to take up the technical requirements of validating transactions. How Does DPoS Work? Voting As mentioned earlier/ voting is a vital component of DPoS. The protocol assigns voting powers to users based on the number of the blockchain's native tokens they have staked. In some cases/ stakers can transfer their voting power to other users instead of voting directly for a validator node. Witnesses Witnesses are node operators elected to add new blocks of transactions to the blockchain. They have to meet the required hardware specifications for block producers. More importantly/ they ought to have a good reputation in order to attract enough votes. Once witnesses successfully add new blocks of transactions/ they receive rewards/ which they can share among the stakers who voted for them. Transaction Time The transaction time of dPoS is a lot shorter than that of PoS. This is because most DPoS blockchains maintain a small network of witnesses – usually between 20 and 100. As such/ it takes less time to verify a block of transactions. Delegates Delegates are core elements of the governance of DPoS blockchains as they propose changes that would shape the future of the blockchain network. The proposed changes are then put up for a vote. This governance voting exercise is open to all participants of the network as long as they have staked the network's native token. Limitations of Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) Having explained the workings of a DPoS consensus mechanism/ you may be wondering: what are its limitations? Since a limited number of nodes power the verification process/ dPoS blockchains tend to become centralized. This is particularly true for blockchains that rely on a handful of witnesses to verify transactions. Differences between Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) Judging by the working principle of the PoS and DPoS consensus protocols/ it is clear that the major differences between these two protocols center around two factors/ namely block creation and governance. Below is a detailed explanation of how the block creation and governance techniques of PoS and DPoS make them different. Block Creation The PoS protocol bases its validator selection process on the staking power of users. In other words/ users become eligible to become validators when they lock assets on the blockchain. In contrast/ dPoS enables a democratic system whereby token holders elect validators. Since dPoS assigns transaction verification roles to a handful of participants/ the block creation time – the time it takes to add a new block of transactions – is usually shorter. PoS/ on the other hand/ allows just about any node operator to compete for the role of validators as long as they fulfill staking requirements. Hence/ it takes a lot more time to select validators. Governance Additionally/ governance in a PoS ecosystem is a lot more rigid than it is on dPoS blockchains. The latter enables a democratic model which allows users to vote on changes. On the other hand/ PoS blockchains implement a hard fork or a major change to their underlying code such that users need to move to an upgraded version of the blockchain software.

Introduction While the crypto industry is working tirelessly to comply with the regulatory aspect in the US/ regulators and the SEC are actively targeting many different players in the industry. In this article/ CoinMarketCap Academy discusses one of the most feared words in crypto-land: the Wells Notice. On March 22 this year/ public company and popular crypto trading platform/ Coinbase/ received one of those dreaded Wells notices. Shortly after receiving this letter from the SEC/ Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong tweeted the following: View post on Twitter The Wells notice comes in a series of actions from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission – which has been fining and investigating crypto firms across the board recently. Coinbase was not the first crypto firm to receive a Wells notice/ as stablecoin issuer/ Paxos/ was issued a similar letter from the SEC regarding the stablecoin. Let’s dive into what this all means/ the potential consequences/ and how it affects crypto. What Is a Wells Notice? A Wells notice is a formal notice from by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)/ issued to inform individuals or firms of potential violations of securities laws. Essentially/ it serves as a warning/ giving the recipient of the notice some time to respond to the alleged violations before the SEC takes legal action. Wells notices are issued for a variety of reasons/ such as market manipulation or facilitating the trade of unregistered securities. When a company receives this notice/ it can have far-reaching consequences on its reputation – but firms are not legally obliged to disclose receipt of a Wells notice. For instance/ Kraken recently settled a matter with SEC concerning its staking program – which led certain opinion leaders in the industry to believe they were issued a Wells notice as well. Whether this is true or not/ remains unknown. In any case/ when the SEC issues a Wells notice/ firms tend to respond rather quickly. What Is a Security? As Wells notices are issued when companies or individuals are potentially in violation of U.S. Securities laws/ it is important to understand what a security is. Sadly/ this is precisely the challenge many crypto firms face: the regulatory environment is unclear. While there are reasonably straightforward guidelines about what is a security (the Howey test/ for example)/ the SEC has been ambiguous about whether cryptocurrencies/ like Ethereum/ are securities. In a recent Congressional hearing that also covered the FTX bankruptcy saga/ SEC Chair Gary Gensler refused to say whether he believed Ethereum was a security. It got even more confusing when the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) called Ethereum a “commodity/” while the State Attorney General of New York asserts that it is a security. All in all/ when it comes to crypto/ the answer to the question “what is a security” remains unclear. Let’s get back to the main topic: Why Is It Called a “Wells Notice”? The term and concept of a Wells notice was born in the seventies when the Wells Committee was founded. The committee/ led by its namesake John. A Wells/ consisted of at least four other members – whose primary objective was to assess the SEC law enforcement practices and policies. After careful assessment and consideration/ they proposed several procedures that were incorporated into the current SEC policy. One of these procedures is what is known today as the Wells notice. Essentially/ the Wells notice was named after the chairman of the commission that invented the concept. What Are the Potential Consequences of a Wells Notice? When a firm receives a Wells notice/ it serves as a warning that the SEC staff is considering enforcement action/ which may harm the firm’s reputation. But what are the other consequences of a Wells notice? Firstly/ the firm may face sanctions/ fines or other forms of crackdown. They may also be forced to shut down certain services. If the SEC decides to proceed with enforcement actions after issuing the Wells notice/ it may freeze a firm’s assets or file formal complaints against the company in a federal court. This starts a lengthy and complicated legal proceeding/ where the firm will have the opportunity to defend itself in front of a judge. How and Why Does the SEC Serve a Wells Notice? A Wells notice does not suddenly appear out of nowhere. In fact/ there is a process that leads up to it/ and the issuance of a notice kickstarts a process of follow-up steps as well. The SEC exists to provide regulatory clarity and enforces the federal securities laws. Its primary goal is to protect investor interests and prevent wrongdoing. Issuing a Wells notice is just one of the many tools SEC has at its disposal to do its job. Generally speaking/ the process of issuing such a notice looks something like the following: The SEC launches and completes an investigation into a company they believe to be in violation of one or more securities laws/ gathering evidence of the alleged violations. The SEC issues a Wells notice to the company they believe to be in violation of one or more securities laws – outlining the investigation and specifying the potential consequences of the alleged violations. The firm that received the notice has 30 days to respond to the allegations to build a case for their innocence. The SEC carefully reviews the firm’s response to the Wells notice and decides whether it will proceed with enforcement action. Essentially/ the Wells notice is a tool for the SEC to enter discussions with an individual or firm that they find to be in potential violation of securities laws/ allowing them to clarify their position before deciding on whether to press charges. What Is the Procedure for a Wells Response? After receiving a Wells notice/ a firm has 30 days to respond to it. Generally speaking/ firms quickly seek legal counsel from experienced securities law attorneys to respond appropriately. From there/ a legal team carefully weighs the options in collaboration with the firm’s leadership. If the firm decides to fight the case/ the evidence must be gathered to support the firm’s innocence/ which can be presented to the regulator in response. Are Wells Notices and Subpoenas the Same Thing? While both Wells notices and Subpoenas may be issued by regulatory bodies such as the SEC/ Finra or CFTC/ they are very different. A wells notice – as discussed in this article – is merely a warning of potential enforcement action/ whereas a subpoena is an order signed by a judge that requires the recipient to provide evidence in an investigation or legal proceeding – so they are fundamentally different! How Does a Wells Notice Affect the Crypto Market? Wells notices can have far-reaching consequences for the cryptocurrency market. Not only did the Wells notice to Coinbase cause an 8% move in Bitcoin prices/ but it may also force the crypto exchange to shut down its staking service or parts of its spot market offering. Similarly/ the Wells notice to Paxos forced the blockchain infrastructure platform to shut down the issuance of new BUSD tokens/ reducing the competition in the stablecoin space. All in all/ this type of notice not only causes volatility but also may reduce the products and services available in the crypto industry. All we can do is hope that the SEC stays true to its mission of protecting investor interests. Writer’s Disclaimer: This article is based on my limited knowledge and experience.

Titled \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System”/ the whitepaper served as an antidote to the global banking crisis of 2008/ which the genesis block of Bitcoin referenced months later by including a famous newspaper cover. A number of overleveraged banks collapsed during the subprime mortgage crisis and ultimately got bailed out by their governments/ while thousands of retail investors and homeowners lost everything. The newspaper cover added to the Genesis block Choosing this dramatic failure of the banking system as its main focus/ the Bitcoin whitepaper proposes an ambitious new decentralized digital cash system that did not rely on traditional financial institutions/ instead using cryptography to ensure the security and authenticity of transactions.

Bitcoin Whitepaper in Broad Strokes The Bitcoin Whitepaper was published on 31 October 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto The paper introduced Bitcoin as a digital currency and proposed a trustless system of electronic transactions. The paper is only nine pages long/ and in 12 sections/ it attempts to explain complex technical concepts in easy-to-understand language. Abstract The Bitcoin whitepaper opens with an abstract that summarizes the intent and content of the document. Bitcoin aims to create peer-to-peer (P2P) technology for direct payments between multiple parties without having to rely on financial institutions to act as trusted intermediaries/ thus making transactions faster/ cheaper and the whole financial system more transparent and secure. All digital currency systems must first solve the issue of double spending/ where a token could be spent twice if duplicated or falsified. This is the reason we use intermediaries/ like banks/ to have a party that can mediate in such cases. However/ mediation leads to more verification and thus slower and more expensive transactions. To overcome this/ Satoshi proposes Bitcoin’s decentralized network use cryptography and a combination of innovations such as a timestamp server/ proof-of-work consensus mechanism/ and block incentives to ensure that honest nodes/ who want the best for the chain/ collectively control the blockchain’s hash power (the total computational power of the network). Sorry for making you read all that. I just wanted to wake you up a little. While these concepts might as well be in Greek for you right now - if you’re new to Bitcoin - we will cover everything in detail in this simplified Bitcoin whitepaper guide. When you’re done/ come back to this section and read it again to see if you understand it! Introduction Satoshi kicks things off with a first chapter that criticizes the traditional financial system/ where people are forced to rely on centralized parties/ or intermediaries/ to make digital transactions. These systems work based on trust/ which is provided by a third party/ usually a bank/ who runs the network. However/ this trust system has some major weaknesses. The third party has to handle transaction disputes/ which makes completely non-reversible transactions impossible. This mediation adds costs and slows down transactions. Also/ some fraud cannot be avoided and merchants need to collect more customer information/ leading to privacy issues. So why do we tolerate a system that gives us expensive and slow transactions/ fraud and lack of privacy? Simple: we’re scared of double-spending. What Is Double Spending? The double-spending problem occurs when a person spends the same digital currency twice. While this is not possible with physical fiat currencies/ where you can’t spend a physical note twice/ double spending can certainly happen in digital currency systems. Where there is no party in the middle to keep records/ mediate and enforce as needed/ transactions are non-reversible. It’s like a football game without a referee. Who’s keeping score and how? The answer: no one. This might be all fun and games when you’re a kid/ but when you’re playing for your financial freedom/ you’re playing for keeps. This is where Satoshi’s genius begins to show. They state that we don’t need a financial system based on trust (ie. the third-party referee who we hope remains impartial and didn’t place a huge bet on the home team). Instead/ we can use technology/ specifically cryptography/ to establish a trustless system (read: Bitcoin) to enable direct electronic payments without the need for intermediaries. In blockchain and Bitcoin/ the spectators and players are all referees/ working together to keep score. TL;DR The traditional financial system suffers from slow and expensive digital transactions by being forced to use trusted intermediaries/ like banks/ to avoid the risk of double spending. Bitcoin solves this by using cryptography/ instead of trust/ to establish a decentralized network ledger of all transactions/ validated by the majority of participants. Transactions Cool/ now Satoshi has outlined the problem that needs to be solved: we need to find a way to eliminate double spending from this new financial system we are creating to be free of intermediaries. Let’s talk strategy! What Is a Coin? First off/ Satoshi defines an electronic coin as simply a chain of digital signatures/ in other words/ lines of protected online code. The ledger containing a history of all transactions is the actual currency. To transfer a coin/ the owner (payer) must do the following: 1) Digitally sign a hash of the previous transaction2) Digitally sign the recipient’s public key 3) Add these signatures to the end of the coin/ which the recipient (payee) can verify to confirm the payer’s ownership. Still/ while the payer might be the owner/ what’s to stop him from double spending the coin (sending it to more than one payee)? Until now/ a trusted central authority or mint is used to check every transaction. However/ if this party messes up their records or worse/ goes bankrupt/ poof! There/ potentially/ goes all your money/ like we’ve seen in 2008 and 2023’s banking crises. In Satoshi’s words: “We need a way for the payee to know that the previous owners did not sign any earlier transactions.” To solve double spending/ they propose two objectives to achieve this and help synchronize records: All transactions must be announced in public. A system is needed where a majority of the network agrees on a single history of the order in which transactions were received/ validates them/ and provides proof of this to each payee. This means that only the first transaction with a coin counts. The network users must be aware of all transactions/ and all later transactions must be rejected. TL;DR An electronic coin is just a bunch of verified signatures that accumulate over time as its ownership changes. Signatures alone may prove who owns a coin/ but can not stop double-spending. For this/ the network needs to either use a trusted intermediary or time-stamping cryptography to ensure there is consensus on the history and order of all transactions. Timestamp Server OK/ so now we know what a financial system must look like in theory to slay the double spending dragon. Let’s talk execution. How do we create this single united timeline of Bitcoin transactions/ and kill off a potential Back-to-the-Future-like multiverse where you’re stuck in your Delorean after losing all your Bitcoin Lambos to an unscrupulous crypto Biff Tannen? You get the idea. Well/ it’s actually quite easy. Satoshi proposes specific software to digitally timestamp data and thereby create a chronological order of transactions. The timestamp server provides public proof for anyone to see that a particular block existed on the blockchain at a specific time. Each block contains data on multiple transactions and all of this gets added to the mathematical hash function/ which in turn spits out a hash. What Is a Crypto Hash? A hash is a unique/ cryptography-created short string of numbers and letters/ which provides proof that the block is correct and authenticated. Bitcoin uses a specific hashing algorithm called SHA-256. Bitcoin's SHA-256 hashing refers to the specific cryptographic hash function utilized in the Bitcoin network. It stands for Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit/ and it is a widely used hashing algorithm in various applications/ including Bitcoin. In Bitcoin/ SHA-256 hashing is extensively used in various aspects/ including the verification of blocks/ the creation of digital signatures/ the mining process and the overall security of the blockchain. Its cryptographic properties contribute to the immutability and trustworthiness of the Bitcoin network/ making it resistant to tampering and ensuring the validity of transactions and blocks. When a Bitcoin miner adds a new block to the blockchain/ they timestamp the block's hash/ which also includes the previous block's timestamp. The new timestamp proves the data exists/ and reinforces all the other timestamps before it. This creates a chain of verified blocks (let’s just call it a blockchain💡) that can each prove the authenticity of all previous timestamps. This is very important because the Bitcoin network runs on a distributed system of computers that must together agree (reach consensus) on the longest chain of data records. This hash plays a crucial role in the Bitcoin network. All transactions are time-stamped and hashed/ and they get broadcasted to the network for verification/ where it’s used to solve complex related mathematical problems (in proof-of-work/ which we cover next). Once a miner solves the problem/ the transaction is confirmed and added to the blockchain/ forming a permanent record of all transactions that prevents double-spending. Even if the payer sends the same coin to other parties/ only the first transaction to be timestamped is accepted as valid. This helps the whole Bitcoin network share only one history of transactions. TL;DR The timestamp server provides a timestamped hash that is publicly available to everyone in the Bitcoin network to verify. This ensures that transactions are processed in the correct order/ which in turn prevents double-spending and adds an extra layer of security to the Bitcoin network. Proof of Work Great! Now that we know how to solve double spending (answer: a timestamp server)/ the next challenge is to figure out how to achieve this AND keep the bad guys from overwhelming the network with spammy denial of service (DOS) attacks or fraudulent transactions. The answer/ as with most things in life/ is that you gotta put in the work. In this case/ Proof-of-Work is the transaction processing tool that/ despite its high energy consumption/ has made Bitcoin the safest and most decentralized cryptocurrency in existence. What Is Proof of Work? Proof of Work (PoW) is a consensus mechanism that ensures all transactions on the Bitcoin network are verified and added to the blockchain in a secure and tamper-proof way. Here's how it works: Miners compete to solve a really complicated math problem by guessing a unique number called a \"nonce\"/ which they use to create a hash code that has to be lower than a certain target value/ proving that the necessary work has been done to create a new block. This process requires a lot of computing power on purpose/ making it hard for anyone to cheat the system and ensuring that blocks do not get created too fast/ thereby inflating the supply of Bitcoin more than is needed. The Bitcoin whitepaper calls this a “one-CPU/ one-vote system”. The honest nodes in the network follow the rules and work to keep everything secure and control a majority of the network’s CPU power (we discuss the reasons in the “Incentives” section later). When a miner successfully solves the PoW puzzle and updates the blockchain/ they get a block reward paid out in Bitcoins immediately. This incentivizes miners to help keep the system running and secure. While the timestamp server figures out the order of all transactions/ its PoW mechanism makes Bitcoin tamperproof/ ensuring that nobody can flood the network with fake transactions due to the high cost and difficulty level. Satoshi recommends the algorithm change its difficulty based on how frequently blocks are created/ in order to keep up with technological advances as per Moore’s Law. A block's hash has to meet specific conditions/ and the longest valid chain with the most work is considered the right chain. TL;DR PoW establishes a tamper-proof transaction history/ which involves solving a cryptographic puzzle/ and once a valid block is discovered/ it is shared/ verified and added to the blockchain. Network OK/ slowly but surely/ Satoshi’s Bitcoin vision is coming into focus. Can you see it yet? Section five of the Bitcoin whitepaper is short/ providing a step-by-step guide needed to run the network. These steps are as follows: Participants in the network broadcast transactions to all nodes. Each node collects all new transactions into a block. Next/ each node uses computational power to try and find the right hash value for a very complex math-based Proof of Work problem. Once it solves the hash/ it broadcasts this to the network/ with the first node claiming the block rewards. The network nodes check the block/ and if it hasn’t been spent yet/ declares it valid. Nodes now start the race for the next block in the chain. If two nodes broadcast two different versions of a block/ the nodes consider the one on the longest chain as correct. (The rejected one is called the Uncle block) Once the block is successfully added/ the other nodes recognize it as the definitive blockchain/ update their records and start working on the next block on that chain. TL;DR In the Bitcoin network/ transactions are broadcasted to all nodes/ collected into a block/ and validated through a complex Proof of Work problem before being added to the longest blockchain/ which is recognized as the definitive record by all nodes. Incentive Now that it’s been established how to queue transactions (with a timestamp server)/ and process them correctly (through proof of work)/ the next step is to devise a scheme to motivate users to use their hardware to help grow and secure the network. Running a node to mine Bitcoin is both expensive and complicated. As the equipment and electricity prices increase/ Bitcoin’s PoW algorithm gets more difficult over time. Without these miners to put in the work in Proof of Work/ there could be no sustainable Bitcoin network/ which means no digital gold/ no HODLing/ and certainly no glorious altcoin seasons or DeFi Summer for all the degens reading this. Therefore/ miners must be incentivized to work hard and stay honest/ doing what’s best for the network. The system does this by rewarding the first miner to solve a block’s proof-of-work puzzle with a fixed amount of newly-minted Bitcoin in the first transaction of the new block. In theory/ the block reward can either come from newly-minted coins or from collected transaction fees. Right now/ it’s all newly minted Bitcoin/ also known as increasingly valuable virgin Bitcoin/ which is born free of any potentially harmful associations with previous crimes. When the last Bitcoin/ number 21/000/000/ is mined in around the year 2140/ only transaction fees will be used to reward miners. The Bitcoin mining incentive is another shining example of Satoshi's brilliance/ as it keeps nodes “honest” and working not only for their own benefit but also for the greater good of the entire network. Nodes are discouraged to try to cheat or overtake the network by the high amount of computing power required. Let’s say an attacker(s) gathers more hash power than all the honest nodes/ they have a choice of rolling back the chain to steal back their payments/ or they can rather just mine new Bitcoins with it. The first option destroys the value of all their coins/ as participants will choose to leave such a corrupted network/ while the second one preserves the value of their coins and allows them to gain more through mining. For any party acting in their own self-interest/ only option 2 makes sense. OK hold up. I see a hand in the back. You ask: How come has 19 million BTC already been mined in under 15 years/ but it will take another 120 years to mine the remaining 2 million BTC? Pay attention/ because you should know the answer to this question! Roughly every four years/ the Bitcoin halving event cuts Bitcoin’s block rewards by 50% in order to slow down inflation and drive up its value. The next halving/ projected for June 2024/ will reduce its current rewards at block 840/000 from 6.25 Bitcoins per block to a measly 3.125 Bitcoins per block. The Bitcoin halving algorithm is touted by many experts as the reason why we experience a classic 4-year cycle in crypto/ as it creates a huge supply shock. TL;DR Bitcoin has no centralized intermediary to play policeman and stamp out bad behavior. Therefore the Bitcoin network (and all other public blockchains) must incentivize and reward its miners by offering block rewards for the first miner that finds the right transaction hash value needed to create a new block. Reclaiming Disk Space This section can get a bit tree-ky/ as it introduces the concept of Merkle trees. In short/ Satoshi foresaw that/ over time/ Bitcoin’s blockchain would grow massive in size/ requiring more and more storage capacity from nodes. This adds another costly barrier to entry for miners/ which is not ideal when you are trying to build a global decentralized currency to be used by billions of people. Therefore/ they proposed that the Bitcoin ledger should be kept lean without compromising its historical data. Instead of deleting past transactions/ Satoshi recommended using a Merkle Tree to make their data more compact in order to save disk space/ by saving only a trace or root of each of these historic transactions. What Is a Merkle Tree? A Bitcoin Merkle tree is a way of organizing and verifying all the transactions that occur within a block on the Bitcoin network. A Merkle tree is a way of storing data that makes it easy to check if any part of the data has been changed or tampered with. A Merkle Tree hashes all the transactions in a block into pairs/ which it then hashes together. It continues until there is only one hash left/ known as the root hash/ which is used to verify that all the transactions in the block are valid and haven't been tampered with. Any attempt to alter a single transaction is immediately noticeable and will result in the rejection of the entire block. TL;DR Storage space is important to the future of Bitcoin. Therefore/ Merkle trees shrink historical data to a single root hash without impacting their cryptography/ thereby helping to preserve the ledger’s total disk space. Simplified Payment Verification Great Scott! Let’s take a step back a second and admire the Bitcoin network’s magnificent framework/ which is now clear as day for anyone to see - even through that pesky early Dark Web filter. By now/ we know the following about Satoshi’s invention: What it’s going to do (solve double-spending) How it’s going to do it (timestamping transactions and incentivizing proof of work verifications) How it will save disk space to store all those billions of future transactions to come (Merkle tree) Wait/ I hear you say. ”What billions of future transactions? You said there are only 21 million Bitcoin that will ever be minted/ not even enough for half of the (nearly) 50m dollar millionaires in the world!” Well/ if you build it/ they will come. Welcome to section 8 of the Bitcoin whitepaper/ which paves the way for Bitcoin’s mainstream adoption by billions of users around the world. To use the Bitcoin blockchain/ you don’t need to invest a fortune into running a full node (a digital copy of the entire chain) to verify payments. This would not be sustainable and will/ frankly/ make it impossible for billions of regular people to join the Bitcoin revolution eventually. Instead/ you can simply download only the block headers and a Merkle branch that links transactions to their correct block. Most Bitcoin users do this nowadays automatically by using a basic crypto wallet application. Nearly all commercial software and hardware wallets are considered simplified payment verification (SPV) nodes. While these lightweight SPV wallets cannot check the validity of a transaction/ they allow users to make transactions quickly/ easily and securely. SPV wallets do this by connecting to other nodes on the network to verify transactions/ rather than downloading the entire blockchain. This allows for a much faster and more efficient experience. TL;DR You don’t need to run a full node in order to use the Bitcoin network. You can transact as you wish by using a lightweight Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) wallet. Combining and Splitting Value Even 15 years after Satoshi’s whitepaper/ how often do you hear your no-coiner friends say “I can’t afford to buy a whole Bitcoin”? Here’s what to tell them: Just like we can pay for anything under the value of $1 with various coins (cents)/ so can 1 Bitcoin be split into smaller fractions called satoshis/ allowing it to be used for payments of any value. One satoshi equals 0.00000001 BTC/ making Bitcoin a very practical currency to use/ suitable for anything from property deals to micro-payments worth a few cents/ to the new craze of Bitcoin Ordinals. Bitcoin’s transactions are made up of multiple inputs and outputs/ which allow BTC’s value to be either split into smaller parts before being sent somewhere or combined to create a bigger amount. For example/ if you have one whole Bitcoin/ you can divide it into smaller parts/ like 0.5 BTC and 0.5 BTC. Or if you have two smaller amounts of Bitcoin/ like 0.3 Bitcoin and 0.7 Bitcoin/ you can put them together to make one full Bitcoin and become a wholecoiner. This feature is super important because it lets you buy things both more expensive and cheaper than 1 Bitcoin. Also/ by spreading all these pieces of BTC across the Bitcoin network/ we allow potentially billions of wallet addresses to eventually hold at least some Bitcoin in them. TL;DR You don’t need to send or receive a full Bitcoin during a transaction. BTC can be split into smaller parts or combined to make a bigger amount. Privacy In traditional banking systems/ all information about user’s transactions is usually protected and private/ which opens the door to potential fraud and abuse. Bitcoin aims to be a transparent and immutable public blockchain/ but it doesn’t mean it doesn’t protect the privacy of its users when they transact. All Bitcoin transactions are recorded on its blockchain without revealing personal information/ and the parties in each transaction are only identified by a unique alphanumeric public key. To maintain security/ Bitcoin requires a private key/ that only the user knows/ in order to sign a transaction. However/ all Bitcoin transactions can still be traced back to their public key/ also referred to as a public address/ which can link back to your real identity if you’ve completed Know-Your-Customer (KYC) verification on a centralized exchange somewhere previously/ in order to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. This makes Bitcoin pseudonymous/ which means it’s only partially anonymous. Looking back now/ this can be viewed as a beautiful compromise by Bitcoin’s creator to ensure that the network provides users with some privacy during transactions without sacrificing transparency and security/ and remains flexible enough to meet the various regulatory compliance standards/ which Satoshi expected to come as the network gained traction over time. Calculations Still here? We’re near the end/ and this next section is super complicated and not really important unless you’re into flexing your math skills. In this section/ Nakamoto provided calculations to consider how many blocks would need to be added before a recipient could be confident the sender could not change the transaction. In short/ section 11 considers the scenario of an attacker trying to generate an alternate chain faster than the honest chain. TL;DR It would be highly unlikely for the Bitcoin network to be successfully attacked by fraudsters due to the massive amount of computing power required. Conclusion In the final section of their masterpiece/ Satoshi recaps their whitepaper/ highlighting all the different components of Bitcoin and how they worked together to create a secure electronic payment system that did not rely on trust between parties. While digital signatures can be used to control ownership/ a way had to be found to prevent double-spending. Satoshi proposed a P2P network that records transactions and becomes difficult for attackers to change if honest nodes control most of the CPU power. The network is simple/ unstructured and robust. Nodes don't need to be identified and can come and go as they please/ as long as they accept PoW data when they return. Nodes vote with their CPU power to accept valid blocks and reject invalid ones. The PoW consensus mechanism can enforce rules and incentives. Bitcoin Whitepaper: Key Takeaways Thank you for reading this simplified guide to the Bitcoin Whitepaper. It’s been an honor to share the genius of Satoshi Nakamoto’s masterpiece with you/ and I hope you now understand why the virtues of Bitcoin continues to spread across the world. Here is a recap of a few things to remember before you go so you can recite them the next time a no-coiner tells you crypto is a Ponzi: Bitcoin is built on blockchain technology to create a decentralized database that records digital transactions. Bitcoin transactions use cryptography instead of centralized intermediaries to maintain security and privacy/ and they are pseudonymous in nature. Proof of Work is used to prevent abuse of service attacks by requiring members of the network to prove that a specified amount of work has been completed/ which is incentivized with rewards in the form of Bitcoins. The Bitcoin network keeps a trace or root of transaction data to maximize disk space and keep the entire history of the blockchain intact. You don't have to be a miner to be involved in the Bitcoin network; you can also send and receive Bitcoins with a Bitcoin SPV wallet. Bitcoins can be split into multiple parts or combined to make a larger amount for better practicality and efficiency. The Bitcoin Whitepaper: What Has Changed Since 2008? No blockchain is an island/ not even Bitcoin/ which has gained some notoriety for its followers’ resistance to change. Following the whitepaper’s release/ Bitcoin has undergone some of the following changes: Nakamoto added a 1MB block size limit to the Bitcoin code in 2010 to prevent technical challenges. The debate over the 1MB block size became more heated/ with some believing it limited Bitcoin’s potential as a global currency standard and that Satoshi didn’t anticipate the huge surge in network activity and user numbers. Eventually/ the issue led to 2017’s Bitcoin Cash (BCH) hard fork/ which split the Bitcoin community into two camps by creating a forked chain with a block size of 8MB to include more transactions. BCH proponents held fast that Satoshi couldn’t have anticipated the rapid growth of the network/ and that based on the title of his whitepaper/ Bitcoin should become digital cash/ not digital gold. This debate still rages on today. As mining difficulty increased/ miners abandoned CPUs in favor of custom-built ASIC mining machines and began working together in mining pools/ making Bitcoin’s nodes more centralized and energy-intensive. Bitcoin can now be used with the Lightning Network for small/ instant payments. Nowadays/ due to its increasing value/ slow transaction speed and reputation as an inflation hedge/ thanks to its limited supply and periodically halved mining rewards/ Bitcoin is considered to be more like digital gold than electronic cash. Bitcoin’s Taproot upgrade in 2021 brought with it smart contract functionality/ better privacy and reduced transaction data. This has since led to interesting new use cases/ such as Bitcoin ordinals NFTs and BRC20 assets This article contains links to third-party websites or other content for information purposes only (“Third-Party Sites”).

Although different in their ways, the crypto space already has a few solutions that offer funds recovery in case of mishaps.","title":"How To Recover Your Seed Phrases? Alternatives to Ledger’s Recover Service | CoinMarketCap","detailedContent":"Cryptocurrencies are trustless by design/ meaning they don't require users to trust a central authority to maintain the integrity of the blockchains they operate on or keep their assets secure. But this comes with a major challenge — cryptocurrency users need to secure their own assets to truly leverage their unique benefits. This self-sovereignty ensures no third party has access to their funds/ enabling true financial autonomy and freedom. Practically/ this means users need to securely generate and store their seed phrases and/or private keys so that they can be retrieved in the event of an emergency. To help reduce this burden/ Ledger recently announced an opt-in social recovery feature/ which allows Ledger hardware wallet owners to split their seed and store each shard with a different trusted entity. By providing proof of identity and undergoing other checks/ the user could retrieve their key shards from the custodians to recover their assets. This feature was met with stark criticism among crypto natives/ who argue that it opens the door to surveillance/ potential collusion and even forcible seizure — since a government could force Ledger to reveal the key shard holders. In response to the pushback/ Ledger postponed the release of the new feature. Fortunately/ those in need of a seed recovery system have several open-source options to choose from — most of which are resistant to censorship and collusion by design. Here/ we take a look at some of the most secure options. Subscribe Join us in showcasing the cryptocurrency revolution/ one newsletter at a time. Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox/ along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right/ millions love us!) — what are you waiting for? Use a Multi-Signature Wallet As the name suggests/ multi-signature wallets require signatures from multiple private keys to authorize a transaction. This ensures a single key cannot control the funds contained in the wallet. These wallets are typically used to distribute transaction signing responsibilities over multiple parties — helping to maximize consistency/ increase security and improve regulatory compliance. Though multi-signature setups are typically leveraged by businesses and other organizations/ they can also be used by individuals to bolster their security and improve recoverability should they lose access to their private keys or seed. Multi-signature wallets allow you to retain access to your funds even if you lose one (or potentially more) of your signing keys. If you create a 2-of-3 wallet/ you can easily recover your funds if you lose 1 key/ whereas a 4-of-7 wallet allows you to lose 3 keys without compromising your funds. Related reading: Learn about Account Abstraction. By creating a multi-signature wallet and storing the private keys in secure locations/ you can easily access your funds even if a key is lost. You can then transfer your funds to a new multi-signature wallet and repeat the secure storage process to maintain your protection. Today/ many popular cryptocurrency wallets feature native multi-signature support. This includes Electrum and Specter (Bitcoin wallets) as well as Casa (Ethereum wallet). Some also offer an additional layer of security/ thanks to hardware wallet support. Some wallets/ known as collaborative multi-signature wallets/ also offer secure key custody solutions/ requiring you to trust a third party with the security of your key(s). These generally require you to complete KYC and potentially pay a fee — your identity can then be used to recover your private key(s) if needed. This is somewhat similar to Ledger’s proposed Recover service. Shamir's Secret Sharing Method One of the simplest seed phrase splitting and recovery methods/ Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS) allows you to securely split a seed phrase into several shares/ which you can then distribute to multiple independent people or entities. Should you ever need to reconstruct your seed phrase/ you then need to obtain enough shares from your trusted chunk holders. These chunks then be combined to form the secret. This process is known as social recovery. The purpose of SSS is to distribute data among a group/ such that no single individual can glean any information about the nature of the secret. If a single share is compromised/ the attacker would not be able to reconstruct the secret. The attacker would need to access at least the minimum quorum number of shares to reconstruct the secret. Shamir's Secret Sharing is used to divide a secret into n number of shares/ such that any k number of shares can be used to reconstruct the secret. For example/ you might divide a secret into n = 7 shares/ requiring at least k = 4 shares to reconstruct the secret. The system accomplishes this by using polynomial interpolation/ whereby a secret is represented as a point on a polynomial curve/ and shares are also points on that curve. By defining a threshold/ you determine how many shares are required to reconstruct the polynomial and the associated secret. This setup can be used to distribute your seed (as shares) to reliable individuals or entities since they will be unable to deduce any information about the nature of the secret without obtaining at least k number of shares. Several well-known hardware wallets now support Shamir backups/ including the Trezor Model T and Keystone Wallet. View post on Twitter Because of the risks of collusion or malware/ it is necessary to take steps to securely generate and recombine the seed if using SSS — multiparty computation is one such way to achieve this. Consider Multiparty Computation Multiparty Computation/ or MPC/ is a cryptographic concept used to aggregate computational inputs from multiple parties/ helping to increase redundancy and security. The system allows users to cooperate with each other to perform computations without revealing anything about their individual inputs/ allowing users to remotely collaborate securely and privately to perform potentially complex operations. This is particularly useful when transacting large sums or splitting up authorization to engage with smart contracts. Multiparty computation can be combined with Shamir's Secret Sharing technique to enable the trustless recovery of cryptocurrency seeds or private keys. Here’s how it would work: Secret Splitting: Use SSS to split the seed phrase or private key into 'n' shares in such a way that any 'k' out of these 'n' shares are needed to reconstruct the original secret (where k <= n). This is known as (k/ n)-threshold secret sharing. Share Distribution: These shares should be distributed to trusted friends/ family members/ or other trustworthy individuals. It is important that these can be easily contacted or reached but are not known to each other to prevent collusion. Recovery: When you need to recover your seed phrase or private key/ you will then need to contact at least “k” members of your secret sharing network and have them participate in the reconstruction process. Reconstruction: You can then use MPC software to combine the 'k' shares and reconstruct the original secret. This can be done in such a way that the individual shares are never revealed to any single party/ including the owner. Through MPC/ the shares can be used to perform the necessary computations to reconstruct the secret without the shares themselves being reconstructed. Some institutional cryptocurrency custody solutions are known to leverage multi-party computation — Fireblocks being one prominent example. Redundant Backups One particularly simple but often overlooked way to protect your seed phrase and maximize recoverability is to keep backups stored in multiple geographic locations. This will give you enough redundancy to protect your assets even in the worst-case scenarios — such as a natural disaster or war. Today/ there are a large number of robust seed and private key metal wallet storage solutions that can be combined with redundant geographic storage to provide robust protection against most potential calamities. For an additional layer of protection/ consider encrypting your seed phrase or private keys prior to inscribing it/them on a metal wallet using a cipher. You can then memorize the cipher decryption key to ensure only you can unlock your funds should your metal wallet backup ever be discovered by an unauthorized person.

Read more in our CT roundup!","title":"Last Week on Crypto Twitter: Will the Streak Continue? | CoinMarketCap","detailedContent":"Gm/ Last week was a completely normal abnormal week in crypto. Basically the same as always: Prices falling off a cliff/ recovering miraculously/ stablecoins depegging/ shady new companies emerging and Gary Gensler stuck in the middle of all of it. Plus a massive winning streak on the line… Whose Threads Are a Must-Read? Not an overly busy thread section this week/ but there were a few noteworthy entries. The market is looking as shaky as it has been in a long time/ and 0xSalazar explains what is going on in the market. His thread is a speedrun through the Binance and Coinbase events recently: View post on Twitter TLDR: Binance and Coinbase have both received letters from the SEC Binance US has paused USD deposits and withdrawals/ transitioning to a \"crypto-only\" platform. Coinbase is transitioning to a more crypto-friendly environment/ and may be used as a tool in an economic war between the US and China. We haven’t had product-related news in a looong time (guess why)/ so last week’s announcement of the Uniswap V4 version was a welcome pattern interrupt. KingJulian summarized all you need to know in his thread: View post on Twitter TLDR: Uniswap v4 introduces features like arbitrary code hooks/ improved gas efficiency/ the singleton implementation/ flash accounting/ and support for native ETH. It also introduces TWAMM/ which allows executing large orders over time to minimize price impact/ and ERC-1155 token accounting/ which can reduce gas costs. Uniswap v4 is still a work in progress and the complexity may be a barrier for casual users. Has ChatGPT been slow and error-prone for you too in the last few weeks? Then you’re not alone. But it’s still a useful tool/ as we explained in the How To Use ChatGPT for Crypto Research article. Kofi published a neat video about the DeFiLlama ChatGPT plugin which you also should check out: View post on Twitter As the crackdown on crypto in the US marches on/ China is marching in the opposite direction. Hong Kong is embracing crypto. Omid Malekan has a good explainer thread about that: China is pivoting hard into crypto/ despite the misconception that it has been banned. The US is trying to kill crypto/ but this is actually helping to promote it globally. Big banks are hesitant to onboard crypto companies due to the threat of decentralization. View post on Twitter Last but not least/ the BlackRock Spot ETF application was the big news of the week. This thread explains the chances of it passing: View post on Twitter Wisdom of the Week Chris Burniske reminded us last week that it’s the darkest before the dawn. Quit crypto now at your own peril: View post on Twitter Elon Building Twitter No big news from Elon Musk last week/ who continues building Twitter into his vision of a public townsquare for everyone. So far/ Tucker Carlson is the only pitchman/ but Elon is encouraging others to follow: View post on Twitter Talk of the Town The talk of the town on the public townsquare was a hodgepodge of FUD/ shady characters emerging and new entrants to the market. In the FUD section/ we had CZ denying rumors that Binance is propping up the price of BNB by selling BTC for it: View post on Twitter The FUD will/ obviously/ not stop coming. Tether's CTO Paolo Ardoino can relate — the stablecoin received its biannual dose of FUD last week when the Curve 3pool tilted towards USDT/ meaning customers were swapping into other stablecoins: View post on Twitter The shocking 0.2% depeg caused everyone to speculate whether it’s time for a new merry-go-round of stablecoin depegs. Paolo Ardoino deployed a bespoke version of “steady lads” and the peg was restored: View post on Twitter Ardoino also fought back new possible FUD over possible exposure to Chinese commercial paper. Just another day at the Tether office. In non-panic-related news/ Prometheum was the new dodgy kid on the crypto block 1) What Yup/ that was pretty much everyone’s reaction to this: View post on Twitter We explained this wildcard of a crypto main character in our explainer article about Prometheum. Well/ the list of centralized-crypto-firms-that-went-busto is still getting cycled through. Celsius has been called up and will liquidate some of its altcoin assets soon: View post on Twitter There was something to celebrate/ too (presumably). Just when the SEC struck its low blows/ a big player starts showing interest in offering Bitcoin to its customers. Isn’t it funny how this works: View post on Twitter Of course/ you can’t say TradFi without saying “possible government collusion” in the same sentence: View post on Twitter The actual investment may not be the most cost-effective way to get into Bitcoin but hey/ is that really so important to crypto degens? View post on Twitter BlackRock’s 575-1 streak in ETF approvals is up against Bitcoin’s 0-100 streak in denials...talk about a main event! So just after one of the most brutal weeks in crypto/ we do get the predicted institutional demand. Not the time to stop paying attention to crypto now. And just before the bell rang/ ZachXBT was unfairly slapped with a defamation lawsuit by MachiBigBrother: View post on Twitter But in a rare show of unity/ Crypto Twitter showed there are indeed decent people in the space. Zach’s plea for raising funds to fight the lawsuit was answered by: CZ Bankless Adam Cochran Arthur0x Crypto DonAlt Vance Spencer Shibetoshi Nakamoto And many/ many more. Zach even burned his share of his own memecoin because that’s just who he is. Talk about wholesome: View post on Twitter Our Favorite Coinfession You have to give it to Bitcoiners for staying true to the cause: View post on Twitter Memes What a week it’s been in crypto: Stack the wins/ even if they’re smol: That’s all for this week/ see you next week!

Tether previously reported to the New York Attorney General’s Office (NYAG) as part of its settlement obligations in 2021. CoinDesk later filed/ under New York’s Freedom of Information Law (FOIL)/ disclosure of Tether’s quarterly reports. On June 15/ Tether dropped the legal fight to keep that information private/ allowing CoinDesk to receive the documents from the NYAG. The company emphasized its “continued commitment to transparency” and added that the “information is now much less relevant.” The reports released are up to the middle of 2021. Tether also highlighted that it has cut commercial paper reserves to zero and reduced its secured loans portfolio since the original reports. View post on Twitter Although CoinDesk has not reported on the reserve data yet/ Tether has called the timing of the depeg suspicious.

Heck yes/ there is. At least for now. Because the SEC is coming after crypto with an eviction order to throw all of us out on the street. This was a wild week. The detailed play-by-play of it/ summarized below. Whose Threads Are a Must-Read? Last week’s elephant in the room was the SEC lawsuit against Binance and Coinbase. The details of that and the reactions to it are covered in the “Talk of the Town” section/ but Redphonecrypto wrote a separate thread on the current state of the crypto exchange market: View post on Twitter The TLDR: Each iteration of the crypto exchange landscape gets better/ forcing pre-existing exchanges to innovate. Future competition will come from three places: TradFi/fintech/ new exchanges and DeFi. Don't give up on crypto. The topic was everywhere/ as you would expect. Gary Gensler/ already a crypto heel/ is now in full Lord Voldemort mode to extinguish any kind of relevant status crypto still has. But Gary was not always so anti-crypto. In fact/ Ram Ahluwalia argues in his thread that Gary Gensler is the Anakin Skywalker of crypto: View post on Twitter In short: Chair Gensler was initially a crypto advocate/ praising decentralized networks and Algorand. Gensler's shift to a crypto critic was likely due to his ambition to become US Treasury Secretary. Gensler's story is compared to Anakin Skywalker's transition from Jedi to Sith. There was a spicy extra bit of information about Gensler that surfaced after the thread was written/ so keep reading until the end… Were there any non-SEC-related news or threads? You bet. It may not look like it now/ but there will be a time when crypto analytics tools will come in handy again. And then you will be happy to have bookmarked threads like this one about the best crypto tools: View post on Twitter And while it most definitely may not seem like it now/ there will be a time and a place for airdrops again/ as well. One of the biggest future airdrops will likely be the Zk-Sync airdrop. Cyclop covered a best-of-threads to farming that one here: View post on Twitter Last but not least/ NFTs are still around as well. Well/ sort of. The market is a wasteland/ but there was still a noteworthy new entrant to it. No other than Louis Vuitton entered the NFT market and Farokh explained the what/ why and how here: View post on Twitter Elon Building Twitter No drama or wisdom sections this week since the drama was crypto’s main event this week. But we do have an update from Elon building Twitter. Several/ in fact. One concerning the new monetization rules for creators: View post on Twitter The other update was Elon complaining on a Twitter space with Robert Kennedy Jr about ad spend leaving Twitter: View post on Twitter Maybe more ad spend would help Twitter to re-hire some engineers that tackle the recent account hacks? Those have become increasingly common among Crypto Twitter accounts: View post on Twitter Running the “digital public townsquare” is no easy feat/ it seems. Talk of the Town Crypto Twitter experienced a Cambrian explosion of activity last week but not for the right reasons. You’ve probably already heard about it/ but if you have not/ here’s the big news again: The SEC is clamping down. Again. Reason enough for the crypto haters like Stephen Diehl to run a victory lap. Interestingly enough/ ETH was not named as one of the coins that is a security. Early in the week/ BTC withdrawals from Binance looked negligible/ though Bitcoin proceeded to nuke to $25K over the weekend. So how bad is this really? According to Adam Cochran pretty bad for Binance and medium bad for Coinbase. It really can’t be that bad when the government itself uses the “illegal dealer/” can it? View post on Twitter Some/ like Jon Wu/ even argued this would be long-term bullish for crypto. At last/ the SEC revealed its securities trump card/ making it easier for future projects to play by its rules. It sure doesn’t feel like that now/ but one can hope. Reactions were predictably… downbeat. We thought this is America? Isn’t this America? View post on Twitter Gary Gensler evidently is on a revenge mission and isn’t particularly fuzzed about hiding it: View post on Twitter That became even more evident when two days after the Binance lawsuit this spicy bit of news broke: View post on Twitter Gary’s advances were rejected and now he’s committed to making the industry’s life a living hell? Could it be this easy? It seems it could: View post on Twitter Amidst all of this/ there was one group of crypto hodlers that remained unshaken. Unbothered. Moisturized. Happy. In their lane. Focused. Flourishing. Ok/ not quite. The lawsuit was a big topic among Bitcoiners. Some/ like Cory Klippsten were rather/ ahem/ pleased by the SEC's actions. But even the Bitcoin community isn’t fully in unison over this one. Others/ like Udi Wertheimer/ think the lawsuits will do damage to Bitcoin as well: View post on Twitter So who’s right here? If you feel particularly adventurous/ read the “lawsuit is bad for Bitcoin” side of the argument by Nic Carter or the “they had it coming” counterargument by Dylan LeClair. So where does this leave us? It isn’t a fair fight. Even non-crypto people like Mark Cuban acknowledge as much: View post on Twitter But as long as CZ doesn’t have to get the AKs out to defend his exchange/ things aren’t looking great but not that bad yet either: View post on Twitter In case crypto really does go to zero soon/ you may want to cash out your last $3500 and seek refuge in Apple’s new multimedia ski goggles: View post on Twitter Our Favorite Coinfession The absolute state of crypto companies/ Q2 2023: View post on Twitter Memes The only upside of the SEC lawsuit nuke was that it gave memelords plenty of material to work with. Last Tuesday was particularly interesting on Twitter.

,{"link":"https://coinmarketcap.com/academy/article/how-to-protect-your-seed-phrase","websiteSource":"CoinMarketCap","type":"article","summary":"Protect and recover your crypto wallet using a seed phrase. Explore secure methods like paper wallets, metal wallets, hardware wallets and more.","title":"How To Protect Your Seed Phrase | CoinMarketCap","detailedContent":"A cryptocurrency seed phrase/ also known as a mnemonic/ is a sequence of words that contain all the information needed to access and use an associated cryptocurrency wallet. Typically consisting of 12 to 24 words/ seed phrases are generally automatically generated by wallet software/hardware upon the creation of a wallet. This wallet then manages and secures the seed phrase/ and uses the associated private keys to sign transactions. Your seed can be used to recover your wallet/ should you accidentally delete your wallet or lose access to it for any reason. Since this list of words is quite literally the key to your wallet addresses (and the funds they contain)/ it’s important to take steps to keep it as secure as possible. Unfortunately/ there is no one-size-fits-all solution to keeping your seed phrase safe. But there are several different options to choose from/ at least one of which should suit your personal security needs. Here/ we take a look at four of the most popular methods/ looking at how each one works to keep your seed secure. Paper Wallet If you’ve ever created a cryptocurrency wallet before/ odds are you also made a paper wallet at the same time. As the name suggests/ this is a piece of paper with your seed phrase written or printed onto it. It’s used to provide a simple backup of your seed/ allowing you to easily restore your wallet if it is lost or rendered inaccessible. Typically/ this paper wallet is then hidden in a secure location/ for retrieval later if needed. While simple and effective/ the paper wallet is one of the least secure ways to store your seed phrase. Since paper is easily damaged/ mistaken for trash/ or stolen/ it is not considered a suitable method for seed storage — particularly for those with a sizable portfolio. Nonetheless/ if you’re first getting to grips with cryptocurrencies and are looking for a temporary solution before moving on to something more robust/ paper wallets can provide a suitable stopgap. As always/ you should never store your seed phrase on an internet-connected or potentially unsafe device/ being sure to write it directly on your paper wallet before moving it to a secure location. To help further fortify your paper wallet consider using one or more of the following additional measures: Write the seed phrase manually in invisible ink Encrypt the seed phrase using a cipher (stored in a separate location) Split the seed phrase across multiple locations Store your paper wallet in a bank safety deposit box Paper wallets are suitable for temporary seed phrase backups/ or as secondary/tertiary seed backups if associated funds are small. Security: 2/5 Simplicity: 5/5 Cost: 5/5 Metal Wallets If you like the convenience of paper wallets but aren’t comfortable with trusting your financial security to the integrity of a piece of paper/ then metal wallets present an attractive alternative. These are similar to paper wallets in that they provide a physical backup of your seed phrase which you can then hide somewhere secure. The difference is/ the seed phrase is etched or engraved onto a more robust medium — some kind of metal. Unlike paper wallets/ metal wallets are generally extremely hardy and can resist most kinds of abuse. They’re fire resistant/ impact resistant/ and some are stain and corrosion-resistant. Anybody with an etching pen and a suitably sized sheet of blank metal can easily create a mnemonic. Popular metals include stainless steel/ titanium/ and aluminum. But in most cases/ if you’re looking to make use of a metal wallet/ you’ll be best served by simply buying one of the numerous off-the-shelf solutions available. These range considerably in their form and price/ but all serve the same purpose — keeping your seed(s) safe. Some of the more popular premium solutions include the Ledger Billfodl and CryptoTag Zeus. These can vary in length (e.g. 12/ 16/ or 24 words) and the number of seeds they can support and price/ but generally cost ~$100+. Some cheaper off-the-shelf solutions can be found for under $50. Metal wallets are the next step up from paper wallets and are a no-brainer if you have the materials readily available. Security: 4/5 Simplicity: 4/5 Cost: 3/5 Hardware Wallet By far the most secure and capable seed phrase storage solution on this list/ hardware wallets/ also known as cold wallets/ allow users to not only secure their seed phrase but also directly manage their cryptocurrencies. These take the form of air-gapped physical devices designed to isolate your seed phrases from the internet and keep them safe from physical theft. Even if the device itself is stolen/ the seed phrase is generally secure/ since it is secured by one or more secondary defense measures — such as biometric security or a pin code. Unlike many desktop/ mobile and web wallets/ hardware wallets are generally immune to malware and most feature robust physical defense measures — such as robust tamper-evident casing/ secure elements and automatic erasure protocols. When purchasing a hardware wallet/ these are some of the factors you’ll need to consider include: Price Supported assets Recovery options Build quality Security measures Usability Though hardware wallets allow you to store your seed phrase securely/ they are generally best used in combination with a metal wallet — since your funds can be rendered inaccessible if you forgot your pin and some hardware wallets do not allow you to retrieve your seed once entered. Likewise/ if your hardware wallet is lost or broken/ the metal wallet will allow you to retrieve your funds and/or set up a replacement hardware wallet. Some of the more premium hardware wallets include a metal wallet/ but this is not the standard. If you’ve got a sizable cryptocurrency portfolio then a hardware wallet is a must-have. But beware/ many hardware wallets can only store 1 seed at a time. Security: 5/5 Simplicity: 2/5 Cost: 2/5 Brain Wallet (Memorization) Brain wallets are another way to store your seed phrase. As you might have guessed/ a brain wallet is formed by memorizing your seed phrase. When memorized correctly and robustly/ brain wallets are by far the most secure way to store your seed phrase/ since there is no physical trace of the seed and it is immediately available wherever you are. The benefits of a brain wallet are clear. Unlike the other kinds of seed storage/ It cannot be easily stolen/ damaged/ copied or coerced out of you. But it does come with one major drawback — if you forget your seed/ your funds may be gone forever. Fortunately/ it is possible to dramatically improve how well you can retain and recall your seed by using one or more memory techniques. Suitable systems include the Method of Loci/ Pegword System or Story Method. That being said/ no matter how confident you are in your memory/ we do not recommend using a brain wallet as your sole seed phrase backup. Instead/ it is best used as a secondary backup system when your primary system is inaccessible — such as while you’re traveling or in an insecure location. Brain wallets should be considered a backup of last resort.

Don't throw in the towel just yet! Let us simplify the technical details to make it understandable for you.","title":"Polygon Lightpaper Simplified: Understanding the Technical Details | CoinMarketCap","detailedContent":"Formerly Matic Network/ the project rebranded in February 2021 as Polygon — a suite of layer-2 scaling solutions designed to massively expand the utility and capabilities of Ethereum/ while powering an interconnected landscape of decentralized services. Like most blockchain platforms/ Polygon is primarily presented to the world through a whitepaper and ‘lightpaper’ — a document that summarizes the purpose/ features and capabilities of the platform. Despite its attempt to simplify the value proposition of the Polygon network/ the lightpaper still remains somewhat cryptic — particularly for less experienced readers. For this reason/ we’re going to break it down/ helping you better understand what Polygon is/ how it can be used/ and how it’s different from existing blockchain solutions. To get the most out of this explainer/ you will need a basic understanding of blockchain technology — including some prior knowledge of consensus mechanisms/ the blockchain trilemma and cross-chain communication. Subscribe Join us in showcasing the cryptocurrency revolution/ one newsletter at a time. Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox/ along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right/ millions love us!) — what are you waiting for? Why Was Polygon Created? As a \"protocol and framework for building Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks/\" Polygon is tackling several of the biggest problems facing the blockchain industry today. These include the poor user experience that comes with using decentralized technologies/ as well as the scaling and flexibility limitations most current-generation smart contract platforms suffer from. At the time of writing/ the Ethereum blockchain can only process somewhere in the order of 12-15 transactions per second (tps) with average transaction fees that have/ at times/ exceeded $50. This is primarily due to its block size/ transaction propagation rate and stringent security measures. For comparison/ the VisaNet electronic payment network can process in excess of 65/000 transactions per second. Due to its relatively low throughput and high fee environment/ it isn’t uncommon for Ethereum transactions to be delayed for several minutes or even hours — which can be a frustrating experience for users. Polygon aims to tackle some of Ethereum's current limitations while providing the tools developers can use to build custom general or application-specific blockchains that can interoperate both with each other and Ethereum. Note: These challenges are being directly addressed in Ethereum’s post-merge roadmap. These blockchains can host novel decentralized applications (DApps) that can tap into the unique properties of the blockchain while still benefitting from the unrivaled security of Ethereum’s massive validator network. The Polygon protocol stack helps these otherwise independent blockchains from part of a connected landscape of chains/ allowing for more powerful and complex applications and use cases. You can think of a dApp as a regular application that is simply hosted on a blockchain network instead of a centralized server. The Internet of Blockchains Polygon is frequently described as the “Internet of Blockchains”. Put simply/ it means it is designed to seamlessly connect the various projects building on Ethereum — reducing friction/ lowering barriers to entry/ and paving the way for the first wave of cross-chain DApps. Interoperability has proven to be one of the longest-standing challenges facing the blockchain space today. It has led to blockchain tribalism and massive duplication of efforts and has/ arguably/ hindered collaboration in the crypto sphere. Several platforms are designed to address this challenge/ with Polygon being one of the most prominent. But how does Polygon differ from other layer interoperability solutions? You might ask. Well/ Polygon can be broadly described by its main features. These are what separate it from other platforms and make it attractive to both developers and users. The lightpaper describes the main features that best capture the essence of the platform. These are: ETH Compatibility: Developers can easily deploy Ethereum-compatible blockchains that can process their own transactions while leveraging Ethereum’s industry-established tech stack/ standards and huge adoption. Scalability: Most blockchains are heavily limited in the number of transactions they can process per second/ thereby limiting their utility. Polygon allows developers to create separate Ethereum-compatible blockchains/ which can process transactions both cheaply and securely/ massively increasing the throughput of the overall Polygon ecosystem. Security: Polygon chains are secured by a set of validators and benefit from the additional security of the Ethereum base layer. Polygon regularly checkpoints its state to Ethereum (roughly every 34 minutes)/ adding a further layer of security for users and developers. In total/ the Polygon Network is secured by 100 validators which are selected through a regular on-chain auction process. Sovereignty: Rather than relying on Ethereum for governance/ each Polygon chain is self-governing with customizable rules describing how the chain operates and updates. Interoperability: Most blockchains operate entirely independent of one another and cannot easily or securely exchange data or assets — e.g. assets on Ethereum cannot be directly transferred to Solana or another blockchain without relying on middleware. Polygon provides protocols that allow compatible chains to exchange any kind of information/ opening the doors to collaboration between chains and reducing tribalism in the blockchain space. User Experience: Polygon improves the experience of interacting with blockchain networks by drastically reducing fees and providing what it describes as “instant (deterministic) transaction finality”. Broadly/ this means transactions are considered final as soon as they are added to a block/ unlike probabilistic blockchains/ like Bitcoin/ where transactions can be considered increasingly final based on how many blocks have passed since they were confirmed. Developer Experience: Polygon provides an Ethereum-like development experience. It's permissionless/ meaning anybody can begin building with Polygon/ and no fees are required to deploy on the network besides the standard gas costs. Developers can use most standard Ethereum development tools (e.g. Alchemy/ Hardhat/ and Remix) to build for Polygon/ reducing the barrier to entry. Modularity: Polygon chains are highly customizable/ thanks to a range of modules. This reduces barriers to entry and time-to-market while ensuring developers can easily extend or upgrade the functionality of their chain. Ok/ so but what exactly are “Polygon Chains”? Well/ the Polygon Network is an interconnected network of sovereign blockchains — some of which may be tailored to specific applications/ while others may be general purpose. Smart contracts deployed on one chain can interact with those deployed on another/ forming one cohesive network. How Does Polygon Work? As is the case with many prominent blockchains/ the Polygon lightpaper is sprinkled with technical jargon — doubly so when discussing its capabilities and features. Let’s break it down! As we previously touched on/ it allows developers to launch their own customized Ethereum-based blockchain. This can be tailored to the individual needs of the project or platform and will be interoperable both with other Polygon chains and with Ethereum. Polygon aims to make it as simple as possible for developers to deploy a blockchain — even with little to no blockchain development experience. It achieves this by providing an array of tools/ technologies and features that developers can use to build and power their products. Broadly/ these include: One-Click Deployment: Developers can choose to deploy one of a range of preset Ethereum-compatible blockchains in a single click even with no development experience. Modular Architecture: These blockchains can be customized with a growing range of optional modules/ allowing developers to tailor the consensus model/ governance capabilities/ virtual machine implementation/ and more to their specific needs. This means they can build a blockchain that is perfectly tailored to their requirements — e.g. prioritizing security over speed or user-friendliness over developer-friendliness. Arbitrary Message Passing: Polygon chains can communicate with both one another and Ethereum/ allowing smart contracts on one chain to leverage data and assets from another where permitted. Put simply/ this means tokens deployed on one chain can be used on any other chain in the Polygon Network while enabling more feature-rich DApps. Security-As-a-Service: For use cases where security is paramount/ developers can tap an array of security services/ using Ethereum-based or dedicated validators to add an additional layer of security to their applications. This makes it suitable for enterprise use cases where developers need to manage their own validator set/ or for public chains where it is acceptable to bootstrap security from a pre-existing validator set. As a framework for building highly scalable interoperable blockchains/ Polygon gives developers the opportunity to build on the solid foundations of Ethereum/ while further benefitting from the additional capabilities Polygon provides. Moreover/ developers can choose from a variety of security models when building their Polygon chains/ this includes Proof of Stake (PoS)/ Plasma or Hybrid (PoS + Plasma) security. They can also choose which scaling system to implement/ including layer-2 options such as optimistic rollups (ORs) and zk-rollups — ensuring they can meet their technical requirements or ideological concerns. Or in more simple terms/ Polygon allows developers to build blockchains that are secured in different ways and process transactions differently. As of now/ developers can choose from one of three different scaling solutions/ but this will expand to at least eight in the near future. Right now/ the platform supports two consensus mechanisms — Proof of Authority and Proof of Stake — which determine how the network is secured and how blocks are produced. Read more: What Are Cryptocurrency Layer 2 Scaling Solutions? The Polygon Architecture Polygon is different from many blockchain platforms in that rather than existing as a single layer/ it’s actually formed of four separate layers — two of which are optional while the other two are mandatory. This makes it incredibly customizable/ giving developers a great deal of flexibility when building blockchains and novel decentralized applications. Briefly/ these layers are as follows: Optional layers Ethereum Layer: The base layer on top of which Polygon operates. This is used for things like staking/ communication between ETH and Polygon chains/ and transaction settlement through the checkpoint mechanism. Despite being a layer-2 solution/ projects can opt to skip using Ethereum and instead rely only on Polygon validators for security. Security Layer: An optional security-as-a-service layer that allows Polygon chains to make use of validators to improve security. This layer can have various implementations/ allowing developers to choose how their validators are managed (e.g. in terms of registrations/ rewards/ shuffling/ etc). This is for developers that want to add an additional layer of security to their chain. Mandatory layers Polygon Networks Layer: This is the ecosystem of different sovereign blockchain networks connected with one another using Polygon technology. Each of these is responsible for its own local consensus/ transaction grouping and block production. This means if one Polygon chain suffers downtime/ the others remain unaffected. Execution Layer: This is Polygon's execution environment/ which developers can use to execute their smart contract code. This takes the form of a virtual machine which is used to interpret code as well as the logic used to transition the blockchain to the next state. In this case/ the term “state” is used to describe the current arrangement of the blockchain/ including the list of confirmed transactions/ user balances/ active addresses/ etc. As transactions are processed and smart contract operations are performed/ the state is gradually updated. This is achieved through state transitions. By stratifying across four layers/ Polygon is able to modularize different blockchain functions and maximize flexibility for developers. How Polygon Fits Into the Blockchain Landscape The final part of the Polygon lightpaper describes its positioning — that is/ where it fits into the broader blockchain landscape. Right now/ this is primarily comprised of popular layer-1 blockchains/ like Ethereum and BNB Chain; sidechains that work alongside a layer 1 to extend their functionality like RootStock (which extends Bitcoin); and interoperability solutions to enable cross-chain communication and asset transfers/ like Polkadot and Cosmos. Did you know? Layer 1 blockchains operate independently/ whereas layer 2 blockchains operate on top of an underlying blockchain (typically a layer 1). Polygon sits at the intersection of these alternative platforms and protocols by providing a flexible framework for developing custom blockchains and applications. It aims to offer the most attractive mix of features across key factors/ like Ethereum compatibility/ scalability/ security/ interoperability and user experience/ to become the platform of choice for developers. Long-term/ Polygon aims to contribute to a \"world in which people and machines collaborate and exchange value globally and freely/ without gatekeepers or intermediaries.” It is hoped that the project will provide the infrastructure to power part of this new world/ and help knock down financial and social borders.

But how did it come to be? And why is it so popular? In this article/ we will dive into the history of Tether and how it works to answer all these questions and alleviate the frequent bouts of Tether FUD that can afflict crypto investors. Ironic for what is supposed to be a stable asset/ there’s a lot going on in the world of USDT and the utility it brings to the entire blockchain industry is more important than you may think. Subscribe Join us in showcasing the cryptocurrency revolution/ one newsletter at a time. Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox/ along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right/ millions love us!) — what are you waiting for? What Is Tether (USDT)? Tether (USDT) is a collateralized stablecoin asset issued by Tether Limited and pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar/ shielding its holders from wild swings in cryptocurrency markets. USDT is also used as a common currency between different exchanges/ allowing users to move their funds quickly and conveniently without having to go through fiat currency conversions. Tether tokens can be minted or burned on demand depending on market conditions/ with the number of tokens always backed by cash equivalents or other assets such as gold held in its cash reserves. Is USDT Cash? While USDT can be used by customers to send and receive payments on various platforms/ it is not actually cash in the traditional sense. Rather/ it operates more like an IOU; when you buy USDT/ you are essentially buying a promise from Tether Limited that they will honor your purchase with the equivalent amount of U.S. Dollars at any time upon request. Then again/ fiat currencies operate on the same premise/ with the only difference being they are redeemable IOUs from central banks instead. Although USDT may be exchanged for goods and services just like cash/ its true value lies in its ability to maintain its peg to the U.S Dollar and provide users with a reliable way of transferring funds. Digital currency traders and investors require a digital store of value that remains stable if they choose to remain on the sidelines during times of market volatility. Having USDT on hand waiting to buy a market dip or exit precarious market conditions is much more convenient than moving funds to and from your bank each time you exit or enter the market. Also/ the cost of converting fiat to crypto (and vice versa) is expensive compared to merely paying gas fees/ as you are dealing with TradFi intermediaries. Is USDT a Threat to Crypto? There seems to always be some “Tether FUD” circulating every year or 2/ where crypto experts question USDT’s legitimacy and predict its demise. These arguments usually center around 3 points: That Tether can’t be trusted because Tether Limited and crypto exchange Bitfinex allegedly attempted market manipulation in 2017 to create the bull run by artificially inflating prices or creating fake volume. That Tether isn’t collateralized in full by US Dollars at a 1:1 ratio/ but instead uses dubious assets whose value can’t always be accurately ascertained. That regulators want to shut Tether down and eventually will find the smoking gun to do so. While there is some merit in all these claims/ some of which previously caused Tether to depeg and will do so again in the case of a bank run. There’s no argument that Tether’s demise would be catastrophic for the crypto industry/ especially since USDC’s recent de-pegging. Of course/ Tether also experienced a drop to as low as 80c. Despite this/ the coin's stability has helped it to maintain its lead over competing stablecoins/ especially after showing its resilience in the aftermath of the collapse of UST/ an algorithmic stablecoin/ in mid-2022. However/ there's still a nagging worry that if USDT fails to retain a proper dollar peg/ it could cause a ripple effect with massive losses across the broader cryptocurrency market. Users would end up undercutting each other left and right to convert their holdings into different assets. Some analysts believe that if this scenario played out/ the fallout wouldn’t be as bad as we think. Regardless of these potential risks/ USDT remains a vital component of the larger crypto economy and is likely to continue to be so in the foreseeable future. Why Is Tether So Popular? Tether (USDT) has always been the first and largest stablecoin in the crypto space/ available as native tokens on all big layer-1 chains and nearing a record-high market capitalization of $80 billion at the time of writing. Tether Limited has had a variety of accusations regarding its business model but has claimed to be fully transparent and update its balances and reserves daily. Being such a popular stablecoin for the average degen trader and institutional investor/ Tether has become a convenient way to transfer money online. Tether (USDT) is widely available on nearly every major blockchain/ including Ethereum/ Kusama/ Polygon/ Liquid Network/ and recently Near Network. If you’re curious why someone would pay to bridge their USDT to different chains/ USDT gas fees on Ethereum depend on network activity/ while Polygon transfers are basically free/ consider this: If you’re beginning to experiment with DeFi or just want to bridge your safe assets between networks/ would you rather own Tether/ or a stablecoin exclusive to one blockchain? What Does Tether Do? Tether is a stablecoin designed to mitigate crypto market volatility by pegging its value to the US dollar. It serves as a link between cryptocurrencies and traditional fiat by being a static/ reliable/ digital store of value. Another important role of stablecoins is to prevent value loss in the time from when a transaction is initiated to when it is executed/ a situation referred to as slippage. Without a static currency/ there would be no way to ensure loan or liquidity providers that the currency they provide would be worth the same value when the loan is repaid. It would also be impractical for service providers to constantly update pricing information if the underlying currency price kept shifting. Why Did Tether Depeg? When Tether FUD is in full flow/ it has depegged from the dollar several times in the past/ both up and down/ depending on which exchange you look at and opening and closing prices. Here is a brief history of the most significant USDT depegs/ and the reasons behind them: How Do Tether Tokens Work? Stablecoins like Tether are crypto assets that are pegged 1:1 to fiat currencies like the US Dollar or Euro/ and backed by real-world assets in full by their issuing company. These reserves must be frequently attested or audited/ depending on their jurisdiction/ to ensure all stablecoins issued are fully collateralized and redeemable at all times. Tether ensures that USDT is available on almost all ecosystem chains as native tokens (such as Bitcoin’s OMNI layer/ Ethereum’s ERC20 standard/ BNB Chain’s BEP20/ Tron’s TRC20 etc) to maintain the stablecoin’s ubiquity in markets. The Chinese Yuan and Mexican Peso also have Tether-backed versions to assist other countries to enter the larger market. Why Use Tether? Tether enjoys liquidity on virtually every blockchain that accepts Tether tokens. Its widespread availability ensures that most crypto exchanges will pair their assets with USDT/ making them accessible to stablecoin holders. Without consistent pairing with a stablecoin like USDT/ traders could be limited in the cryptocurrencies they could purchase/ requiring them to swap stablecoins at a loss. For this reason/ a glance at the Tether market cap should give you an idea of which stablecoin is best to swap into between trades or to store value. By holding the most widely available and well-known stablecoin/ the odds are greater that your preferred exchange has a trading pair available to you. Lastly/ Tether has proven itself time and time again to be impervious against market conditions and regulatory scrutiny. With its base in crypto-friendly Hong Kong instead of the lately crypto-antagonistic United States/ it’s also better protected/ currently at least/ against the whims of politicians and regulators/ as the recent USDC depeg and BUSD suit showed. Tether History and Founders In the pioneering age of cryptocurrency/ Tether Limited's USDT emerged as a game-changer/ initially dubbed Realcoin back in 2014. The brilliant minds behind this innovation were none other than co-founders Brock Pierce/ Reeve Collins/ and Craig Sellars. A true entrepreneur at heart/ Brock Pierce/ dubbed “The hippie king of cryptocurrency” by Rolling Stone in 2018/ has left his mark on numerous high-profile projects in the crypto and entertainment spheres/ some of them controversially/ such as BlockOne’s EOS . As a co-founder of Blockchain Capital in 2013/ he played a pivotal role in raising over $150 million by 2017. With an impressive track record of co-founding successful ventures. Reeve Collins led Tether Limited as its CEO during the crucial first two years. His entrepreneurial prowess can be witnessed in his previous projects/ including RedLever/ an entertainment studio/ and Pala Interactive/ a gambling platform. Craig Sellars/ a versatile figure in the crypto world/ has been an integral part of the Omni Foundation for over six years. The foundation's innovative Omni Protocol empowers users to create and trade smart-contract-based properties and currencies atop Bitcoin's blockchain. Sellars' extensive experience spans various other crypto organizations and companies such as Bitfinex/ Factom/ Synereo/ and the MaidSafe Foundation/ showcasing his undeniable expertise in the field. FAQ How does Tether make money? Tether Limited generates revenue each time you deposit or redeem USDT tokens from their reserves. Assets held by Tether Limited are also partially invested in safe assets such as US bonds and precious metals or loaned out to other institutions. Does Tether lose or gain value? The value of USDT should not fluctuate much because it is supposed to be backed 1:1 by USD reserves held by Tether Limited. However/ there have been some instances where its value has fluctuated slightly. For example/ during periods of high demand/ USDT may trade slightly above its intended peg of 1 USD. Conversely/ during periods of low demand or when there are concerns about Tether's backing or transparency/ the price of Tether may drop slightly below its intended peg. Is Tether USDT a good investment? Being an asset-backed cryptocurrency stablecoin has made USDT a safe haven asset for poor market conditions. If your goal is to profit from cryptocurrency trading/ a more established currency such as Bitcoin will be a better bet on future financial gains. Can Tether Really work? As long as Tether Limited is able to maintain enough dollars in reserve and redeem institutional requests for fiat/ USDT coin will continue to trade at $1. Where can you buy Tether (USDT)? USDT tokens can be purchased on nearly all cryptocurrency markets including Binance/ Kraken/ Coinbase/ and many others. Why are hedge funds shorting Tether stablecoin? The idea of shorting a stablecoin may seem strange at first/ but some hedge funds have attempted to take advantage of industry-shaking events to earn a profit. Moments like the TerraUSD (UST) collapse and FTX implosion in 2022 had institutions praying for a chance to flood the market with unpegged Tether coins What determines Tether’s price? As long as Tether redemptions are processed/ the USDT price will remain $1. How do you cash out USDT tokens? USDT coins can be cashed out at any exchange that supports a pair with both USDT and your local currency. Tether Limited will process redemptions from their dollar reserves but only for corporate clients that meet specific criteria and refund their cash equivalent in their chosen fiat currency. Can you transfer USDT to a bank account? Once traded to your fiat currency of choice/ you can initiate a withdrawal to your bank account from your exchange. Exchanges typically require a withdrawal fee equal to a specified amount of USD. Can you spend USDT? USDT payments are possible in many places/ including cryptocurrency exchanges and even some retailers that accept it as a payment option. Be aware this will likely require a USDT transaction fee. How much is Tether's reserve? According to Tether’s transparency page/ Tether has over $85 billion in reserves. At the time of writing/ it has $85/661/782/823.14 in total assets and $83/218/992/302.62 in total liabilities. The majority of its reserves are invested in US treasury bills/ while gold and Bitcoin represent around 4% and 2% of the total reserves. There is a reserve surplus of $2.44 billion. Is there USDT mining? USDT cannot be mined. Tether issues USDT stablecoins by minting and issuing them to KYC-ed users on their official website. Users can also obtain USDT by trading through a cryptocurrency pair on an exchange. Could the value of USD Tether increase by +5% to 1.2586595 based on the forecasted value? It is theoretically possible for Tether to depeg upward/ but it is extremely unlikely/ as institutions would quickly redeem fiat dollars for Tether crypto to sell them until the peg was re-established. How Many Tether (USDT) Coins Are There In Circulation? The number of Tether (USDT) coins in circulation currently is 83/218/992/303. Tether holdings on each chain are updated daily.

Render Network's pricing model is dynamic and competitive/ taking into account job complexity/ urgency/ and available resources. Render distributes the job workload among available GPU providers across the peer-to-peer network of RNDR tokens/ incentivizing nodes to provide excess computing power. The platform has expanding use cases in artificial intelligence/ gaming/ and augmented reality. What Is Render Network? Render Network (RNDR) is a decentralized global rendering platform designed to address the growing demands for GPU computing power in next-generation media production. Render Network uses unused GPU cycles to connect content creators lacking computing power with GPU providers that have excess computing power. By putting these underutilized GPUs to use/ the project enables more efficient resource use and allows creators to access cost-effective GPU resources for their projects. The Render Network distributes GPU-based render jobs across a peer-to-peer network. This simplifies the process of rendering and streaming virtual content and makes it easier for users to interact with immersive 3D environments/ models and objects. RNDR tokens incentivize nodes to provide their excess computing power to the network. Use cases and applications for Render Network include visual effects and motion graphics/ virtual assets and non-fungible tokens (NFTs)/ virtual production/ as well as projection mapping/ product design/ architecture/ simulation and visualization. Render Network also has emerging applications in augmented reality/ gaming and artificial intelligence. How Does Render Network Work? Below is an overview of the technical functionality of the Render Network in the rendering process: Job Submission Content creators submit rendering jobs to the Render Network/ along with accompanying data and the required specifications. These jobs can include complex 3D scenes/ high-resolution images or videos/ simulations or other GPU-intensive tasks. Pricing Mechanism The Render Network uses a dynamic pricing model that takes into account variables such as the job's complexity/ urgency and available resources. This model ensures that content creators receive competitive rates for rendering services while compensating GPU providers fairly for their contributions. Job Distribution Once a job is submitted/ the network distributes the workload among available GPU providers. This can be based on factors such as GPU type/ capacity/ geographic location and provider reputation. A sophisticated matchmaking algorithm ensures that jobs are assigned to suitable providers/ maximizing efficiency and resource allocation. Processing and Verification Selected GPU providers process the assigned rendering tasks and generate the required outputs. A trustless validation system verifies the accuracy and completeness of the rendered outputs/ helping ensure that content creators receive high-quality results. Decentralized consensus algorithms/ like Proof of Render/ may also be used to safeguard the rendering process from malicious actors and potential errors or delays. Payment and Rewards Upon successful rendering and verification/ content creators pay GPU providers using Render tokens. Rewards are distributed based on the complexity of the tasks completed and resources contributed/ incentivizing participation and providing a fair remuneration system. Who Is Behind Render Network? Render Network was created by an experienced team of professionals from the 3D graphics and blockchain sectors. The founder and CEO is Jules Urbach/ who is also the founder and CEO of OTOY/ a cloud graphics company providing rendering solutions for Hollywood studios and artists. The core team further includes Kalin Stoyanchev as the Head of Blockchain/ Joshua Bijak as the Project Lead/ Charlie Wallace as the Chief Technology Officer/ Phillip Gara as the Director of Strategy/ and Jayson Kleinman as the Head of Business Development. Render Network is also supported by figures in the entertainment and technology industries/ such as Ari Emanuel/ the CEO of Endeavor/ a global media and entertainment company; J.J. Abrams/ the chairman and many others. What Makes Render Network Unique? The following aspects set Render Network apart from comparable projects and solutions: Decentralized/ Peer-to-Peer Rendering The Render Network harnesses the power of decentralized GPU resources from a vast ecosystem of providers. This allows content creators to access high-quality rendering services in a trustless environment/ eliminating the need for centralized rendering farms/ and promoting efficient allocation of GPU power across multiple users. Dynamic Pricing Model Render Network’s dynamic pricing mechanism ensures competitive service costs for content creators and fair compensation for GPU providers. The pricing model takes into account factors like job complexity/ urgency and resource availability to determine the optimal cost for rendering services. Rather than relying on static or manual pricing systems/ its dynamic approach adapts to the needs of its user base and ecosystem. Advanced Matchmaking Algorithm The Render Network employs an advanced matchmaking algorithm to connect content creators with suitable GPU providers. By assessing factors like GPU type/ capacity/ location and provider reputation/ the Render Network ensures that rendering jobs are effectively distributed across resources/ maximizing the efficiency/ speed and cost-effectiveness of the rendering services. Trustless Validation and Security Security and accurate results are crucial aspects of any rendering platform. Render Network uses trustless validation mechanisms to verify the accuracy and completeness of rendered outputs/ ensuring high-quality results for content creators. Decentralized consensus algorithms/ like Proof of Render/ aims to offer additional layers of security that guard against malicious actors and potential errors or delays in the rendering process. Render Network Tokenomics RNDR is the native token of Render Network that serves multiple purposes: RNDR serves as the utility token for on-demand GPU rendering services. Creators pay for rendering jobs with RNDR. They can access a variety of GPU providers with different levels of speed/ security and price. Currently/ there are hree tiers of pricing: Tier 1 (Trusted Partners)/ Tier 2 (Priority)/ and Tier 3 (Economy). Tier 2 and Tier 3 are available/ Tier 1 will be launched in the future. Second/ it is used as the reward mechanism for GPU providers. Node Operators can use their idle GPU power to render jobs on the Render Network and earn RNDR tokens in return. The amount of RNDR tokens they earn depends on the rendering job's tier/ duration and complexity. Node operators can also stake their RNDR tokens to increase their reputation and access more rendering jobs. Third/ RNDR is the protocol’s governance token/ allowing token holders to influence the governance of the Render Network. At the time of writing/ Render token has a max supply of 536/870/912 RNDR tokens and a circulating supply of 366/385/484 RNDR. The token distribution is as follows: 40% for network development 25% for network growth 20% for network operations 10% for network reserve 5% for network genesis This article contains links to third-party websites or other content for information purposes only (“Third-Party Sites”).

Discover how to review crypto protocols, analyze tokenomics, assess valuations and more with AI tools.","title":"How To Use ChatGPT for Crypto Research | CoinMarketCap","detailedContent":"While the free version of ChatGPT is powered by GPT-3.5/ the premium version (ChatGPT Plus) is powered by GPT-4. This is a far more powerful model with additional features/ several of which are particularly useful for crypto research. For example/ GPT-4 can: 1. Browse the internet 2. Support up to 25/000 word inputs 3. Multi-modal capabilities 4. Priority access For light research/ the free version of ChatGPT will likely suffice for most users. But for those looking to perform in-depth research with the latest data/ ChatGPT Plus is a worthwhile splurge. Remember/ ChatGPT isn’t always accurate/ and should not be used for direct financial advice. Let's take a look some of the things ChatGPT could do as a crypto research analyst. Subscribe Join us in showcasing the cryptocurrency revolution/ one newsletter at a time. Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox/ along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right/ millions love us!) — what are you waiting for? Summarize New Projects Arguably ChatGPT’s most powerful feature is its ability to summarize information and extrapolate the key insights from the text and data it is provided. This can help you take potentially in-depth and complex pieces of text/ such as whitepapers/ blog posts/ and wiki entries/ and simplify the most important information. Furthermore/ you can tell ChatGPT to take on the role of a professional financial analyst specializing in cryptocurrencies. Or present itself as a degen trader that specializes in meme coins and short-term investments. Perform Fundamental Analysis Many cryptocurrency traders and investors are interested in the fundamental strength of a project/ looking at the intrinsic factors that can affect its value and long-term viability — such as its disruptive potential/ product/market fit/ unique selling points and competitive advantages. This can be a time consuming process/ typically requiring you to aggregate information from multiple sources/ cross-reference data/ and make judgments about multiple key points. Fortunately/ ChatGPT can be used to drastically simplify this process/ helping you arrive at your conclusions much faster. By prompting ChatGPT to play the role of a seasoned fundamental analyst/ you can tease out insights that you might otherwise gloss over. Evaluate Tokenomics and Governance Model A project’s tokenomics is crucial for investors to understand the supply and demand of the token. By analyzing a project's token supply/ emission schedule/ utility/ demand/ distribution and governance/ ChatGPT can provide valuable insights into a project's potential value and prospects over the long-term. ChatGPT can also help evaluate a project's governance model. By asking specific questions and providing relevant data/ ChatGPT can offer a deeper understanding of a project's treasury management/ decision-making processes and more. Now/ let's get into the steps on how to use ChatGPT for crypto research. Step 0: Getting Started with ChatGPT You have to set the stage for ChatGPT to achieve the maximum results. Example: View post on Twitter You can also copy and paste relevant whitepapers/ documents or project information into the ChatGPT window. GPT4 and other AI assistants with browsing capabilities can also read links. By doing this/ ChatGPT can browse the provided resources to gather information and generate meaningful analysis. Remember/ better data input will result in more relevant/ reliable and advanced insights. Step 1: Review Crypto Protocols with ChatGPT Gaining a solid grasp of a project's fundamentals and the underlying protocols is crucial to conducting effective crypto research. To maximize the benefits of ChatGPT/ ask specific questions to obtain the essential information tailored to your research goals. Problem and Solution Start by understanding the main problem a project aims to solve and how the solution it proposes. Targeted prompts allow ChatGPT to provide a clear and concise analysis of the project's core objectives. Example prompt: \"What's the problem that crypto project X aims to solve/ and how does it propose to address this issue?\" Technology and Protocols ChatGPT can also help you comprehend intricate technical concepts by providing explanations in simple terms. You can also ask for examples to further clarify the mechanics of a project. Example prompt: \"Explain how blockchain X’s consensus mechanism works/ and provide an example of how it helps maintain the network's security.\" Team Background and Experience The expertise and previous experiences of project founders and core members can provide insight into the project's potential for success. Prepare prompts to gather information about the team members and their relevant experience in the field. Example prompt: \"Provide an overview of the team behind crypto project X/ highlighting their skills and accomplishments in the cryptocurrency space.\" Step 2: Analyze Tokenomics with ChatGPT ChatGPT can effectively analyze a project's tokenomics and provide you with the necessary insights. Token Supply and Emission Schedule To form an educated opinion on a project's potential market value/ it's essential to understand the token's total supply/ circulating supply and emission schedule. Example prompt: \"What's the total supply/ circulating supply/ and the emission schedule for X token?\" Token Utility and Demand Tokens can have various use cases/ such as governance/ staking or providing access to platform services. ChatGPT can help you conveniently delve into the different utilities associated with a project's tokens. Example prompt: \"How does the X token function within its ecosystem? What are its main use cases and factors driving its demand?\" Token Distribution and Governance A fair and transparent token distribution may prevent centralization and other potential issues. Example prompt: \"How are the tokens for project X distributed/ and do they play a role in the governance of the project?\" Step 3: Assess Community Engagement and Development Activity with ChatGPT Market sentiment and community engagement are crucial factors since the hype around a project is at least as important as its fundamentals/ if not more so. ChatGPT can help you analyze a project’s media presence (if it has browsing capabilities). Social Media Presence Strong social media activity is key to an engaged audience and future growth potential. You can ask ChatGPT to research the project's social media profiles and evaluate its presence across various platforms. Example prompt: \"Provide a summary of the social media presence for project X/ detailing its size and engagement on platforms like Twitter/ Reddit/ and Telegram.\" Development Activity Continuous development is a positive sign for the project's commitment to delivering its goals. To evaluate a project's development activity/ you can ask ChatGPT to analyze its GitHub repository or other sources that showcase the team's progress. Example prompt: \"Summarize the development activity for project X/ including the frequency of commits and the overall size of its codebase on GitHub.\" Media Coverage and Partnerships Media coverage and strategic partnerships with investors can significantly impact a project's market sentiment and credibility. Well-established partnerships can boost the adoption and integration of a project's technology. Example prompt: \"List any notable partnerships/ collaborations and media coverage involving crypto project X.\" Step 4: Analyze Governance Model with ChatGPT Protocol governance influences the long-term success and sustainability of cryptocurrency projects. ChatGPT can help you analyze a project's governance system and understand the power of whales and how centralized a project is. Example prompt: \"Explain the role of on-chain and off-chain governance in project X and how they influence its decision-making processes and token holder participation.\" Step 5: Value a Crypto Protocol with ChatGPT Financial metrics/ such as total value locked (TVL)/ circulating market cap/ fully diluted market cap and generated fees/revenue can provide insights into a project's performance and investment potential. ChatGPT can analyze these metrics/ offering a deeper understanding of the project's financial standing. You can provide ChatGPT with the data from analytics tools to value a protocol. Example prompt: \"Based on the numbers provided for token X/ analyze whether it is a good investment.\" Conclusion ChatGPT and other AI assistants like Bard and Bing can help you save a lot of time doing your crypto research. You can also learn how to Trade Crypto Using AI. This article contains links to third-party websites or other content for information purposes only (“Third-Party Sites”).

One of Crypto’s Most Controversial Projects | CoinMarketCap","detailedContent":"Pulsechain and its sister project/ HEX/ are the brainchild of Richard Heart/ an internet marketer. They are also some of the most controversial blockchain projects around. This article will explain: What Pulsechain is and how it works. Who Richard Heart is. The Pulsechain tokenomics. The controversy around Pulsechain. Subscribe Join us in showcasing the cryptocurrency revolution/ one newsletter at a time. Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox/ along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right/ millions love us!) — what are you waiting for? What Is Pulsechain and How Does It Work? Pulsechain is a layer-1 blockchain created by Richard Heart/ the founder of HEX. Pulsechain raised billions of dollars in an initial coin offering (ICO)/ or what it termed a \"sacrifice/\" to improve upon Ethereum's value proposition. It claims to enrich ETH users by giving them a free copy of their tokens and NFTs on the Pulse network. Pulsechain also claimed to be more environmental-friendly than Ethereum/ although that point has been irrelevant since Ethereum’s switch to proof-of-stake. Pulsechain took a snapshot of the Ethereum system state and replicated it on a new network with some modifications. The new network has a native token called PLS/ which can be used to activate validators/ pay for transactions/ and bridge to other chains. Pulsechain boasted about having a faster block time of 10 seconds instead of 12 seconds on Ethereum. To get PLS tokens/ users had to participate in a sacrifice phase/ where they could donate any cryptocurrency or fiat currency to a list of supported addresses or charities. The more they sacrificed/ the more PLS they received. Pulsechain also launched its own decentralized exchange called PulseX/ which is similar to Uniswap. PulseX allows users to swap any ERC-20 token or NFT on the Pulse network and also burns a portion of the fees to reduce the supply of PLS over time. It also had its own sacrifice phase/ where users could get PLSX tokens by sacrificing PLS or other cryptocurrencies. Both Pulsechain and PusleX saw $11 billion of HEX locked up during the \"sacrifice.\" Pulsechain is currently live on the mainnet. Users can access Pulsechain by changing their MetaMask settings to connect to the Pulse RPC endpoint. They can also use the PulseScan block explorer to view their balances and transactions on the Pulse network. Who Is Behind Pulsechain? The founder of Pulsechain is Richard Heart/ an infamous figure in the crypto industry. He claims to be an entrepreneur/ author/ YouTuber and philanthropist. Richard Heart is also the founder of HEX/ an ERC-20 token on Ethereum. Richard Heart is a self-made millionaire who started his career as an internet marketer. He later moved on to create several successful online businesses/ such as a search engine optimization company/ a dating website and a Bitcoin hardware wallet. He also wrote a book called SciVive/ which teaches people how to live longer and happier lives. Richard Heart has been a vocal critic of the inefficiencies and limitations of the Ethereum network/ which he believes is holding back the innovation and adoption of decentralized applications. He claims Pulsechain is a solution to these problems/ as it forks Ethereum to improve its speed and scalability. Pulsechain Tokenomics The native token of Pulsechain is PLS/ which can be used to activate validators/ pay for transactions and bridge to other chains. PLS has a fixed supply of four trillion tokens/ which were distributed through a sacrifice phase/ where users could donate any cryptocurrency or fiat currency to a list of supported addresses or charities in exchange for PLS tokens. The sacrifice phase ended on August 22/ 2021/ and raised over $700 million for medical research and other causes. PLS has some features that aim to make it different from other tokens/ such as: PLS is deflationary and Pulsechain burns a portion of the transaction fees paid in PLS/ reducing the supply of PLS over time. Pulsechain implements EIP-1559/ which means that every transaction on the network has a base fee that is burned and a tip that goes to the validator. PLS is freemium. ETH holders can transact for free with freemium PLS. This means that every ETH address that existed at the time of the fork received a free copy of its ETH balance in PLS on the Pulse network. These freemium PLS can only be used to pay for transactions and cannot be transferred or sold. This allows ETH users to enjoy the benefits of Pulsechain without sacrificing their ETH. Pulsechain uses proof-of-stake as its consensus mechanism/ which means that users can stake their PLS tokens to activate validators and earn rewards for helping to secure the network. Users need at least 32 million PLS to become a validator/ or they can join a staking pool with other users. Validators are randomly selected to propose and attest blocks/ and they receive rewards based on their stake and performance. The Controversy Around Pulsechain Not everyone is convinced by Pulsechain's promises and benefits. Some critics have accused Pulsechain and its founder of being involved in a ponzi scheme/ a pyramid scheme or a pump-and-dump scheme. Below are some of the main arguments against Pulsechain. Dubious Launch Pulsechain's launch involved a sacrifice phase. In exchange for PLS tokens/ users could donate cryptocurrency or fiat currency to charities that Pulsechain supports. The sacrifice phase raised over $700 million for medical research and other causes. However/ some critics argue that the sacrifice phase was a clever way to avoid legal issues and regulations by not offering any guarantees or expectations for the donors. They also claim that the sacrifice phase was a way to enrich Richard Heart and his associates/ who could manipulate the supply and demand of PLS tokens. Buggy Mainnet Pulsechain's network is not fully functional or secure yet. It is still in beta testing and has faced several technical issues and bugs. For example/ on May 24/ 2023/ the price of wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) on Pulsechain spiked from $27/000 to $70/000 in just 20 minutes/ only to fall back 10 minutes later. This volatility revealed Pulsechain's low liquidity. View post on Twitter Controversial Founder Pulsechain's founder Richard Heart is one of the most controversial figures in crypto. He has been accused of being involved in a spam-related scheme in 2002/ which went to trial. Doubtful Track Record Pulsechain's sister project HEX has minimal use cases and value propositions. HEX is designed to be a high-interest blockchain certificate of deposit/ where users can stake their tokens for a fixed period of time and earn interest. However/ some critics argue that HEX is nothing more than a Ponzi scheme/ where the interest payments are funded by new entrants and inflation. They also claim that HEX has no real utility or innovation and it only benefits Richard Heart and his affiliates/ who hold a large portion of the supply. These are some points of controversy around Pulsechain and its founder. Of course/ there are also many supporters and fans of Pulsechain who believe in its vision and potential. To them/ Pulsechain is a legitimate project that aims to improve Ethereum's performance and user experience while supporting good causes. Launch Problems The Pulsechain launch got off to a bumpy start/ according to a Protos report. HEX was already plagued with several problems/ such as inaccessible funds and SEC subpoenas. That did not discourage fervent HEXicans/ but the Pulsechain launch may be yet another low blow to Richard Heart’s grandiose plans. According to Protos/ the May 13 launch was a disappointment due to no major exchange listings/ expensive transaction fees and dozens of fake versions of PLS. The report outlines how Pulse sacrificers were bleeding value on their locked tokens while not being able to bridge away from the chain. Meanwhile/ over-the-counter dealers charged excessive prices for dumping locked tokens. The article speculates that the situation may not impact Richard Heart’s wealth/ as he is rumored to have made a fortune on the raised ETH alone. In response to rumors of him selling the raised ETH/ the article quotes Heart: “No comment/ Tone. I got a lot of really cool stuff. I’m selling something for it/ ain’t I?” Conclusion Pulsechain is a controversial project with a large following and a great number of doubters. The former claim that Pulsechain will revolutionize decentralized applications while the latter consider it a scam. Users that want to invest in Pulsechain should treat it with caution and DYOR.

And by crypto we mean scams and rug-pulls in crypto. Plenty of those around last week/ so without further ado/ let’s visit the seedy underbelly of the crypto industry: Crypto Twitter. Whose Threads Are a Must-Read? As an avid reader of the round-up/ you’ll know that last week’s edition covered Andrew Tate’s rant on crypto. But what you may not have caught is what prompted Tate to rant: Ben.eth/ the account behind the PSYOP token. If you don’t know who the heck Ben.eth is and what is going on/ Jack Niewold has you covered: View post on Twitter In short/ Ben.eth is also behind BEN. This one is really worth reading because it gives a good sneak peek into the fishy business of influencers and how they abuse their followers. View post on Twitter To celebrate this memorial weekend/ Ben.eth launched his third token yet/ $LOYAL. It's all getting real tiresome. Memecoins are a nice way of making some money though/ especially in bull markets. You just have to know when to long and when to take profit/ right? Well/ Inuito’s answer to those two questions is “asap” and “never.” Check out this thread on how to ride bull markets to generational wealth: View post on Twitter Some interesting and you could even say contrarian advice in there. There were also a couple of interesting threads on potential future narratives. For instance/ Dinero is a decentralized stablecoin that is tipped to become a big thing in the next run. The DeFi Edge interviewed the founder of Redacted Cartel/ the protocol behind Dinero: View post on Twitter The DeFi market is still weak compared to its peak/ but the bottom is probably in and the time to learn about DeFi is now. Then there was some controversy around the proposed Uniswap fee switch proposal. If that flew completely over your head/ Sandra covers all the important facts in this thread: View post on Twitter The proposal could funnel some of the fees back to token holders/ which could be bullish for the token. Another DeFi development worth keeping an eye on. Finally/ if DeFi and memecoins are not your thing/ you could stick to L1s to make money. But which one should you buy? Solana was the hot stuff in the last bull run. What about now? Funny enough/ Crypto Twitter served up one bullish SOL thread and one bearish SOL thread last week. Here’s the bull thesis: User TPS will be a major driver of SOL's valuation. SOL can become one of the most expensive assets in the world. SOL is increasingly becoming the home for high-touch use cases. View post on Twitter Resident threadooor Adam Cochran answered with the bear thesis on Solana: Security is expensive and Ethereum is expensive because it is the settlement for what really matters. Other chains can capture their own unique markets/ but many have failed to do so and instead focus on building faster horses. Different protocols need to exist for different layers in order to maximize security/ distribution/ and cost. View post on Twitter Wisdom Of The Week Santiago R Santos with a pinpoint definition of how to win at investing: View post on Twitter Who Is Arguing in Way Too Public a Place? Bringing back the drama section/ which could just as well be named “who is scamming in way too public a place?” There were several dumpster fires last week. Let’s start with Ben.eth who retweeted a phishing account and lost his followers money: View post on Twitter To keep the record completely straight/ Ben did refund the people who got scammed out of money because of the retweet. But that wasn’t the only shady business happening last week. Rollbit/ another patron of the drama section/ was back with a vengeance last week as well. People still aren’t buying that Rollbit is playing a completely clean game: View post on Twitter So Gainzy got the crypto main character role again for a brief while last week. A little spat about the allegedly excessive Rollbit fees turned into an all-out brawl last week: View post on Twitter Even though the memecoin trading has been winding down a bit the last weeks/ it’s every man for himself out there in this crab market. The last word has probably not been spoken yet on those… Elon Building Twitter Elon Musk’s week was no less eventful. He announced that Ron De Santis would announce throwing his hat in the campaign ring for the Republican Presidential nomination on a Twitter space. Predictably/ that made huge weeks. Not so predictably (or even more so/ depending on your POV)/ the actual Twitter space turned out to be quite glitchy/ as the servers tried to cope with the demand. But that didn’t discourage Musk one bit. Any attention is good attention/ as they say: View post on Twitter The only thing that could make Twitter more dramatic would be…uhh/ Donald Trump returning to Twitter? Oh boy/ things are about to become weird again. Talk of the Town Loads of interesting talk last week. How about the new Vitalik Buterin blog post that Ethereum’s consensus mechanism should not get overloaded: View post on Twitter Too much reliance on Ethereum could indeed introduce centralization risks/ as Bankless also correctly analyzed. But also the Bitcoin space had plenty of interesting developments going on last week. Michael Saylor is bullish on BRC-20 tokens: View post on Twitter And elsewhere/ Bitcoiners tried their earnest to gain an entry to the drama section. Here are Udi Wertheimer and Eric Wall doing an/ ahem/ dance at the Bitcoin conference: View post on Twitter That was not to everyone’s liking in the community/ though: View post on Twitter Every L1 has its own telenovela. Welcome to crypto. In terms of “actual news/” there was the delay of the Ledger Recover feature/ which generated a lot of controversy. And there was the comeback of crypto in China. And mind you/ not just any comeback. We’re talking front-row/ mainstream news-type of stuff: View post on Twitter Not financial advice but a big potential driver for the future. And last but not least/ Multichain was just the latest crypto actor to be caught in the crosshairs of law enforcement (this time in China): View post on Twitter That could spell bad news for a couple of layer-one chains. Namely those with big exposure: View post on Twitter Really just your average week in crypto/ isn’t it? Our Favorite Coinfession Your threador writes 26 tweet-threads on trading alpha. My guy has real-world trading alpha. We are not the same: View post on Twitter Memes You really need to pay attention to what kind of on-chain detective you choose to believe: View post on Twitter That’s all for this week folks.

FTX 2.0 sounded like a joke ─ until it wasn’t. A restart of the failed FTX exchange could be in the making. As much has been confirmed by a document showing the new FTX CEO John Ray III billing for work around several FTX 2.0 items: View post on Twitter But who exactly is in favor of an FTX 2.0 launch? Why would someone support re-launching a failed crypto exchange? And is this even a viable idea to make customers whole? Let’s address all of those questions. What Is FTX 2.0 and How Would It Work? This is John Ray III/ the new CEO of FTX that has been in charge of cleaning up the mess left behind by Sam Bankman-Fried: View post on Twitter By the way/ he led the efforts to recover creditors’ assets after Enron collapsed. Talk about experience. He first hinted at re-opening FTX a couple of months ago. With the hole in the balance sheet having shrunk to “only” $6.8 billion/ a re-launch was being explored as an alternative path to making customers whole more quickly. Since liquidation proceedings can take up to several years/ leveraging whatever expertise is left to run the exchange could be an alternative. What started as a thought experiment grew legs over the recent months. So much so that a “FTX 2.0 Coalition” formed around the plan: View post on Twitter Loomdart/ one of the major key opinion leaders in the crypto space/ is one of the supporting forces behind the plan: View post on Twitter He explained that launching FTX 2.0 would be the best way of getting (his own) money back. And it would be a way of getting back at Sam Bankman-Fried for recovering customer funds back without his involvement: View post on Twitter But how would FTX 2.0 work? It turns out that nothing was wrong with FTX the exchange. In fact/ it was profitable: View post on Twitter The problem was FTX’s leadership and its habit to use customer money for the adjacent Alameda fund to gamble on the markets. Moreover/ as the “coalition” argues/ Binance’s de-facto market monopoly means another exchange could innovate and grab some of its market share. And with Bitfinex/ there is a precedent of a fallen exchange having made customers whole again: View post on Twitter It seems there are good reasons to support the FTX 2.0 launch. But is the crypto space equally sanguine about this turn of events? Read also: Everything We Know About the FTX Saga So Far Can FTX 2.0 Really Work? Some in the space support the idea of launching debt claims on the new FTX 2.0 exchange to let creditors sort the claims out themselves: View post on Twitter However/ not everyone is on the same page. Flood seems to think that a restructuring would actually return customer money faster: View post on Twitter However/ with possible bankruptcy proceedings taking five to ten years/ such as in the Madoff case/ a successful re-launch of FTX could plug the hole faster. But would it be successful? For one/ the reputation of FTX is severely tarnished. How much a re-launch under credible management would help remains to be seen. Furthermore/ spot exchange volumes have been declining over the last few months/ meaning it could be significantly more difficult for the exchange to make as much money as it used to do: View post on Twitter Finally/ the United States Government may want to get paid out first. The IRS filed a claim of $44 billion in missing tax revenue. It’s unclear how that is to be resolved. It remains to be seen whether FTX 2.0 will really see the light.

Challenges and Accusations The crypto industry in the United States has faced a series of obstacles in recent times: Lawsuits on several fronts Denied applications General animosity towards the industry For instance/ Protego Trust/ a digital asset firm/ was denied a national trust charter by the OCC despite having met the necessary requirements and investing $80 million in regulatory capital. The company has been significantly impacted by this denial/ forcing it to lay off most of its staff and leaving its future uncertain. Unsurprisingly/ the company felt unfairly treated: View post on Twitter Operation Choke Point 2.0 The crypto industry has accused federal bank regulators of purposefully restricting access to the banking system for digital asset firms. Nic Carter dubbed this treatment \"Operation Choke Point 2.0\" — a reference to a past problematic initiative that targeted certain industries like firearms dealers and payday lenders/ believed to be of high risk for fraud and money laundering. Carter alleged in a blog post that regulators are considering using choke points to control the cryptocurrency industry and prevent collapses like the recent FTX debacle. By limiting access to fiat currency/ regulators want to marginalize the industry and avoid direct regulation. This crackdown is happening publicly through rulemaking and written guidance/ instead of backdoor conversations like in the past. The current approach is being marketed as \"safety and soundness\" and the regulators are dissuading banks from doing business with crypto. SEC Crackdown on Crypto Companies The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has ramped up its focus on the crypto industry since October 2020/ charging and warning digital asset companies almost weekly. This intense scrutiny has left the industry at a point of crisis/ as many companies find themselves struggling to meet heightened regulatory demands which have/ in some cases/ significantly hindered their operations. Even though SEC Chairman Gary Gensler claimed clear rules for the industry already exist/ companies like Coinbase beg to differ. Coinbase is fighting back against the SEC by filing a lawsuit of its own. Regulatory Counter Arguments The regulatory authorities in the United States have come forward to address the allegations put forth by the cryptocurrency industry/ emphasizing that their actions aim to balance risk management and consumer protection rather than deliberately targeting crypto businesses. Regulatory bodies such as the SEC/ OCC and CFTC have countered the accusations by the crypto industry/ maintaining that they are focused on managing risks related to cryptocurrencies rather than targeting the industry specifically. Adrienne Harris/ superintendent of the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) called the allegations “ludicrous.” She refuted accusations that the department trying to eliminate crypto businesses in the United States/ offering alternative explanations for the closure of Signature Bank: “The idea that taking possession of Signature was about crypto/ or that this is Choke Point 2.0 is really ludicrous. I mean/ I just have no other way to say it – what we saw was a new-fashioned bank run. When you have a high percentage of uninsured deposits/ and you don’t have liquidity management protocols in place/ you end up in a place where you cannot open on Monday in a safe and sound manner.” According to the NYDFS/ the closure of Signature Bank was primarily due to poor management and a lack of understanding of the risks involved in serving crypto businesses/ rather than being part of a hidden agenda aimed at eradicating the industry. The Role of Larger Banks Despite the ongoing challenges and regulatory scrutiny faced by the cryptocurrency industry in the United States/ there are indications that larger banks are starting to reconsider their stance on digital assets. JPMorgan Chase/ one of the largest banking institutions in the United States/ has recently begun providing banking services to well-established cryptocurrency exchanges/ such as Coinbase and Gemini. Citi/ another major financial institution/ has also expressed interest in extending services to cryptocurrency businesses and has been actively researching the potential of digital assets within the traditional financial ecosystem. These decisions by top-tier banking institutions suggest a potential change in attitude and growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies in the banking sector. This could signal increased support for the crypto industry within the traditionally conservative banking sector and lead to further expansion and integration between the banking and cryptocurrency ecosystems. It may also lay the groundwork for improved dialog and cooperation with regulatory authorities to help shape more inclusive and supportive policies for crypto businesses in the United States. The Effects on Crypto Companies The uncertain regulatory landscape in the United States has had a significant impact on cryptocurrency companies operating within its borders. Coinbase has reportedly been exploring an international move to mitigate regulatory concerns and hindrances in the United States. This relocation highlights the increasing pressure on US-based crypto firms grappling with the evolving and complex regulatory environment. Other cryptocurrency companies in the US continue to face various challenges as they navigate the ever-changing regulatory landscape. The federal bank regulators' crackdown on crypto firms may drive more exchanges and their customers to offshore banks in Puerto Rico/ Bermuda/ and the Bahamas/ aggravating risks and harm to the financial system. On the other hand/ the companies that choose to remain in the United States may have to endure significant hurdles in their operations/ including limitations on their access to crucial banking services or being forced to comply with a constantly shifting regime of rules and guidelines. Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie/ founder and CEO of crypto banking firm BCB Group/ called the situation “the SEC's chemotherapy for a giant gap/ for a $14 billion Ponzi cancer.” This shifting landscape suggests that the future of the US cryptocurrency industry remains uncertain. Congressional Hearings and Legal Actions The US Congress and judiciary are becoming increasingly involved in the discussion surrounding cryptocurrency regulations. A recent Congressional hearing featured testimony from SEC Chairman Gary Gensler and made crypto proponents happy/ as Gensler struggled to clarify his position: View post on Twitter Other hearings have summoned numerous cryptocurrency executives/ who presented their perspectives on the challenges and opportunities associated with the industry. On the legal side of things/ Protego/ a cryptocurrency firm/ has filed a lawsuit against the Federal Reserve alleging irregularities and unequal treatment in the bank charter application process. This legal action/ as well as the lawsuit Coinbase filed against the SEC/ signals broader discontent among crypto firms/ as well as the will and means to fight back. The legislative and judicial branches in the United States are increasingly paying attention to regulatory issues surrounding the cryptocurrency industry/ which could lead to changes in the regulatory landscape in the form of new laws. The Future of Crypto in the US — a Third Crypto War? Would it be justified to call this a “Third Crypto War?” That depends on who you ask. For instance/ Rob Leshner/ founder of Compound Labs/ recognized the concerted effort and bemoaned the lack of mainstream legal infrastructure for the industry to interact with the banking system. He said: “The map was wiped clean in an incredibly short amount of time due to government action in an unanticipated way…There’s an effort to de-bank crypto and it’s been – unfortunately – incredibly effective.” Mike Novogratz struck a similar tone. The CEO of Galaxy Digital sees a “widespread crackdown” against the industry. At the same time/ he remains hopeful the “system of checks and balances” in the form of the judiciary will reign in potential overreach by the regulatory authorities. But not everyone is bearish on crypto in the United States. Lou Kerner of the Crypto Oracle Collective called the regulatory crackdown “blatantly illegal” but also “irrelevant in the long run.” While that may drive crypto overseas in the short run/ he remains hopeful “the U.S. will get its crypto act together.” He called on the industry to #BUIDL/ a rallying cry for focusing on new products and services instead of becoming bogged down by political fights. Ultimately/ it may depend on the industry itself whether it can strike a compromise with politicians. There is certainly something to be said for a crackdown on crypto companies — and even more so on those that have been following the alleged rules like Coinbase. On the other hand/ even crypto advocates cannot deny that the fallout from the collapse of FTX and several big funds in 2022 did not spread to other industries. That indicates the existing ties between crypto and the traditional financial system were already weak/ and authorities are trying to isolate crypto altogether. While that may not be to the liking of crypto companies/ one can see the logic behind it/ especially considering the ongoing banking crisis. While this may not be a full-blown “Third Crypto War” yet/ it increasingly looks like a “Cold War” between US regulators and the industry. Check out the first crypto war/ which occurred in the early days of the internet where privacy advocates battled against government agencies.

Tate went after Crypto Twitter this week/ but you better check for yourself what he had to say… View post on Twitter Needless to say this generated a ton of attention (just as planned). We’ll get to the reactions later/ but first some more educational stuff… Whose Threads Are a Must-Read? Threads are like good [redacted]: one week you don’t have enough of them and the next you cannot keep up physically because it’s so much. The latter was the case this week/ but one of the threads that really stood out was Loround’s list of smaller accounts that share alpha: View post on Twitter Smaller accounts don’t get enough credit on Twitter/ and the list has an account for every niche. Thread king Adam Cochran graced us with a new thread (only 25!) this week about the future of ETH staking: View post on Twitter His takeaway? ETH is a great investment because it’s a productive asset (yield incoming from ponzis)/ so it has plenty of upside. The thread is quite technical/ but the short version is “ape ETH responsibly.” If you don’t have capital to ape ETH/ that is probably because you haven’t made it in the bull and have to survive the bear now. Duh. But fear not/ Zero Ika has you covered: View post on Twitter Here are a couple of his best tips: Improve technical analysis skills. Develop a skill to build income streams. Keep an eye on new narratives. Bet on builders who are still active and delivering during the bear market. Check the thread for the rest and get prepared for a wild bull market in the not-too-distant future. Zak posted another great thread about ERC-6551. You don’t know what ERC-6551 does? NFT wallets/ baby! Check it out: View post on Twitter And if you’re really clueless/ there is a complete explainer article about ERC-6551 on Academy. Last but not least/ since Bitcoin is now actually being used/ the Bitcoin FOMO is moving ahead with no breaks on the train. According to this thread/ every Ethereum opportunity is coming to Bitcoin/ too: View post on Twitter Whether that will actually happen… remains to be seen. But it’s worth keeping an eye on the opportunities popping up on Bitcoin. Wisdom of the Week The thread section was strong last week/ and so was the wisdom section. Sometimes it is easy to get carried away by chasing numbers and forget how risky your investments are. A good reminders from Route2Fi on that: View post on Twitter So how can you make it without taking too much risk? Stay intellectually curious: View post on Twitter Ok/ enough with the high-IQ stuff. Here comes the drama (and a lot of it). Elon Building Twitter Elon had his hands full last week with fighting on all fronts. After he announced Linda Yaccarino as the new CEO the week before/ he went straight back to sparring with some of the biggest names on the platform. The offending object was the election in Turkey. Twitter got accused of throttling some accounts at the behest of the Turkish government and put out the following statement: View post on Twitter But Elon Musk was not impressed by how political commentator Matt Iglesias implied Twitter is engaging in censorship: View post on Twitter According to Elon/ Twitter pushes harder for free speech than “Wokipedia.” But it got even spicier when Elon picked a fight with billionaire George Soros: View post on Twitter This did not sit well with certain governments or factions of the establishment. Several media outlets questioned whether Musk’s statements were antisemitic/ and the Israeli government was not exactly amused either: View post on Twitter Now imagine how much fun Twitter will be in 12 months from now with the US election coming up. Buckle up… Talk of the Town The two main topics last week were hardware wallets and memecoins. Nothing unusual/ in other words. Ledger start a huge discussion by announcing its “Ledger Recover” social recovery feature/ which was interpreted as “Ledger can access your seed phrase.” View post on Twitter The culprit was the following deleted tweet from a Ledger rep. Can’t really say the reaction is surprising when you tweet out something like this: So obviously/ most of Crypto Twitter departed the sinking Ledger hardware wallet ship: View post on Twitter The company later tried to set the record straight in a tweet thread by its CTO/ which assured users it’s all fine: View post on Twitter Whether that will really calm the masses…well. You know how it goes in crypto. You either die a hero or live long enough to become the villain. Ledger has the hardware “main character” role now/ so let’s see when it can pass it on. And then there was Tate. Although he isn’t exactly universally well-liked around crypto circles/ reactions were mostly positive: And you can’t exactly disagree with almost all of what Tate says. Yes/ most community building is a psyop. Yes/ many tokens have 0 utility or added value. Yes/ crypto attracts gambling addicts that look for easy money. And you don’t have to look hard for proof-of-Tate when looking for crypto scams: View post on Twitter Or what about this beauty. The future of finance/ everybody: View post on Twitter Draw your own conclusions about how ready crypto and its “community” are for mainstream adoption in between shitcoins on Bitcoin and this. The chokehold on crypto is getting stronger. After the First Crypto War and the Second Crypto War/ there may be a third crypto war on the horizon… Our Favorite Coinfession Respawning the coinfessions in light of all the memecoin madness. Something like this happened probably way too often: View post on Twitter Always remember: for every buyer/ there is a seller… Memes This round-up has been quite hard on crypto/ so time to finish on a positive note. It could always be worse: View post on Twitter Stay safe and stay away from memecoins. Till next week!

The First Diversified Proof of Stake Blockchain | CoinMarketCap","detailedContent":"The blockchain industry is constantly evolving/ with new projects and protocols emerging at a breakneck pace to help tease out the full capabilities of the technology and deliver increasingly powerful use cases. Now/ a new/ user-centric blockchain/ known simply as Tenet/ is built using the Cosmos SDK and promises to provide a modular and flexible framework for developing powerful decentralized applications (DApps). This platform introduces a new consensus mechanism called Diversified Proof of Stake (DPOS) to power potentially the most secure and accessible DeFi ecosystem yet while dismantling typical barriers to entry through a novel stablecoin solution. Subscribe Join us in showcasing the cryptocurrency revolution/ one newsletter at a time. Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox/ along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right/ millions love us!) — what are you waiting for? What Is Tenet? Tenet is bringing the most battle-tested decentralized virtual machine implementation to the Cosmos ecosystem — the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This will allow developers who are familiar with Ethereum’s tooling and SDKs to create and deploy applications on TENET Chain easily. This will provide current Ethereum and EVM-chain developers with a high-speed blockchain suitable for high-throughput and mainstream applications — including finance (DeFi)/ social apps/ data storage services and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). Since TENET Chain is built on the Cosmos SDK/ applications built on the platform immediately benefit from interoperability with the broader Cosmos ecosystem/ thanks to the InterBlockchain Communication Protocol (IBC) — this includes popular chains like Cronos/ Kava/ Osmosis/ Canto and Thorchain. Tenet introduces the concept of \"diversified PoS\"/ which sees it rely on the shared market strength of a variety of other Proof-of-Stake blockchains/ to help massively reduce its vulnerability to attacks. Learn more about the different consensus mechanisms/ here. The team behind Tenet believes that using LSDs as a native staking instrument permits a more diverse and secure system/ allowing the network to achieve extreme economic stability. The following equation demonstrates how DPOS can be used to stack the security of multiple POS chains together to exceed the security of any one component chain. StakedA is the security afforded by staked $TENET tokens/ and LSDB/ LSDC/ etc./ is the security contributed by staked LSD assets. For this reason/ Tenet allows users to stake their cross-chain LSDs to the protocol and help to secure the blockchain. These users can operate their own validator or delegate their stake to a third-party validator to share in the transaction fees accrued on the network. Users that stake their LSDs to help bolster TENET Chain’s security will receive a yield on their assets. The platform will use a vote-escrow system in combination with native gauges to ensure all stakeholders in the Tenet ecosystem are fairly rewarded or incentivized. Two of the first applications built on TENET Chain include an in-house DEX used to provide liquidity for staked LSDs as well as an open lending market where users can lend/borrow LSDs and LSDC peer-to-peer. Who Are the Founders of Tenet? The platform is being built by an established team comprised of CEO Greg Gopman — the co-founder of Akash Network and previously CMO of Ankr; COO Dan Peterson/ previously Revenue Operations Specialist at $3B staking firm Blockdaemon; and Alex Cheng/ formerly a senior product manager at Tendermint-Cosmos. Advisors include OpenAI fellow Andrew Carr and Camyar Matini/ Blockdaemon's Director of Growth Strategy. What Is the Liquid Staking Dollar (LSDC)? Tenet introduces a robust decentralized stablecoin known as the Liquid Staking Dollar/ or LSDC. The token is backed by a distributed basket of liquid staking derivatives (LSDs). These will include ETH/ BNB/ ATOM and ADA derivatives/ with the potential to support additional assets in the future. The LSDC token can be minted with overcollateralized LSD positions across several popular protocols/ platforms and asset types. This allows it to maintain its peg with zero reliance on centralized infrastructure like banks. The stablecoin is overcollateralized and is backed by an on-chain proof-of-reserve that proves its solvency and resistance to black swan events — like collapsed TerraUSD (UST). It also helps LSD users easily maximize their capital efficiency/ by unlocking an additional source of yield on their deposits and easily leveraging up using interest-free loans available via the stablecoin protocol. View post on Twitter Current State of Development Tenet is currently operating a testnet with which users can now interact by adding the Tenet network and RPC details to their Web3 wallet — there are no plans for a community airdrop. Instead/ the platform will be conducting its public sale in Q2 2023 before listing on centralized and decentralized exchanges. DAO Maker was recently revealed as Tenet’s IDO partner. The platform is currently one of the best-performing IDO launchpads by all-time high ROI and will incubate the project over its development cycle. View post on Twitter Tenet's tokenomics model was inspired by the recently elaborated veToken system and is designed to maximize participation in the network. The parameters of Tenet's vote-locking system are shown below: According to the full tokenomics/ $TENET will launch with an initial market capitalization of $625/000 (excluding liquidity) with all investors subject to a 3-month cliff before seeing their tokens unlocked linearly over 20 months. Per the official roadmap/ Tenet is slated to launch its mainnet in Q3 2023/ a suite of applications will follow shortly thereafter/ including the decentralized exchange (DEX)/ lending market (alpha product) and LSD hub. The native gauge system will go live in Q4 2023. How Does Tenet Work? The operating parameters of Tenet's Diversified Proof of Stake module will be determined by decentralized governance/ where participants can propose and vote on details like the reward weight to determine how staking rewards are split between $TENET stakers and LSD stakers. Users can also vote on which LSDs are supported by the module. According to the official documentation/ the security of TENET chain is equal to the sum total security of its own native staking asset ($TENET) and the security of any LSDs staked on the network. In time/ it could eventually become more secure than any single POS chain (depending on the total value staked). Tenet aims to make the staking process as seamless as possible/ ensuring users get the same experience whether staking TENET tokens or LSDs derived from other native gas tokens. Only $TENET stakers can participate in the governance of the network/ LSD stakers are excluded from this process. Native $TENET tokens always have a reward weight of 1/ but this number is flexible for other stakeable assets. Such that with a reward weight of 1 for $TENET and 0.5 for LSDB/ $TENET stakers will share 66.6% of staking rewards/ with the remaining 33.3% going to LSDB stakers. These rewards are derived from inflation and transaction fees/ similar to Ethereum. Rewards are paid in the form of the TENET native asset. TENET Chain also supports an optional third reward type known as the take rate/ which is an annualized tax applied to LSDs staked on the platform. This take rate is shared among stakers on the TENET blockchain/ helping to diversify yields. Much like other Proof of Stake blockchains/ users will be free to delegate their stakeable assets to a validator of their choice/ based on properties like commission fee/ uptime and more. By using LSDs to secure its blockchain/ Tenet can effectively piggyback on the security of multiple sovereign chains. Because of this/ an attacker would need to take down multiple POS chains to successfully attack Tenet. The platform is built for a non-technical user base and aims to provide a human-friendly interface to the rapidly growing world of Web3 — allowing users to access the Cosmos ecosystem without the usual hurdles. Additional Features Tenet is a multi-faceted platform designed to address the shortcomings of existing layer-1s/ dismantle typical barriers to entry/ and unlock new opportunities for participants in the Web3 landscape. Besides the primary features outlined prior/ TENET Chain and the surrounding Tenet ecosystem also benefit from the following features: Stablecoin Gas: To help make transacting on TENET Chain less complicated/ gas can be paid in either $TENET tokens or $LSDC tokens — allowing users to pay the gas cost they see in exact LSDC amounts. 0% Interest Loans: LSD holders are able to take out a 0% interest loan in the form of $LSDC from the TENET protocol smart contract/ which can be used to leverage up or trade. Feeless DeFi Primitives: TENET’s feeless DeFi primitives further contribute to a user-friendly experience/ helping to minimize the interaction with complex transaction fees for some DeFi use cases — benefiting both users and developers alike. Cross-Chain Interoperability: Users can easily transact across different chains in the Cosmos ecosystem thanks to IBC/ and move their assets between independent L1s/L2s via the TENET Bridge. This provides opportunities for powerful cross-chain applications and experiences. High Scalability: Thanks to the highly efficient and secure Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithm/ TENET chain features high scalability on par with some of the fastest L1 chains — without sacrificing security. Community DAO: $TENET token holders can participate in the Tenet DAO to help govern the platform and related protocols. Unlike most other L1s/ Tenet has no VC funding/ ensuring the DAO remains controlled by the community rather than early investors. Native gauges: veTENET holders will be able to vote on how newly emitted TENET tokens are distributed within the Tenet ecosystem. It also includes provisions for third-party bribes/ helping to maximize rewards for veTENET holders and drive up demand for the $TENET token. What Is the $TENET Token? At the heart of Tenet is the $TENET token. This is used for a wide variety of purposes in the Tenet product ecosystem/ with its most prominent utility being its use as the platform’s native gas token. Users can spend $TENET tokens to pay for transactions and smart contract operations on TENET chain. It will also be woven into the apps built on the platform/ including Eva/ where users will need to pay a small fee in $TENET to perform financial operations. Some of its additional utilities will include: Access to discounted transactions in the Eva AI wallet Access to LSDC stability pool staking opportunities Participation in network validation Participation in the Tenet DAO for community governance $TENET token holders will need to participate in a vote-locking system to participate in network governance. This sees them lock their TENET tokens to receive veTENET (vote-escrowed $TENET). These users can then help decide where value accrues in the Tenet ecosystem — e.g. how block rewards and DeFi protocol incentives are distributed. What Is the Eva Wallet? Eva is one of the first applications built on Tenet. It's a Web3 wallet that leverages DeFiGPT to power a range of AI features/ such as an up-to-date crypto market chatbot. The wallet is designed to make interaction with the blockchain landscape as simple as possible/ making crypto payments and transactions as intuitive as regular banking. It enables the self-custody of assets and allows users to interact easily with DeFi applications without needing to understand the full details of how the underlying blockchain technology works. Eva is unusual among AI chatbots in that it will support voice commands/ allowing users to directly interface with the cryptocurrency market and explore current events intuitively. The wallet will use a combination of machine learning algorithms to accurately convert voice-to-text commands/ which it will then interpret and execute. View post on Twitter It will include a range of failsafe and security measures to ensure only authorized users can interact with the wallet and sign transactions before they are executed on the chain. By default/ Eva is a keyless wallet/ further reducing barriers for new users. View post on Twitter The team behind Tenet hopes that the intuitiveness of the Eva wallet will help more people reduce their reliance on centralized blockchain middleware/ like centralized exchanges/ custodians and lending platforms. The Eva wallet was recently released to the public allowing users to begin claiming $TENET and earn tickets — which can be used to unlock access to its upcoming limited public sale.

Open Campus Open Campus is a blockchain-powered educational initiative designed to help users drive real change in the world and empower individuals with knowledge. The platform provides simple no-code tools that can be used to create gamified lessons/ courses and more. It hopes to provide a user and creator-centric education ecosystem that helps teachers monetize their educational resources and learners access high-quality educational materials on any topic of interest. At the heart of this new education ecosystem is the $EDU token/ which is used to govern the Open Campus Protocol/ as payment for creators and publishers/ and for minting educational content as NFTs. In essence/ it uses blockchain technology to democratize access to educational resources/ while providing a more equitable environment for educators and publishers. View post on Twitter Open Campus has already partnered with TinyTap/ Animoca Brands/ Highstreet/ The Sandbox/ and other prominent edutainment studios that will use the protocol to build their own content and curriculums. The project was the latest to launch on Binance Launchpad/ an IEO platform that has launched many successful projects. Historically/ several Binance Launchpad projects have gone on to achieve meteoric growth after launch/ including the likes of Axie Infinity/ The Sandbox/ Polygon and STEPN — each of which went on to define their respective niches. Learn more about Open Campus/ here. Sui One of the most anticipated layer-1s since the recent launch of Aptos/ Sui is an L1 that prioritizes true asset ownership/ performance and a simplified development and user experience. Sui is unusual among layer 1s in that it's object focused. Each programmable object on the blockchain is owned by a single address/ which can update and modify these objects by submitting transactions. It is unique in that consensus is only required when transactions involve shared objects. Transactions exclusively-owned objects can be processed without consensus using Byzantine Consistent Broadcast. The platform boasts \"infinity scalability\" using horizontal scaling/ allowing multiple bundles of transactions to be processed in parallel/ helping it achieve a throughput of ~300/000 transactions per second (TPS) with just 100 validators. Sui is designed to maximize security and protect asset ownership using an efficient delegated proof-of-stake model (DPoS). Users can lock their SUI tokens to help secure the network by delegating their tokens to their chosen validators. These users are rewarded in the form of a share of the network’s gas fee revenue. The platform is designed to cater to the next billion Web3 users by providing a fast and massively scalable base layer for decentralized applications. The platform conducted its token generation event on May 5/ 2023/ and was immediately listed on many of the most popular centralized exchanges — including Binance/ OKX/ KuCoin/ Bitfinex and Huobi. It’s backed by heavyweights including Binance Labs/ a16z/ Coinbase Ventures/ Jump Crypto and Circle/ and is now operating on its mainnet. According to the official Sui ecosystem directory/ there are now more than 200 projects building in the Sui ecosystem. This includes wallets/ synthetics/ games/ NFT marketplaces/ exchanges and more. XCAD Network XCAD Network was first launched in 2021 with the goal of enhancing creator-fan interactions through the use of Zilliqa-based blockchain technology. The platform was the first to introduce the concept of Watch2Earn/ allowing users to earn rewards in the form of creator tokens for watching and interacting with content from their favorite creators. The platform helps creators better monetize their content and form a more direct relationship with their audience using blockchain technology. Through XCAD Network/ creators can launch and distribute their own creator tokens and sell provably rare NFT moments.

View post on Twitter Sweat Economy In 2022/ move-to-earn (M2E) became one of the most popular use cases of blockchain technology/ with dozens of platforms emerging to help users earn token-based rewards for staying fit. By directly tying health milestones to token-based rewards/ the move-to-earn system helped to boost fitness motivation dramatically/ and it quickly became one of the most popular uses of blockchain technology. But Sweat Economy is currently by far the most popular move-to-earn application — with over 10 million users worldwide. The project distinguishes itself from other M2E apps by its user-friendly interface. By keeping most of the blockchain elements behind the scenes/ it is easier to get to grips with/ helping more people experience the capabilities of blockchain technology without the typical hurdles — like managing seed phrases or understanding gas fees. Sweat Economy initially launched as a Web2 platform known as Sweatcoin/ but integrated blockchain technology and tokenized rewards in 2022. This helped it become the most downloaded Health & Fitness app of 2022 — with over 65 million downloads worldwide. View post on Twitter The platform has partnered with multiple health organizations/ reward partners and charities/ and is constantly building new utility for the $SWEAT token. By driving adoption through utility/ Sweat Economy hopes to become a defining app for the Web3 space. Worldcoin Worldcoin is an ambitious upcoming project that aims to provide a worldwide financial and identity network/ helping to democratize access to crucial financial services. Long-term/ the platform wants to provide a truly government-free fiat alternative and use artificial intelligence to provide a universal basic income (UBI) to its users. Worldcoin has been in development since 2019 and was co-founded by tech industry heavyweights/ including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. It has reportedly secured ~$100 million in funding. The platform consists of three primary components: The Worldcoin token: A digital asset used for payments/ governance and participation in the Worldcoin ecosystem. World ID: A privacy-preserving digital identity system. The platform uses iris-scanning technology known as the Orb to verify the identity of individuals. The World App: A mobile wallet application used for conducting transactions and identity proofs. The $WLD crypto is designed to be simple/ intuitive and immediately understandable to fiat users — keeping typical blockchain features hidden behind the scenes. Worldcoin recently released the World App/ allowing users to easily authenticate their identity and begin participating in the ecosystem. More than 1 million users worldwide have already signed up to begin using the platform. The wallet is gas free and can only be used by verified humans. The platform is being built on the Ethereum layer-2 scaling platform known as Optimism. View post on Twitter Fuel Network Billed as the \"world's fastest modular execution layer\"/ Fuel Network is designed to provide a powerful execution environment for modular blockchains — such as Celestia. The platform allows blockchains to benefit from massive transactional scalability/ thanks to its parallel execution capabilities. It provides a resource-efficient virtual machine implementation/ known as FuelVM. This is designed to be incredibly fast/ allowing smart contract operations and state changes to be performed quickly. It does this while keeping fees low/ helping to tackle the fee inflation currently seen by popular existing L1s — like Ethereum and BNB Chain. View post on Twitter Fuel applications can be built using the domain-specific programming language known as Sway. This is based on Rust and is highly simplified/ allowing developers to get to grips with the language with minimal barriers to entry. By providing a friendly developer experience and a generous grant program/ Fuel Network hopes to help bootstrap its DApp ecosystem — which already includes a variety of promising and useful projects. This includes the NFT marketplace ‘Thunder’ and DEX ‘SwaySwap’. Fuel Labs has been developing Fuel Network since 2018 and the platform is now in its testnet stage of development with its mainnet expected to launch later this year. Learn more about Fuel Network in our full deep dive. Celestia On the topic of modular blockchain infrastructure/ Celestia has been garnering a great deal of attention in recent months as a minimalist blockchain that separates data availability/ consensus and execution. The platform is designed to dramatically increase the scalability and flexibility of blockchains/ allowing anybody to deploy their own blockchain with minimal overhead. By providing on-demand consensus and security/ Celestia minimizes the costs associated with bootstrapping a blockchain and maintaining its security. Celestia is not involved in transaction validation and only ensures transaction data is made available through a novel process known as data available sampling (DAS). This innovation allows Celestia to avoid the throughput bottleneck faced by legacy blockchains while reducing the burden on nodes — helping with decentralization. The platform also leverages a technology known as Namespaced Merkle Trees (NMTs) which helps make data queries for specific applications far more simple and efficient. Celestia is widely considered to be a potentially foundational piece of blockchain infrastructure that could potentially boost the performance of dozens of layer 1s by acting as an efficient data availability layer. It currently has a growing ecosystem of applications and services/ many of which either leverage Celestia's modular architecture or act as accessory modules — such as execution environments or settlement layers.

Iris-Scanning Crypto Project Founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman | CoinMarketCap","detailedContent":"Introduction Despite the advancements in technology/ there is/ inevitably/ a subset of society that is still catching up. An estimated 1 billion individuals worldwide/ many in developing countries/ lack a legal identity or digitally verifiable one. Globally/ over 1.7 billion adults do not have access to a bank/ many in rural areas. Alongside the ever-looming presence of AI/ seen in the rise of AI technologies like ChatGPT by OpenAI/ and the proliferation of the internet/ this brings about the question: how can everyone have universal access to the global economy/ while distinguishing between bots and humans in the digital space? These two overarching themes come together to form the foundation of Worldcoin/ an open source system designed to provide proof of personhood and financial public goods simultaneously/ as AI technology becomes more prevalent. Subscribe Join us in showcasing the cryptocurrency revolution/ one newsletter at a time. Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox/ along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right/ millions love us!) — what are you waiting for? What Is Worldcoin? Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic/ Worldcoin (WLD) was co-founded by none other than the CEO of OpenAI/ Sam Altman/ alongside Max Novendstern and Alex Blania. The founders believe that \"Worldcoin could drastically increase economic opportunity/ scale a reliable solution for distinguishing humans from AI online while preserving privacy/ enable global democratic processes/ and eventually show a potential path to AI-funded UBI.\" Worldcoin aims to be the “world’s largest identity and financial public utility”/ by leveraging blockchain technology to target the two above-mentioned issues to democratize access to the global economy/ especially for the less fortunate/ and as well as use it as a step towards universal basic income (UBI) to support the people whose jobs have been displaced by AI. Worldcoin is structured into three main segments/ namely: 1. World ID 2. World App 3. Worldcoin Token These three segments come together to form a comprehensive solution that is Worldcoin. What Is the World ID? World ID claims to be a decentralized/ privacy-protected identity solution/ intended to bring “global proof of personhood to the internet.” This essentially allows each user to prove that they are/ indeed/ a unique individual/ instead of bots that would misuse Worldcoin’s services and benefits granted to users. World ID is designed with the citizens of developing nations in mind/ many of whom do not have any properly verifiable forms of identification. Worldcoin stated that the World ID can be thought of as a “digital passport that lets you prove you are a unique and real person while remaining anonymous.” This data stored is protected by zero-knowledge technology/ which enables it to be used to verify a user’s personhood/ but without revealing their actual identity or their online habits to counterparties. The World ID is not tied to the actual biometric data/ but is simply a form of proof that the user is verified and can be trusted to be an actual human user. This is similar to most forms of identification that include certain watermarked/ embossed or holographic markings to certify the legitimacy of the document. The use cases of the World ID include allowing users to \"sign in with Worldcoin\" on a website/ mobile app or cryptocurrency DApp. What Is the World App? The first step to getting verified with World ID is getting Worldcoin’s mobile app/ known as World App/ with more options coming. World App functions very much like a stripped down crypto wallet/ plus a few additional features. It is tied to the user’s World ID and allows it to be used with Worldcoin’s related services/ such as Worldcoin grants. Worldcoin grants are payouts for users in eligible countries/ who are verified via World ID. They can be seen as a form of fair and equal distribution to all World ID verified users/ simply by nature of being able to prove that they are real humans. These grants are time-limited offers and are paid out in Worldcoin’s token/ WLD/ which is currently not trading yet. Additionally/ World App supports wallet features/ including sending and receiving tokens as well as the buying and selling of tokens. That said/ trading of tokens are currently limited to BTC (wrapped)/ ETH and DAI. Worldcoin explained that this allows users who are new to the crypto space to not be intimidated by the number of available tokens and can learn in a controlled environment. Users can also on-ramp and offramp funds easily via Moonpay and Ramp/ which have been integrated with the app. World App is currently in beta and runs on the Polygon blockchain. However/ Worldcoin recently announced that they are in the works to migrate World App to Optimism/ as part of Optimism’s Superchain. This is part of the collaboration between Optimism and Worldcoin and the migration is expected to come concurrently with the next Ethereum upgrade/ EIP-4844/ which will introduce a significant transaction fee reduction on Ethereum Layer-2s. Additionally/ the app integrates account abstraction via Safe’s tried and tested contracts/ allowing the user experience to be optimized for new crypto users. Beyond basic wallet functions/ World App also boasts Learn-to-Earn courses to provide new users with the materials to learn more about crypto and earn BTC/ ETH and DAI. While non-verified users can still access the materials/ the rewards for completion are only available to users who are World ID-verified. Other World ID benefits on the World App include gas-free transactions when using the wallet. Although the World App has only just been opened to the public/ more than 1.5 million users have already signed up/ of which 500K are active users. The app sees an average of 60K transactions daily and 25K World ID checks. With the app now open globally/ these numbers are only expected to rise. Source: Worldcoin (link) What Is the Worldcoin Token (WLD)? The Worldcoin token/ or simply Worldcoin (WLD)/ is the final piece of the puzzle. Within the World App/ Worldcoin is the currency in which grants are currently issued. View post on Twitter The Worldcoin token (WLD) went live on July 24/ 2023 and listed on exchanges like Binance/ Bybit/ Huobi/ Gate.io and more. The \"digital currency (WLD) received simply for being human\" allows users that have biometrically verified their identity at a worldcoin orb and download the World wallet app to receive WLD tokens. The WLD token has a maximum supply of 10 billion/ and the official ERC-20 contract address is 0x163f8c2467924be0ae7b5347228cabf260318753. Beyond grants/ Worldcoin will also be used for governance over the Worldcoin protocol to determine the direction and future of Worldcoin. Additionally/ the token can be expected to be integrated with the World App to be used as payments for specific services. Currently/ Worldcoin is not intended to be distributed to citizens in the United States or any of the other restricted regions. Users can learn more in the whitepaper. How To Get Verified on Worldcoin? While there are several layers to identity verification/ a user can get World ID verified only through Worldcoin Operators/ using a device known as the Orb. The Orb is a biometric imaging device/ which captures the user’s iris. Since an iris pattern is extremely hard to fake/ this is used as Worldcoin’s chosen method of identity verification to prove that a single person has not signed up for multiple World IDs. Since these verifications are done in-person with the World App/ this means that no other information such as their emails or names are required/ which makes World ID a pseudonymous form of identification. To get verified/ users can: 1. Download the World App on the App Store or the Google Play Store 2. After passing the initial setup/ users can find an Orb near them by following the instructions in the app. 3. Complete verification with a Worldcoin Operator at the chosen location. Once done/ the World ID will be available in the app/ enabling the user to access various services and benefits. Currently/ the Orbs are available for limited periods in the following cities from May to July 2023: Berlin Dubai London Mexico City Miami New York City San Francisco Seoul Tokyo Hong Kong Singapore Other locations and dates on their World Tour will be announced via their social media channels such as Discord and Twitter. Interested users can check out the Orb locations in their official website. Beyond Worldcoin’s use case of World ID for increasing accessibility to the global economy and financial services/ World ID can also be easily used in other applications/ such as social media sites looking to cut down on bot profiles. In fact/ World ID has been released with its SDK/ allowing builders to leverage their technology in their own applications. Concerns Over Worldcoin The Orb method of verification has riled up many privacy advocates/ with many criticizing the process as “dystopian-like.” In fact/ this stirred up a 2022 MIT Technology Review exposé which highlighted privacy concerns in Worldcoin’s practice and how the less fortunate were being exploited. Tools for Humanity/ one of the partners building Worldcoin/ had to step in to refute the allegations. Others/ like former Ethereum developer Hudson Jameson/ believes that Worldcoin shows a lack of transparency and regards its tokenomics as \"questionable.\" View post on Twitter Nevertheless/ Worldcoin is reportedly close to a $100 million raise/ a significant amount in the current market conditions. Worldcoin has already raised funds from prominent investors such as a16z/ Digital Currency Group and Coinbase Ventures in its Series A round.

After gaining entry/ hackers can steal data or digital assets/ or inflict harm on the system. Crypto scams revolves around deceiving people into giving away sensitive data/ private keys to their wallets or their crypto assets directly. This could come from counterfeit or phishing emails to rug pulls. Attacks have a wider scope/ including any action targeting a digital system or network with the intent to cause disruption or damage. Crypto exploits refer specifically to exploiting vulnerabilities/ typically in crypto software to gain access and drain assets. As the use of cryptocurrencies gains widespread adoption/ so too does the prevalence of associated risks. Hacks/ scams/ attacks and exploits have all become common occurrences in the crypto ecosystem/ resulting in significant financial losses for both crypto users and even institutions. In this article/ we will delve into the distinctions between these four terms/ and explore strategies for safeguarding oneself against them.

Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox/ along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right/ millions love us!) — what are you waiting for? Crypto Hacks Crypto hacks have become an unfortunate and frequent event — just take a look at the worst hacks last year. Hacks involve unauthorized access and theft of digital assets or information from cryptocurrency exchanges or wallets. These incidents can occur due to various reasons/ such as vulnerabilities in security systems/ social engineering techniques/ or even insider theft. The aftermath of such hacks can be disastrous for both the exchange or wallet and its users. Retrieving stolen digital assets can be challenging/ or even impossible/ while the reputation of the exchange or wallet can be irreparably damaged. A prime example is the infamous Mt. Gox hack in 2014/ where 850/000 bitcoins worth over $450 million were stolen/ resulting in Mt. Gox's bankruptcy and a diminished trust in cryptocurrency security. Digital currency exchanges and wallets must employ robust security protocols/ including two-factor authentication and cold storage/ to shield against hackers. Periodic security evaluations can further help in identifying vulnerabilities. It's also important to remember: “not your keys/ not your crypto.” Cryptocurrency users bear significant responsibility in averting hacks by securing their private keys/ utilizing distinct passwords/ and refrain from holding all of their digital assets on a single exchange or wallet. Regulatory bodies can also assume a pivotal role in preventing hacks in the crypto space. By establishing and enforcing security regulations and standards/ they can guarantee that exchanges and wallets adhere to a certain degree of accountability/ safeguarding users in the process. Recent Crypto Hacks Level Finance recently experienced a $1 million exploit due to a buggy smart contract. The decentralized finance (DeFi) platform's vulnerability was exploited by a hacker who took advantage of the faulty smart contract to drain funds from the platform. Level Finance confirmed the incident and assured users that it would investigate the issue further to identify the cause and ensure it does not happen again. In another case/ Hundred Finance lost $7 million in an Optimism hack. According to Certik/ the hacker “manipulated the exchange rate between ERC-20 tokens and hTOKENS/” allowing them to withdraw more tokens than deposited. Hundred Finance acknowledged the breach and assured users that it would work closely with the Optimism team to address the security flaws and recover the stolen funds. These two incidents emphasize the growing risks associated with the rapidly evolving DeFi ecosystem and the need for rigorous security measures to protect users and their digital assets. Crypto Scams In the world of digital currencies and anonymous personas/ scams are becoming a widespread problem — causing people to lose their crypto assets or personal information. These scams usually happen through phishing emails or websites/ schemes that promise big returns but don't deliver/ fake crypto projects or rug pulls/ and fake trading platforms. Also read: What Is a Rug Pull in Crypto? Phishing scams trick people into giving their login information or private keys to fake websites or emails that look real. Ponzi schemes are crypto projects that offer high returns/ but depend on new people joining to pay older members. Fake projects create a token and rug pull — dumping the token on people who bought and disappearing with the money. Finally/ fake trading platforms attract users with good deals but then take their crypto assets and disappear. To avoid being scammed/ it's important to be careful and watch out. Only use trusted trading places and digital wallets that have a good history of safety/ research before investing/ and be careful of any unexpected offers or messages asking for personal information or online money. Keep your private keys safe and don't share them with anyone. Recent Crypto Scam With the increasing excitement around memecoins like PEPE/ malicious individuals have begun to exploit the situation/ leading to an influx of scams in the crypto space. Blockchain security company PeckShield reported that in May/ there have been a minimum of 10 memecoin scams initiated. The firm identified and notified recent scam tokens that removed liquidity/ causing unsuspecting investors to fall prey to rug-pulling schemes. Crypto Attacks As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to expand/ the threat of cyberattacks like Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks/ malware attacks and ransomware attacks is increasingly prevalent. A DoS attack overwhelms a network or system by flooding it with excessive traffic/ causing it to become inoperable. In the context of cryptocurrencies/ these attacks can target exchanges or platforms/ effectively denying users access to their digital assets or the ability to carry out transactions. Malware attacks/ on the other hand/ entail the installation of malicious software on a system or network/ granting an unauthorized party access to sensitive information or digital assets. Within crypto/ these attacks can result in private keys or login credentials being stolen/ providing an intruder with access to digital assets worth millions of dollars. Ransomware attacks involve the encryption of a system or network's files/ with the decryption key only being provided upon the payment of a ransom. These attacks can target exchanges or wallets/ effectively preventing users from accessing their digital assets until the ransom is satisfied. To protect against these attacks/ cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets must adopt strong security measures/ conduct routine security audits/ and utilize cold storage solutions to mitigate cyber threats. Recent Crypto Attacks A major cyberattack has struck one of the biggest cryptocurrency mining pools in the world/ which offers mining options for a range of digital assets/ including Bitcoin and Litecoin/ causing a significant loss of both company and customer funds. The incident took place on Dec. 3/ 2022/ with the attackers managing to steal roughly $700/000 in client assets and $2.3 million in assets belonging to the company. Crypto Exploits An exploit in the cryptocurrency world is a technique that takes advantage of a flaw or vulnerability within a system to gain unauthorized access/ execute malicious code/ or cause other undesirable effects. Such exploits often lead to the theft of coins or tokens/ resulting in financial losses for the victims. These exploits can occur in various ways/ including software bugs/ network attacks/ or even human errors/ and are becoming increasingly common in the crypto realm. Some common types of cryptocurrency exploits include flash loan attacks/ 51% attacks/ and wash trading. Flash loan attacks involve malicious actors taking out cryptocurrency loans to manipulate the market/ while 51% attacks occur when a single entity or group gains control of over 50% of a Proof-of-Work network's mining power/ enabling them to double-spend coins and disrupt transaction confirmations. Wash trading/ on the other hand/ involves the artificial inflation of a token's price through rapid buying and selling by a trader/ with the aim of making a profit when the price is pumped up. The consequences of these exploits can range from minor losses to significant financial damage. In March of 2023/ the crypto industry saw a total of 23 major attacks/ marking the second-lowest number of attacks since February 2022/ which had 21. The average loss per attack in March was $10/149/676/ a substantial increase from February's average of $1/742/748 per attack. Recent Crypto Exploits The most significant exploit in March was the Euler Finance incident/ resulting in a loss of around $200 million. Occurring on March 13/ 2023/ it has been the largest attack this year. The attacker/ known as Jacob/ leveraged assets borrowed from a flash loan and exploited vulnerabilities within Euler's pool contracts to drain five Euler Finance Pools. Since then/ Jacob has gradually returned $177 million of the stolen funds. The second-largest exploit happened on Feb 3/ when Polygon-based lending and stablecoin protocol/ BonqDAO and AllianceBlock/ was hit by a two-stage attack on Wednesday in a price oracle manipulation. The exploit was reported to be $120 million/ although the exploiter only managed to siphon off $1.3 million worth due to low liquidity. Differences Between Hack/ Scam/ Attack and Exploit Understanding the nuances between hacking/ scamming/ attacking and exploiting is essential. These terms refer to distinct types of threats that can compromise one’s digital assets. Hacking involves breaking into a system or network/ often through exploiting vulnerabilities in software or hardware. This may involve techniques like brute force attacks or phishing scams. Once access is gained/ hackers can steal data or digital assets/ or cause damage to the system. Scamming/ on the other hand/ is focused on tricking individuals into giving away sensitive information or crypto. This can take many forms/ from fake emails posing as legitimate crypto platforms to fraudulent investment schemes. Attacks are broader in scope/ encompassing any action that aims to disrupt/ damage/ or destroy a digital system or network. Exploits/ meanwhile/ refer specifically to taking advantage of vulnerabilities in software or hardware to gain unauthorized access or control over a system or network. It's important to note that while hacking and exploiting are similar and often require technical skills and knowledge/ scamming and attacking can be carried out through social engineering tactics like phishing.

,{"link":"https://coinmarketcap.com/academy/article/centralization-risk-in-crypto","websiteSource":"CoinMarketCap","type":"article","summary":"Explore the complexities of centralization in the crypto industry and its risks in assets like Ethereum, Bitcoin, popular layer-ones and DeFi.","title":"Centralization Risk in Crypto: How Decentralized Is Crypto? | CoinMarketCap","detailedContent":"TL;DR: Centralization in crypto occurs when there are choke points within the technology stack/ leading to potential censorship and risks. Examples include a limited number of internet service providers/ concentrated mining operations/ and centralized node hosting. Censorship can be strong/ where transactions are excluded from a block/ or weak/ occurring on the infrastructure level. Centralization risks come in various forms/ such as governance/ consensus/ motivational/ topological/ and network/ all of which can have a ripple effect across the industry. The crypto industry has a love-hate relationship with centralization. We need centralization/ but we don't like it. Everything should be as decentralized as possible/ but we also love fast transactions and low fees. Centralization risk is real. 2022 highlighted the risk of centralization of capital with the collapse of 3AC and FTX. But there are other centralization risks out there/ and you don't have to dig deep to find them even in the most popular cryptocurrencies. Subscribe Join us in showcasing the cryptocurrency revolution/ one newsletter at a time. Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox/ along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right/ millions love us!) — what are you waiting for? What Is Centralization In Crypto? Centralization in crypto comes from centralized points in the tech stack. Any time there is a choke point in the infrastructure/ centralization occurs. To name only a few examples: There are only a handful of internet service providers to use. Miners are concentrated due to economies of scale in hash power/ meaning it's easier for bigger mining farms to be profitable. Nodes can have centralized clients or rely on centralized node hosting. Centralization can also lead to censorship. Here/ censorship refers to the exclusion of transactions or addresses. We can distinguish between strong censorship and weak censorship. Strong censorship is the exclusion of transactions from a block. It happens on the protocol level when miners don't process a transaction from a certain address. One example would be the Tornado Cash sanctions. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Tornado Cash and several associated Ethereum addresses in August 2022/ leading to relay operators to filter specific transactions. Weak censorship can happen at the protocol or the infrastructure level. An example is DeFi frontends or infrastructure providers like Infura restricting the flow of transactions through their nodes. Of course/ this happened with Infura a few months ago/ sparking a discussion about the decentralization of Ethereum. The conclusion is that more centralization opens the way to more potential censorship. But centralization can come in many shapes and sizes. Different Types Of Centralization Risks A study about blockchain decentralization by blockchain security company Trail of Bits points out different vectors of centralization risks. Governance: how many entities are needed to disrupt the system? Consensus: how many entities control the hashing or validation power? Motivational: how are participants incentivized to act correctly? Topological: can a few nodes be disrupted/ impacting the entire network? Network: are nodes dispersed geographically and across internet service providers (ISP)? Software: does the blockchain depend on any special software? Some of these have been well-known topics of discussion for Bitcoin/ Ethereum and other chains. For example/ while consensus and governance centralization are similar/ you can argue that Ethereum is exposed to an added risk vector through Vitalik. If someone \"disrupted\" Vitalik/ it would throw Ethereum into turmoil/ regardless of how many entities control validation power. In a way/ this happened to Solana when FTX/ one of its biggest backers/ went under. In similar fashion/ topological centralization can harm scaling solutions and alternative L1 chains. They depend on cross-chain bridges/ which can be exploited and proverbially sever the link to the more liquid ecosystems. Examples of this abound: The $190M hack of Nomad. The hack of Binance's bridge. The $625M hack of Ronin bridge. With that in mind/ what kind of centralization risks do the big ecosystems face? Centralization Risk In Ethereum Ethereum has a fair bit of centralization risk. Take consensus centrality. At the time of writing/ Lido and the top three CEXes Binance/ Coinbase and Kraken hold a majority of the staked ETH. Source: dune.com While Lido technically only \"aggregates\" the delegated staking power it is assigned/ the concentration of voting power in the hands of a few entities can lead to cartelization. MEV can even amplify this going forward. Speaking of MEV/ this has become another point of discussion for Ethereum. In simple terms/ MEV refers to the profit miners can make by prioritizing some transactions over others. This process of front-running has led to the rise of MEV boost relay companies. These are companies providing tools that help everyone to capture a slice of extra profit from MEV. The problem? Validators that use these tools outsource the decision over what transactions go into a block to the MEV boost relayers. And if these companies want to be compliant with/ say/ a sanctions regime that can exclude certain blocks/ that would be censorship. Censorship/ which comes from centralization. Below is the share of \"sanctions-compliant blocks\" in Ethereum: Source: mevwatch.info The share is currently declining/ but the centralization risk is there. Then there are centralized choke points: validator clients and node hosting diversity. Most of Ethereum's nodes depend on one execution client (Geth). AWS hosts the majority of nodes. Two companies provide a majority of nodes with consensus clients. Source: Messari While these are not imminent or even critical risk vectors/ they go to show that even a nominally decentralized chain like Ethereum is not that decentralized. You can have many nodes/ which are widely distributed geographically/ and still have centralization bottlenecks. And Gary Gensler doesn't even consider Ethereum validators to be that decentralized/ which is why the SEC argues that ETH is a security. Ethereum addressed this with an addition to its roadmap called “the Scourge.” So the community is aware of these potentially problematic issues and is looking to resolve them. Centralization Risk In Bitcoin Bitcoin's community prides itself on Bitcoin being the most decentralized blockchain. But there are also centralization risks in Bitcoin. The obvious one is the concentration of hash power in the proverbial hands of a few mining entities. AntPool (30.63%) and Foundry USA (19.77%) control a majority of the hash rate at the time of writing. Add a third pool in F2Pool (14.26%)/ and you have a comfortable majority. A fourth in Binance Pool (11.5%)/ and 75% of the hash rate is owned by four mining pools. Source: blockchain.com This is not necessarily bad or an immediate risk. Bitcoin's security model aligns miners' interests with that of the network as a whole. However/ not being a risk today does not mean it cannot become a risk ever. The Nakamoto Coefficient measures how many entities are necessary to disrupt a blockchain system. For Bitcoin/ it's currently only at two since only two mining pools would need to be disrupted. Moreover/ the Trail of Bits study found that 60% of Bitcoin traffic traverses only three ISPs. Bitcoin ASICs production is highly centralized/ with a few players like Bitmain and MicroBT dominating the market. Since Bitcoin’s value is a function of the kinetic energy it converts via ASICs/ centralization is naturally going to occur. The geographic distribution of BTC mining power follows a similar pattern: 58% of the mining power in January 2022 were located in the US (37%) or China (21%)/ according to the Cambridge Institute for Alternative Finance. For a currency whose community would like to see it become the next world reserve currency/ Bitcoin is not all that much more decentralized than fiat currencies. Centralization Risk in Other Layer-One Chains Other blockchains like BNB Chain and Solana have often faced the wrath of hardcore crypto supporters/ who accuse them of being too centralized. For instance/ some pointed out that BNB Chain only has 21 validators. However/ BNB Chain developers have also stressed that decentralization is a process and not an end state BNB Chain claims to already have reached: View post on Twitter Solana has had to battle with repeated outages over the last years due to its hardware-hungry blockchain. This has led to Crypto Twitter quipping that Solana has “opening hours” and a support desk that will address issues when needed. And while it is true that Solana is heavily influenced and controlled by the Solana foundation/ in other regards it is also more decentralized than chains like Ethereum or Bitcoin. For example/ Solana’s Nakamoto Coefficient of 27 is much higher than that of its bigger rivals. Solana also requires no minimum stake to be a validator. Though Ethereum works around this requirement with liquid staking derivatives/ it introduces the very centralization many fear. Node hosting providers are similarly (de)centralized as with Ethereum: Source: coinmonks.com On the other hand/ hardware requirement is famously expensive/ which has contributed to the very outages that keep plaguing the blockchain. Centralization Risk in DeFi This guide wouldn't be complete without a section on centralization risks in DeFi. They are a major concern and point of discussion for crypto natives. One of the primary risks associated with DeFi is the potential for a single entity to gain control over a large portion of the network. Be it through majority control of the governance power or being able to unilaterally change the smart contracts power a protocol. DeFi is far less equipped to deal with these risks than crypto folks like to admit. The Wormhole hack in February 2022 is a prime example of this. A hacker was able to steal 120/000 wrapped Ether (wETH) from Wormhole/ a cross-chain bridge. The hacker was able to do this because the project had a vulnerability that allowed them to gain control of the funds. But the story doesn't end there. The Wormhole hacker attempted to escape with the funds by moving them through various protocols. However/ in February this year/ Jump Crypto/ the fund that initially plugged the liquidity hole caused by the hack/ was able to recover the funds. But that required a bit of centralized help. Jump Crypto was able to obtain a court order from the High Court of England and Wales/ which directed Oasis Protocol to take all necessary steps to retrieve the assets. And by necessary steps/ we mean changing the multisig to retroactively strip the hacker of their funds. Was this an example of how centralization can be (ab)used in DeFi? Only through the intervention of a centralized entity was the hacker stopped. Not very decentralized/ is it? View post on Twitter Conclusion Centralization risks in blockchains are real. Hosting providers and internet service providers are common bottlenecks for almost all blockchains. The concentration of capital and/or hardware inevitably leads to centralization. But it’s also important to keep in mind that centralization in itself isn’t bad. As long as stakeholders in blockchain ecosystems work towards developing and improving the chain/ centralization can even lead to efficiency gains. Crypto supporters just need to be mindful of how to mitigate the side effects of centralization.

The term has since been co-opted by the crypto community/ where it is now used to describe an attempt to drain a competitor’s critical resources or outcompete it by virtue of its advantages. Vampire attacks can simply be described as a type of aggressive marketing or growth strategy/ rather than outright theft or nefarious activities/ despite the negative connotations associated with the word “attack.” Also read: Hack vs Scam vs Attack vs Exploit Subscribe Join us in showcasing the cryptocurrency revolution/ one newsletter at a time. Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox/ along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right/ millions love us!) — what are you waiting for? What Are Vampire Attacks? In the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs)/ a vampire attack occurs when a new project or protocol — typically a fork of an existing blockchain project — offers better incentives or rewards to users than the original project. Generally/ successful vampire attacks result in a significant loss of liquidity and network effects for affected projects. In some cases/ the new project may even completely \"suck the life\" out of the original project/ hence the term \"vampire attack”/ in these cases/ the project can be essentially completely abandoned in favor of the new one. Vampire attacks can be either very common or extremely rare/ depending on how strict your definition is. But today/ it is safe to say that most popular DeFi and NFT protocols have either experienced or initiated some form of a vampire attack. For instance/ the upstart NFT marketplace Blur against OpenSea: Comparison to Other Attack Types Vampire attacks differ greatly from the regular black or grey hat attack types common to the DeFi and broader crypto industries. While they are considered an ‘attack’/ they’re generally legal and are simply a form of competition. Besides the regular hacks/ brute forcing and phishing attacks/ there are a number of more nuanced attacks that currently affect the crypto space. Here are some of the most prominent: Sybil attacks: Sybil attacks involve creating multiple fake identities to manipulate a system. In DeFi/ this type of attack can take the form of a fake liquidity provider/ or be used to accumulate control over a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Front-running attacks: Front-running attacks involve exploiting the time delay between when a transaction is sent and when it is processed. In DeFi/ this type of attack can take the form of a miner extracting value (MEV) from a transaction before it is confirmed/ such as by sniping potentially profitable transactions or siphoning profit from traders using sandwich tactics. Learn more about front running and miner extractable value. Insider attacks: Insider attacks involve an individual within the system abusing their access privileges. In DeFi/ this type of attack can take the form of a developer adding a backdoor to a smart contract/ or an employee buying up/selling spot market tokens before an important announcement or product update. 51% attacks: This occurs when an attacker or group of attackers are able to temporarily gain a more than 51% share of a network’s hash rate or validator set and can double-spend funds. This most commonly occurs after a blockchain re-org or fork. The main difference between vampire and other attack types is that the former involves using whitehat strategies to drain liquidity/ users/ trading volume/ or some other key resource from competing platforms/ whereas most other attacks involve hacking/ manipulation/ and/or exploitation. Usual Targets of Vampire Attacks Vampire attacks are a relatively common affair in the DApps space/ but some projects are far more likely to fall victim to one if they are prime targets. Generally/ any project that relies heavily on user adoption and liquidity is vulnerable to vampire attacks. This includes decentralized exchanges (DEXs)/ NFT marketplaces/ yield farms and any other project that features liquidity pools. View post on Twitter Some of the features that make a project particularly susceptible to an attack include: High liquidity: Projects with high liquidity are attractive targets for vampire attacks/ as they offer a large pool of capital for the attacker to capture. Established user base: Projects with an established user base are also vulnerable/ as they have a community that the attacker can tap into. High fees: Projects that charge high fees to users are particularly vulnerable/ as the attacker can offer lower fees to attract users away from the original project. Lack of innovation: Projects that lack innovation and fail to offer new features or better incentives to users prime targets for vampire attacks/ as they are more likely to be eclipsed by a fast-moving competing project. Steps To Carry Out a Vampire Attack Now that we’ve understood what kind of projects are vulnerable/ let’s look at the usual methods and steps a project typically takes before carrying out a vampire attack. Identify the target platform. Offer higher incentives to attract users from the target platform/ such as airdrops. Employ several marketing methods to inform the target community about the new platform and its advantages. Introduce new liquidity pools on the new platform to gradually expand its offering. Use the new platform's tokens as rewards to incentivize users to move their liquidity. Increase liquidity and trading volume on the new platform. While this strategy can be effective in attracting users and increasing liquidity/ it's often viewed as unethical and could be detrimental to the overall health of the ecosystem. On the other hand/ increased competition could seed out legacy projects that do not innovate and ultimately reward the end users. Preventing Vampire Attacks Now that you know about how these attacks are typically carried out/ let’s dive into the methods and practices projects use to reduce their vulnerability to these attacks/ or recover after being attacked. Lock-in period Commitment to a lock-in period can be required for new liquidity providers. This prevents them from providing liquidity only to withdraw it immediately after receiving their rewards/ leaving the protocol with reduced liquidity. This is an example of mercenary behavior and is common to new DEXes. Token withdrawal restrictions Restricting the number of LP tokens that each user can withdraw over a period of time can prevent the mass migration of users and liquidity. This ensures that the protocol retains a sufficient amount of liquidity to function properly since illiquid DEXes typically suffer from high slippage. Voting mechanism A voting mechanism or full DAO structure can allow users to have a say in the direction of the protocol. This can help prevent vampire attacks by allowing users to choose protocols that are more aligned with their interests while maximizing the room for further growth. Dynamic rewards Dynamic rewards can help to maximize participant loyalty by providing an incentive to contribute liquidity or remain active for longer. By providing increased rewards for commitment and loyalty/ platforms can help to reduce user churn/ attract loyal users and retain existing users. Token vesting By vesting rewards to liquidity providers/ platforms can ensure they maintain their liquidity for longer. Some platforms also go one step further by forfeiting rewards if users withdraw their liquidity before a certain minimum commitment period. Security audits By maximizing security/ platforms can boost user confidence/ giving them an edge over competing platforms that aren’t necessarily battle-tested or proven robust. These solutions can mitigate most/ if not all/ of the risks associated with vampire attacks and promote healthy competition between protocols in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Prominent Examples of Crypto Vampire Attacks The clearest examples of vampire attacks arise through forks/ whereby an existing blockchain or protocol is copied/ modified and launched as a direct competitor to the original. By offering better incentives for users/ nodes/ developers/ investors/ partners/ and more/ the fork aims to suck the life out of its predecessor/ and go on to become the default platform going forward. Some of the more prominent examples of vampire attacks/ albeit not all were successful/ include: 1. SushiSwap/UniSwap: At launch/ the decentralized exchange (DEX) SushiSwap used enhanced incentives to entice liquidity providers away from the leading AMM DEX/ Uniswap. It later differentiated its feature set and capabilities to grow its user base. However/ Uniswap currently retains its position as the market leader. 2. Blur/OpenSea: NFT marketplace Blur incentivized the migration of traders from competing platforms through the use of airdrop incentives. The platform temporarily overtook OpenSea by trading volume and other metrics/ such as royalty fees. 3. Dash/Masternode projects: Dash fell victim to wave after wave of vampire attacks after it popularized the masternode concept to unlock additional blockchain utility. Later masternode projects including PivX/ SmartCash/ ZCoin/ Dash Diamond/ and more either forked and modified Dash or replicated its functionality to directly compete with it. Overall/ vampire attacks could be seen as a positive for the web3 ecosystem since they give rise to stiffer competition among projects — regardless of how established they are — and force innovation and improvement. While many projects that employ vampire attack tactics offer nothing unique or distinguishing/ many have proven to be intrinsically superior to competitors/ and have gone on to prove their legitimacy and value. Those that are low effort cash-grabs tend to cannibalize one another/ before falling into obscurity.

Let’s see how crypto bros reacted to that and much more… Whose Threads Are a Must-Read? Thread section is coming up a bit shorter this week. However/ if you are looking for “muh macro outlook/” look no further than the LeBron James of macro investing: Stanley Druckenmiller. This is/ strictly speaking/ not a crypto thread but still highly relevant. Druckenmiller gave a presentation about whether US exceptionalism is at risk: View post on Twitter It’s a dense topic (especially for you crypto bros printing money out of thin air)/ so here’s the TLDR: The US fiscal position is on an unsustainable path/ with debt levels only comparable to those after WWII. The fiscal gap is equivalent to a 40% increase in all Federal taxes collected/ or a cut of 35% in federal spending. Druckenmiller is bullish on generative AI/ and is currently short USD/ long Gold/ Euro/ Oil and AUD. So if crypto can demonstrate a use case for the AI revolution or become a commodity/ could it moon as well? Who knows. Regardless/ this is well worth a read since Druckenmiller is one of the all-time great investors. Something crypto bros will definitely be able to relate to is a ‘why this token is gud’ thread. Coming to your rescue is Crypto McKenna with a thread about Arbitrum and its promising ecosystem: View post on Twitter And the obligatory TLDR: Arbitrum is actively capturing Ethereum protocols/ users and liquidity. The 7-day rolling transaction count on $ARB has increased from 222.7k to 1.45m since the start of 2023. EIP-4844 is a proposed improvement that could reduce gas fees on roll-ups by 10-30x.

Talk of the Town Crypto bros were in shock and disbelief over the attitude displayed by Congressman Sherman: View post on Twitter Safe to say the fight between crypto bros and the US government is still in its early rounds. One of the judges/ namely the US Chamber of Commerce/ may have scored a round in favor of crypto bros last week in its statement: View post on Twitter That must have felt good for Coinbase/ which had a tough last week after a serious blunder when it labeled PEPE a “hate symbol” in a newsletter.

Subscribe Join us in showcasing the cryptocurrency revolution/ one newsletter at a time. Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox/ along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right/ millions love us!) — what are you waiting for? Difference Between Token Migration and Token Swap The cryptocurrency industry has come a long way since Bitcoin’s debut in 2009. Starting with the ICO boom of 2017 to decentralized finance (DeFi)/ non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs)/ the nascent sector has welcomed a number of innovations. Amid the growing adoption of cryptocurrencies/ one service that has undoubtedly played a crucial role in building the ecosystem is token swap. Although different from token migration/ it is not uncommon for crypto participants to use both terms interchangeably. However/ a token swap is technically different from a token migration. In this article/ we will explore the difference between token swaps and migration. What Is a Token Swap? Otherwise known as a “coin swap/” a token swap is the process of exchanging one token for another token. For example/ when you deposit USDT on a decentralized exchange (DEX) and get ETH in return/ you are conducting a token swap. Token swaps usually happen within the same blockchain. However/ there may be instances where they happen between two different blockchains. This is known as cross-chain token swaps. A cross-chain token swap happens when you move your tokens from one blockchain to another. This is usually facilitated via blockchain bridges/ which lock a token on one blockchain while minting a wrapped version of the token on another. For example/ if you want to spend your ETH on the BNB Smart Chain (BSC)/ you can use the Binance bridge to lock up your Ether on the Ethereum network while you receive wrapped Ether (wETH) tokens on BSC. The same process can be used to unwrap your wETH to receive your ETH back on the Ethereum blockchain. In the case of regular token swaps/ which happen on the same blockchain/ you are essentially selling a token that you already own and buying an equivalent value of another token. Both regular and cross-chain token swaps can be done through a centralized or decentralized exchange/ with each type offering pros and cons. What Is Token Migration? While a token swap essentially involves exchanging one existing token for another/ token migration refers to the process of “moving” tokens from one blockchain to another. It is worth mentioning that in token migration/ the replacement token typically begins to exist based on the execution of the swap. A token migration usually occurs when a project decides to switch to a different blockchain platform/ usually due to the benefits that the new blockchain offers/ such as faster transaction speeds or lower fees. In this process/ the old tokens on the original blockchain are burned or locked up/ and new tokens are created on the new blockchain. Holders of the old tokens are required to migrate their tokens to the new blockchain to receive the new tokens. Unlike token swaps/ which can be performed by an individual holder/ a token migration is typically conducted at a project level. For instance/ it is possible to swap your ETH to AVAX using a CEX. However/ it is not possible for you/ as an individual/ to migrate your tokens from the Ethereum blockchain to Avalanche. At best/ you can use a cross-chain bridge to wrap your tokens/ which is still a token swap. Why Are Token Swaps Important? To put things in perspective/ there are more than 23/000 cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap today. While some are not active anymore — there are also many that have a thriving ecosystem and active users. Besides being “in for the tech/” one of the main reasons why people get involved in the crypto market is speculation with the anticipation of future returns. Let’s assume you are 100% certain that the price of the hypothetical token “XYZ” will surge to $100/000 by tomorrow. Chances are that you will liquidate your position in other cryptocurrencies to buy more “XYZ”. Similarly/ you’d probably rush to sell all your “ABC” tokens if news breaks that the project is a scam and the founders have absconded. While these are extreme examples/ there are a number of reasons why investors choose to swap their tokens. For one/ they may strongly believe in the future of the project and want to gain exposure to that particular token. Or/ they may need to react quickly to negative news about a particular token in their portfolio. Given the volatile and dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market/ swapping tokens allow investors to take advantage of the most attractive opportunities. Token swapping allows investors to quickly trade their current token for another. Why Do Projects Conduct Token Migration? It is not usual for blockchain projects to migrate from one blockchain to another. As a matter of fact/ this was a common practice between 2018 and 2020. During the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) boom of late 2017 and early 2018/ thousands of cryptocurrency projects were launched on the Ethereum network/ adopting its ERC-20 token standard. ICO is a fundraising mechanism used by crypto startups. During an ICO/ a new cryptocurrency is created and sold to investors in exchange for existing cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum/ or even fiat currency like USD. In most cases/ these crypto startups promise investors that the issued tokens will have a future use case within their own native blockchain. As a result/ these tokens are transferred/ aka “migrated/” from a blockchain like Ethereum to their own chains upon completion. Think of it as living in a rented apartment temporarily until you save up enough money to buy a house. Examples of Token Migration A number of prominent projects like TRON/ BNB and CRO have conducted mainnet swaps and token migrations in the past/ moving from the Ethereum chain to their own native blockchains. More recently/ internet-of-things protocol Helium successfully migrated its IOT token to the Solana blockchain/ with the goal of making it cheaper and faster to operate on Helium. How To Perform a Token Swap There are generally four ways to conduct a token swap depending on the type. Regular swaps can be done using centralized exchanges like Binance and Coinbase/ decentralized exchanges like Uniswap and PancakeSwap/ or directly within wallet apps like MetaMask and Phantom. Cross-chain token swaps/ on the other hand/ require blockchain bridges. Some popular examples are Celer cBridge/ AnySwap/ Cross-Chain Bridge/ Multichain/ Portal Token Bridge (formerly Wormhole)/ Synapse/ Hop Protocol/ Stargate Finance and more. How To Perform a Token Migration Remember that a token migration cannot be conducted at an individual level. This decision needs to first come from the developers of the project/ and they will decide how the token migration process should go. There are several ways this can play out. You may be required to handle the token migration process by yourself if you self-custody the tokens. This doesn’t necessarily mean that you need to have any background in tech. User experience in the crypto space has improved significantly over the past few years and migrating a self-held token can be as easy as just a few clicks. Most projects will create tools to assist holders with the migration process. Other projects may decide to take a snapshot of the wallets of token holders and automatically airdrop the replacement tokens on the succeeding chain. This approach does not require any active participation from token holders. Alternatively/ if your tokens are held on a centralized exchange/ there is a high probability that the exchange will handle the token migration process on your behalf. Conclusion Although it may be used interchangeably/ a token swap is quite different from a token migration. While a token swap involves selling or locking up one asset to purchase another asset/ token migration is the transfer of tokens from one blockchain to another. Furthermore/ token swaps are conducted at an individual level while migrations are carried out at a project level.

Someone checked the chain and there are wallets that bought both PEPE and SHIB early: View post on Twitter Might want to bookmark these three addresses. Was there anything else worth talking about other than memecoins and their effects? Not really. But Jason Lowery had a nice thread about why Bitcoin is a great tool for national cybersecurity: View post on Twitter Ok yea/ Jason/ nice. But hear us out: altcoins on the Bitcoin blockchain. Wisdom of the Week Lots of wisdom in the timeline last week. One nugget came from Hsaka: View post on Twitter You can (or don't want to) never leave indeed. This is most probably not the last memecoin mania either. If you missed this one/ don’t beat yourself up. Because it’s not about the millions. Who Is Arguing in Way Too Public a Place? Another week/ another memecoin rug. This time WSB Coin was on the end of some drama: View post on Twitter As it always goes/ out came the pitchforks and doxxing threats: View post on Twitter How did this one end? Apparently with funds recovered. Good for them: View post on Twitter Elon Building Twitter Surely/ with all this madness going on/ Elon would put on his memecoin shitlord suit and jump right in? Nope! A really quiet week for Chief Twit. No drama/ no major Twitter updates/ no crypto. Just Elon enjoying some family time at the F1 race: View post on Twitter Just kidding/ how could Elon not cause a memecoin to pump? He replied to Beeple’s incomprehensible tweet/ causing GPT-created memecoin TURBO to pump: View post on Twitter Talk of the Town Ok. So. Uhm/ where do we start here… We covered this entire Pepe-to-the-moon story in an extra article: Is Memecoin Szn Back? But that was last Wednesday. So now it’s time for an update and/ obviously/ everyone wants to know: wen short? Well/ the top may or may not be already in. Jack Niewold thinks it’s not: View post on Twitter PEPE is a wonderful reminder about what crypto stands for: View post on Twitter Imagine this: PEPE even started onboarding those people to DeFi that refused to use its infrastructure for years. Like millionaire crypto influencers: View post on Twitter Crazy/ isn’t it? But still/ there are some good people left in crypto- People with integrity that do not put money first. People like jaredfromsubway.eth: View post on Twitter This memecoin tsunami is so strong/ it even washes over Bitcoin dinosaurs and laser eye maxis that want to keep the chain clean of nasty “transactions.” Yes/ that really happened: View post on Twitter Bitcoiners are in shock and disbelief over this DDoS attack: View post on Twitter The horror! Someone is *gasp* using Bitcoin. Binance temporarily suspended withdrawals to cope with this onslaught of usage. That makes the proposed tax on Bitcoin miners even more lucrative: View post on Twitter Now that everyone has submitted to the Pepe standard and we agree money isn’t real/ it doesn’t matter if we burn millions/ right? Then we can consider Balaji a foreward-thinking pioneer: View post on Twitter Memes The memes were pretty obvious last week.

Even though they are highly technical/ it is still useful to understand how these wallets work and what their use cases are. TL;DR: \"Multi-Party Computation\" (MPC) wallets are an innovation in crypto storage/ using cryptographic protocols to split and distribute private keys among multiple parties securely without revealing them to others. Private keys are split into “shares” and distributed to each party that has control over the wallet/ ensuring that no single party can control the wallet. Transactions can be authorized by multiple shares/ not all/ enhancing the security and availability of the wallet/ while eliminating single points of failure.

Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox/ along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right/ millions love us!) — what are you waiting for? What Are Multi-Party Computation (MPC) Wallets? Multi-party computation wallets are crypto wallets using MPC technology to manage and store users’ assets securely. MPC is a cryptographic protocol that allows multiple parties to perform computations on their data without revealing it to each other or a third party. For example/ three parties can calculate their average salary without disclosing their individual salaries. While the concept of MPC has been around since the 80s/ it has only entered the crypto space in recent years/ allowing wallet providers and custodians to securely store crypto assets. In an MPC wallet/ the private keys which users require to access and manage their crypto assets are split into multiple parts known as \"shares\". These are subsequently distributed among the parties involved in the MPC protocol. As a result/ no single party can control or compromise the wallet. Moreover/ transactions can be authorized by attaining a required threshold of shares instead of requiring all or none of the shares. This eliminates a single point of failure and enhances the security and availability of the wallet. How MPC Wallets Differ From Regular Wallets MPC wallets differ from regular wallets such as single-key/ multi-signature or hardware wallets. Single-key wallets rely on one private key that can be easily lost or stolen. Hence/ MPC wallets are more secure in that regard. Multi-signature wallets require multiple signatures from different devices or parties which can make the process cumbersome or affect the availability of the wallet in time-sensitive situations. Moreover/ MPC wallets are protocol-agnostic and maintain the signers' privacy. They're also cheaper since only one transaction signature is necessary. Finally/ hardware wallets depend on physical devices that can be damaged. They are also not suited for use cases where more than one participant is required to authorize transactions. Benefits of MPC Wallets MPC wallets offer several benefits/ such as: Decentralization MPC wallets do not require any trusted third party to store or access the private keys/ as they are distributed among the multiple parties involved in the MPC protocol. This reduces the risk of centralization/ corruption or collusion that may compromise the security or availability of the stored assets. Data Privacy MPC wallets protect the users' data privacy too/ as they do not reveal any private information or secret data to each other or to a third party. This ensures that no one can access or tamper with the users’ data without their consent or knowledge. High Accuracy MPC wallets also provide high accuracy for different computations using cryptography. This means they can perform complex operations such as generating addresses/ signing transactions and verifying signatures without errors or inconsistencies. Removes Single Points of Failure MPC wallets eliminate single points of failure that may exist in other types of wallets/ such as single-key/ multi-signature or hardware wallets. These types of wallets may suffer from loss or theft of private keys/ unavailability of key parties/ malfunction of devices/ or hacking or phishing attacks. MPC wallets overcome these challenges by splitting and distributing the private keys among the multiple parties involved in the MPC protocol. Scalability MPC wallets enable scalability by allowing users to add or remove parties from the MPC protocol without affecting its functionality. Users can adjust their security and performance levels according to their needs and preferences. For example/ users can increase their security by adding more parties to the protocol. Flexibility MPC wallets offer increased flexibility by enabling dynamic policies and workflows for managing digital assets. Users can set different thresholds for authorizing transactions depending on various factors such as amount/ frequency/ destination address and more. Users can modify these thresholds at any time without affecting existing transactions/ and create contingency plans in case any of the required parties become unavailable. Compliance MPC wallets support compliance with global regulations and industry standards for digital asset custody. Users can comply with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements by verifying identities and sources of funds before initiating transactions They can also adhere to audit and reporting obligations by providing transparent records and logs of transactions/ as well as follow industry best practices for security and governance through their policies and procedures. Risks of MPC Wallets MPC Wallets also have some risks you should be aware of/ such as: High Communication Costs MPC wallets require a lot of communication between the parties involved in the MPC protocol. This can increase the bandwidth usage and the network latency of the devices involved in the process. It can also expose them to network attacks such as denial-of-service (DoS) or man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. Technical Complexity MPC wallets rely on advanced cryptographic techniques and distributed computing that are hard to understand and implement correctly. This can lead to bugs/ errors or vulnerabilities in the code or the protocol that can compromise the security or functionality of the wallet. Not Open-Source or Interoperable Most conventional wallets like Ledger and Trezor are incompatible with MPC wallets. MPC algorithms are not standardized and the solutions are not open-source/ which makes them difficult to use for retail customers. Popular MPC Wallets Some of the popular MPC wallets include: ZenGo ZenGo is one of the most popular and user-friendly MPC wallets for individuals and small teams. It offers buying and selling crypto with fiat/ biometric authentication/ backup and recovery features/ 24/7 live customer service/ supports over 70 different cryptocurrencies/ and allows users to use their favorite decentralized applications (DApps) through Wallet Connect. Fireblocks Fireblocks is one of the most trusted and secure MPC wallets for institutional investors. It supports over 40 blockchain protocols and 1/100 tokens and integrates with major exchanges and protocols. It also offers enterprise-grade security features such as insurance coverage up to $150 million per wallet/ multi-factor authentication/ role-based permissions and audit logs. Coinbase Coinbase/ one of the largest and most well-known crypto centralized exchange (CEX) platforms/ also offers an MPC wallet solution for institutional clients. It supports over 90 cryptocurrencies and provides access to the Coinbase Pro trading platform. Qredo Qredo is a new and innovative MPC wallet platform enabling institutional investors cross-chain liquidity. It supports over 20 blockchain protocols and allows users to transfer assets across different blockchains without intermediaries or fees. It also offers advanced security features such as decentralized governance and atomic settlement. How To Choose an MPC Wallet An MPC wallet will not be for most users. But in the event that you choose to get one/ you should keep the following two tips in mind: 1. Know your use case Different MPC wallets cater to different types of users/ such as individuals/ small teams or institutional users. Depending on your use case/ you may have different requirements for security/ performance/ functionality and cost. 2. Compare features and services Different MPC wallets offer different features and services that can enhance your crypto experience. For example/ some MPC wallets offer buying and selling crypto with fiat/ biometric authentication or more granular access controls. Compare the features and services of different MPC wallets and see which ones match your preferences and goals.

Keep your coins safe from this new sneaky crypto scam!","title":"Address Poisoning Attacks: What They Are and How To Stay Safe | CoinMarketCap","detailedContent":"In early 2023/ a new type of cryptocurrency attack rose to prominence/ known simply as “address poisoning.” The premise of the attack is simple: trick the target into sending funds to the attacker's address by forming transactions designed to confuse the target. The attack was first spotted in December 2022 but has since grown dramatically in frequency/ with somewhere in the order of $5 to $10 million lost to the scam — a number still growing to this day. At least $2.8 million has been stolen from users on BNB Chain/ the majority of which is in the form of USD Coin (USDC) or Tether (USDT). At least 1/000 unique users have now fallen victim to the attack. Most major blockchains are now being used to carry out the attack. To date/ tens of millions of active addresses have been targeted by address poisoning attacks. There are several ways this scam is orchestrated. We’ll cover two of the most common below. Method 1: Fake Contracts In the first example/ the attacker creates a smart contract that sends tokens with zero amounts to an address that is similar to the victim's address. The first time the victim sees this transaction/ they may not pay much attention to it. However/ the next time the victim tries to make a legitimate transfer/ they may inadvertently copy the phishing address from the transaction history on Etherscan or their wallet app/ instead of the intended recipient address. This mistake results in the victim transferring their cryptocurrency to the attacker's address. This address is designed to closely match the victim’s/ with the first (and often last) several characters matching exactly. These are typically the only characters shown by wallets and explorers for brevity purposes. As such/ most people only know the first and last few characters of their wallet. In some variations of this scam/ the attacker uses a fake token contract and transfers a significant sum of said token to the target. This will usually be a fake version of a popular token/ such as USDT or USDC. The attacker can then use a transaction that calls this token contract's transferFrom function to make it appear that the target address transfers 0 of these tokens to the receiver (the attacker's address). This is used to increase the odds that the victim will copy the last receiver's address/ believing that they have already transacted with this address in the past. Some block explorers now hide these transactions by default/ but many in-app transaction logs and explorers will still show these transactions. View post on Twitter Method 2: Breadcrumbing In the second example/ the attacker creates a vanity address that is very similar to the victim's address. They then send very small amounts of cryptocurrency to the victim's address/ hoping that the victim will check the balance on a block explorer and see the attacker's address in the transaction history. The attacker hopes that when you see a transaction for a token you typically interact with in your transaction history/ you might copy the recipient address (thinking it is your own) and then send funds to that address. As you might expect/ sending a small amount of funds to thousands of wallets can be expensive. In total/ attackers have spent millions of dollars in transaction fees carrying out attacks on the Ethereum blockchain alone. These attacks can be difficult to detect because the transactions appear legitimate and may not trigger any warnings. However/ victims can protect themselves by always double-checking the recipient's address before sending any cryptocurrency. How To Stay Safe From Address Poisoning Attacks? Unfortunately/ there is nothing you can do to prevent yourself from being targeted by an address poisoning attack. The attackers tend to target anybody that transacts regularly and/or frequently sends or receives large sums. If you find yourself the victim of an address poisoning attack/ your best course of action is to simply arm yourself with an understanding of how they work so that you don’t fall victim to one. Then/ it’s best to simply ignore transactions associated with address poisoning attacks. Besides this/ there are a handful of transaction hygiene practices you can follow to minimize your chances of being duped. These include: Set up alerts: Several tools allow you to set up alerts to notify you when your address transacts or interacts with specific smart contracts. These can be used to confirm your usual transactions (allowing you to ignore anything else) or flag suspicious transactions involving your address. Create a contact list: Address poisoning attacks work by tricking you into sending funds to a wallet that you think is your own or somebody you transact with regularly. You can completely eliminate the risk of falling victim to this attack by adding wallets you regularly transact with to your contact list. Almost every major cryptocurrency wallet now has a contact list or address book. Use a trusted source: Use a trusted source to obtain the recipient's address. This could include using an official website/ social media account or other verified communication channels. Avoid clicking on links or using addresses obtained from untrusted sources/ and never use previous transactions to identify the recipient's address without double-checking first. Use a name service: Name service addresses such as those provided by the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) or BSC Name Service (BNS) can provide an additional layer of protection since they are impossible to duplicate and their short length makes them much harder to spoof. For a more technical solution/ some Web3 wallets allow you to filter transactions by contract address or whitelist only specific contract addresses. You can then find the official contract address for your target tokens on its CoinMarketCap coin detail page. Popular options include MyEtherWallet (MEW) and Exodus. Many block explorers will automatically label these transactions as suspicious or as likely phishing attacks/ but this generally takes some time. As such/ it’s not a reliable way to determine if a transaction is an address-poisoning attack — particularly if the transaction is very recent.

But if you're reading this article/ you may not know it. So we'll clear it up for you: What are coins and what are tokens? The difference between coins and tokens. Examples of coins and tokens. Subscribe Join us in showcasing the cryptocurrency revolution/ one newsletter at a time. Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox/ along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right/ millions love us!) — what are you waiting for? What Is a Coin? Coins are cryptocurrencies belonging to a blockchain. They are independent of other chains and cannot be used on other chains in their native form. The use cases of coins are: Medium of exchange Store of value Unit of account Some of the most popular coins are Bitcoin/ Ethereum and Dogecoin. Read also: Can Bitcoin become money? A coin is produced through mining/ meaning (in its easiest form) computers solve complex math puzzles and validate transactions to produce coins. The first computer to solve the problem gets rewarded with newly minted coins. This ensures that the network is secure and decentralized. Some of the characteristics and benefits of coins are: Decentralization: Coins are not controlled by any central authority or intermediary. They are governed by the rules of their protocol and the consensus of their community. This gives users more freedom and privacy over their transactions and funds. Security: Coins are protected by cryptography and encryption. They are resistant to hacking/ censorship and fraud. Users can trust that their coins are safe and authentic/ without relying on third parties. Scarcity: Most coins have a limited supply that is predetermined by their algorithm. This creates a deflationary effect that increases its value over time. For example/ Bitcoin has a total supply of 21 million and Ethereum is deflationary. However/ not all coins are scarce/ such as Dogecoin/ which has no cap on its supply. Coins are like digital commodities. Read our explainer about digital commodities to understand how they work. Coins can vary based on how they are created/ their value and the function they fulfill. Here are some examples of coin types: Native Coins: These are coins that run on their own blockchain and serve as the main currency of the network. Examples include Bitcoin (BTC)/ Ethereum (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC). Forked Coins: These are coins that are derived from an existing blockchain by splitting or branching off from it. Examples include Bitcoin Cash (BCH)/ Bitcoin SV (BSV) and Ethereum Classic (ETC). Wrapped Coins: These are coins that represent another asset on a different blockchain. They allow users to access cross-chain functionality and liquidity. Examples include Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)/ Wrapped Ether (WETH). Stablecoins: These are coins that are pegged to the value of another asset/ such as fiat currency or gold. They aim to provide price stability and reduce volatility. Examples include Tether (USDT)/ USD Coin (USDC). What Is a Token? Tokens sit on top of an existing blockchain and depend on it for their operation. A token can represent various things/ such as utility/ governance rights/ shares of ownership or others. Tokens are usually “pre-mined/” meaning developers use a smart contract to issue new tokens and distribute them to users. Some of the characteristics and benefits of tokens are: Utility: Tokens are necessary to use the decentralized applications (dApps) they are built for. Users can use tokens to pay for fees/ perform actions/ or receive benefits. Governance: Tokens can give users a voice in the decision-making process of the blockchain or dApp. Users can use tokens to vote on proposals/ changes/ or upgrades. Interoperability: Tokens can enable cross-chain communication and compatibility. Unlike coins/ tokens can be supported by different blockchains. Tokens are like digital currency for the protocol offering them. They can grant users access/ rights or rewards. There are different types of tokens based on their function/ value proposition/ use cases/ etc. Here are some examples of token types: Utility Tokens: They provide access to a service or function on the blockchain or dApp. Examples include Uniswap (UNI) and Chainlink (LINK). Governance Tokens: They give users a say in the governance of the blockchain or dApp. Examples include Maker (MKR)/ Compound (COMP)/ Aave (AAVE)/ and most other tokens. Security Tokens: They represent a share of ownership or a claim on an asset or income stream. They are subject to securities regulations and compliance. Examples include Polymath (POLY). Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs): They represent unique and indivisible digital items/ such as art and collectibles. They are not interchangeable and have varying values. Examples include CryptoPunks and Bored Apes. Coins vs Tokens: The Difference Now that we know what coins and tokens are/ let's see how they differ from each other. Here is a feature-by-feature comparison of coins and tokens: Coins are more suitable for general transactions and value preservation/ while tokens are more suitable for specific purposes and value creation. However/ this does not mean that coins and tokens are mutually exclusive or incompatible. In fact/ they can work together and complement each other in the crypto ecosystem. For example: Users can use coins to buy tokens or use tokens to pay for fees on coin networks. Users can wrap coins into tokens or unwrap tokens into coins to access cross-chain functionality and liquidity. Users can stake coins or tokens to earn rewards or participate in governance. Users can swap coins or tokens with each other using decentralized exchanges (DEXs) or automated market makers (AMMs). Popular Coins and Tokens Let's talk about some popular crypto coins and tokens. Popular Crypto Coins Bitcoin (BTC): Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency and thus the first coin. It has risen to popularity/ thanks to it being the most secure and decentralized network/ with thousands of nodes and miners around the world. Read also: Is Bitcoin the next world reserve currency? Ethereum (ETH): Ether is the coin of the Ethereum blockchain. It fulfills the same function as a medium of exchange and unit of account as Bitcoin. Unlike Bitcoin/ Ethereum allows for smart contract functionality and the development of decentralized applications (DApps). Read also: Everything you need to know about the Shanghai Upgrade. Binance Coin (BNB): Binance Coin can be used to pay for discounted trading fees/ participate in token sales/ and access various services and functions in the Binance ecosystem. It also has a limited supply that is periodically burned/ creating a deflationary effect that increases its value over time. Read also: Binance Marketplace: the new crypto super app. Dogecoin (DOGE): Doge is based on the image of a Shiba Inu dog and has a loyal and enthusiastic fan base. It is often used for tipping/ donating or expressing support on social media platforms. It is also famous for Elon Musk being its unofficial champion and most famous supporter. Read also: Elon changes Twitter logo to Doge Popular Crypto Tokens Tether (USDT): Tether is the biggest stablecoin/ meaning its value is bound to the value of the dollar. It aims to provide price stability and reduce volatility in the crypto market. It is often used as a medium of exchange or a store of value between different cryptocurrencies or platforms. Read also: Why do stablecoins depeg? Uniswap (UNI): UNI is the governance token of the Uniswap protocol. Uniswap is a decentralized exchanged for swapping tokens between different EVM-compatible blockchains. Read also: Uniswap vs PancakeSwap Arbitrum (ARB): ARB is the governance token of Arbitrum/ a layer-two blockchain for Ethereum. Arbitrum was created by the Arbitrum Foundation and launched with one of the biggest airdrops in the history of cryptocurrency.

Strap in/ a short but hard-hitting round-up of Crypto Twitter’s interesting last week. Whose Threads Are A Must-Read? A bit of a quiet week on the thread front/ but there were still a few gems. Emperor Osmo reminded us that the Cosmos ecosystem/ the overlooked wallflower among L1s/ is still there and building. He wrote up a thread of 15 reasons to be bullish on it: View post on Twitter There are a bunch of appchains launching on Cosmos and it boasts a strong security model. Is that going to be enough for a pump? Probably not in the short run but who knows what could happen in the next bull market. Read also our Deep Dive Into the Cosmos Ecosystem to learn more about it. Tokens that definitely do pump are those the Korean market bids for. Miles Deutscher came in with a handy thread about how to spot Korea pumps early: View post on Twitter Even when the market goes sideways/ there are opportunities to profit when you’re early. But how do you know when we’re just crabbing sideways and when it’s a dip in a bull market? Zero Ika explains it all in his thread about market structures and how to spot them: View post on Twitter Try spotting what kind of market we’re in now (pro-tip: there’s no right answer). Finally/ Crypto Twitter OG punk6529 came in with a massive story thread about collecting art. Well/ not only about collecting art but about the art and science of collecting and when to buy: View post on Twitter A wonderful thread that should give you insight into how whales operate when buying assets. Wisdom Of The Week Some people wonder whether crypto isn’t just greater fool's investment. Maybe. But definitely not all of crypto. Degenerate Spartan summarized how crypto investing works in this handy chart: View post on Twitter Laugh all you want but right-curvers and left-curvers agree. Submit to the narrative if you want to be rewarded. Elon Building Twitter Elon took a well-deserved break from drama and shitposting and mostly focused on the launch of a new SpaceX starship last week. But it wasn’t all rocket launches. He didn’t miss the obligatory dig at a publicly funded broadcaster: View post on Twitter Talk of the Town The talk of the town last week was undoubtedly the grilling of Gary Gensler at the congressional hearing. Our man Gary got roasted: View post on Twitter If you missed it/ we wrote a full breakdown of how Gary Gensler got grilled and what that means for the crypto industry.

Exhibit A/ Do Kwon’s hardware wallet security: View post on Twitter No/ never a dull week in crypto. But prices didn’t dump because they excavated coins from Do Kwon’s you know what. In fact/ Justin Sun suspects there is another reason for that: View post on Twitter Either way/ one surefire way to never have to rely on market prices is spinning up your own NFT or shitcoin scam. Rappers like Soulja Boy have caught on to this fact. But he didn’t have ZachXBT on his radar: View post on Twitter But Soulja Boy isn’t the only one cashing in on a scam. So did this lucky buyer of PEPE last week/ printing a cool million from only 250 quid: View post on Twitter Yes/ sometimes you can win in the casino. As long as you remember that in the end/ it’s always the house that wins.

Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox/ along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right/ millions love us!) — what are you waiting for? What Is an AppChain and How Does It Work? An appchain is a blockchain designed for a specific application. It can be seen as a specialized layer-1 solution that connects to a general layer-0 solution. The layer-0 solution provides the basic infrastructure and interoperability for the appchains/ while the appchains provide the customized functionality and performance for the apps. The benefit of appchains is greater freedom and control for developers. Additionally/ they inherit the security and scalability of the layer-0 they are connected to. Blockchain ecosystems may choose an appchain architecture for different reasons. Scalability Applications do not have to compete for block space in an appchain system. This improves the performance and throughput of the applications/ as well as reduces the congestion and fees on the main network. Customization In an appchain system/ developers are free to choose a consensus mechanism/ governance structures and economic models. This gives developers more freedom and creativity to design their applications. Interoperability Applications can communicate and exchange value across the broader ecosystem/ thanks to common protocols and standards. This creates a more connected and diverse ecosystem of applications. Innovation Developers are free to experiment with new economic and governance models without adversely impacting the main chain. This fosters a more dynamic and collaborative environment for development. Which Blockchains Use AppChains? There are different ways to implement appchains/ but two of the most prominent examples are Cosmos and Polkadot. Cosmos works as the “internet of blockchains” with the Cosmos SDK and the Tendermint consensus mechanism at its core. Appchains are called “zones” and connect to the Cosmos main chain/ creating an interconnected web of chains. Some examples of appchains built on Cosmos are: Akash Network: A decentralized cloud computing platform that leverages unused computing capacity to provide affordable and censorship-resistant cloud services. Osmosis: A decentralized exchange platform that allows users to create and trade custom liquidity pools across different zones. Another example is Polkadot/ which also uses a network of heterogeneous blockchains. These so-called parachains are connected to the Relay Chain/ the central chain of the Polkadot network. Similar to Cosmos/ this results in shared security without sacrificing scalability. It also facilitates the exchange of value for parachains. Some examples of appchains built on Polkadot are: Acala: A decentralized finance hub that offers a multi-collateralized stablecoin/ a trustless staking derivative/ and a decentralized exchange platform. Litentry: A cross-chain identity aggregator/ which offers decentralized identity verification and reputation management. Comparing AppChains to Other Blockchains Appchains typically focus on one application in a wider web of blockchains. How does this compare to other blockchain architectures? Appchains vs Monolithic Chains Monolithic chains are all-in-one solutions where all functionality/ including applications/ is executed on the base layer. Examples of monolithic chains include Bitcoin and Ethereum 1.0. These types of chains have several advantages: Simplicity: Monolithic chains don't rely on external parties or protocols to operate/ reducing network complexity. Security: With a smaller attack surface/ monolithic chains generally offer greater security. Decentralization and Immutability: All nodes follow the same rules and validate the same transactions/ ensuring a high degree of decentralization. However/ monolithic chains also come with significant disadvantages: Scalability: Limited resources and bandwidth restrict the number of transactions and data storage/ leading to network congestion and high fees. Flexibility and Innovation: Upgrading or customizing the platform can be difficult without affecting or depending on existing applications. Appchains differ from monolithic chains in several ways: On appchains/ one application uses all the blockspace but on monolithic chains/ there are multiple applications. Monolithic chains provide security for other applications/ while appchains leverage the security of a layer-0 chain. Appchains are flexible in terms of customization/ while monolithic chains have fixed and rigid parameters for their platform. AppChains vs Modular Chains Modular chains split their core functions into separate layers or components/ including consensus/ execution/ data availability and settlement. Examples of modular chains include Ethereum 2.0 and Solana. These chains offer several benefits: Scalability: Modular chains can process more transactions and store more data by using parallelization and specialization techniques. Resource Optimization: By outsourcing some tasks to other layers or chains/ modular chains can optimize their resources and bandwidth. However/ modular chains also face some drawbacks: Complexity: Modular chains depend on external parties or protocols to operate/ which increases network complexity. Security: The increased attack surface and reliance on external parties can present security concerns. Decentralization Trade-offs: Different layers or chains may have varying levels of trust and validation/ impacting overall decentralization. Appchains share some similarities with modular chains but also have key differences: Appchains still dedicate blockspace to a specific application/ while modular chains run multiple applications. Appchains connect to a general layer-0 solution/ whereas modular chains use specialized layer-1 or layer-2 solutions. AppChains vs Layer-2 Chains Layer-2 chains are scaling solutions that operate on top of a layer-1 blockchain/ handling some or all of the execution and settlement functions of a network. Examples of layer-2s include Optimism and Arbitrum. Layer-2 chains offer a number of advantages: Speed: Compression and aggregation techniques allow layer-2s to process more transactions and charge lower fees. Faster finality: Layer-2s can provide faster finality and confirmation times by using optimistic or zero-knowledge proofs. However/ layer-2s also come with some limitations: Dependency: Layer-2s rely on the layer-1 blockchain for consensus and data availability/ which can limit their autonomy and sovereignty. Security Risks: Layer-2s have the potential for fraud or censorship by malicious actors due to their dependence on the layer-1 blockchain. Appchains differ from layer-2s in several ways: Appchains handle all core functions on their own chain/ while layer-2s handle some or all of the execution and settlement functions on their platform. Appchains connect to a general layer-0 solution/ instead of operating on top of a specific layer-1 blockchain. AppChains vs Sidechains Sidechains are blockchains that are compatible with another blockchain. They handle all core functions on their own chain but do not use the security or scalability of the other blockchain. Examples of sidechains include Polygon. Sidechains offer several benefits: Performance: Sidechains can process more transactions and store more data by using their own resources and bandwidth. Flexibility: Sidechains can customize their parameters and features according to their needs and preferences. However/ sidechains also face some challenges: Security: Not relying on the security or scalability of the other blockchain exposes sidechains to more attacks and vulnerabilities. Interoperability: Sidechains may face difficulties in communicating and exchanging value with the other blockchain/ as they require bridges or adapters to enable cross-chain transactions. Appchains have some similarities and differences with sidechains: AppChains and sidechains both have their own native tokens and governance models and handle all core functions on their chains. AppChains leverage the security and scalability of a larger network/ while sidechains do not. AppChains connect to a general layer-0 solution/ while sidechains are compatible with a specific blockchain. Popular AppChains Many appchains are either live or in development/ but here are some of the most notable ones: Osmosis Osmosis is a decentralized exchange platform that allows users to create and trade custom liquidity pools across different zones in the Cosmos network. It is an appchain built on Cosmos using the Cosmos SDK and Tendermint. It has its own native token (OSMO) and governance model and leverages the security and interoperability of the Cosmos Hub. Osmosis offers users and developers a high-performance and customizable platform for automated market-making and liquidity provision. Litentry Litentry is a decentralized identity aggregator that enables users to link their identities across different blockchains and platforms. It is an appchain built on Polkadot using Substrate and parachains. Litentry has its own native token (LIT) and governance model/ and it leverages the security and interoperability of the Relay Chain. It offers users and developers a privacy-preserving and cross-chain platform for identity verification and reputation management. dYdX dYdX is a decentralized margin trading platform that allows users to trade perpetual contracts and spot markets with leverage. It is an appchain built on Ethereum using StarkWare's zero-knowledge rollup technology. It has its own native token (DYDX) and governance model and leverages the security and data availability of Ethereum. dYdX offers users and developers a fast and low-cost platform for advanced trading features and derivatives. Acala Acala is a decentralized finance hub that offers a multi-collateralized stablecoin/ a trustless staking derivative/ and a decentralized exchange platform. It is an appchain built on Polkadot using Substrate and parachains. It has its own native token (ACA) and governance model and leverages the security and interoperability of the Relay Chain. Acala offers users and developers a fast and low-cost platform for Web3 finance applications and assets.

Look no further! Here is a guide on how to participate in the crypto market with no money!","title":"How To Participate in the Crypto Market With No Money in 2023 | CoinMarketCap","detailedContent":"Cryptocurrencies are one of the most profitable asset class of the last decade/ with major digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC)/ Ethereum (ETH) and BNB providing early investors with staggering returns. They’re also notoriously volatile. The average cryptocurrency can see its value fluctuate more in a day than traditional equities do in a year. In light of this/ not everyone has the financial flexibility or risk tolerance necessary to safely invest money into cryptocurrencies. Fortunately/ there are more than a handful of ways to earn and profit from cryptocurrencies with little to no investment required (not financial advice). Let’s have a look at some of the popular methods! Subscribe Join us in showcasing the cryptocurrency revolution/ one newsletter at a time. Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox/ along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right/ millions love us!) — what are you waiting for? Airdrop Airdrops are by far the most popular way to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies without any investment. As the name suggests/ these are free token distribution programs designed to reward early participation in an ecosystem/ diversify and increase the number of token holders/ and increase the amount of buzz surrounding the project. Though chances of airdrops could be highly speculative/ the barrier to entry is usually extremely low/ and the number of different airdrops available is high. Because of this/ the total value you can earn from airdrop can be significant. Moreover/ several airdrops have provided lucrative returns to investors. These include: Aptos: This layer-1 blockchain airdropped APT tokens to participants in its incentivized testnet or APTOS:ZERO Testnet NFT minters. Some users received over $1/000 in APT. Uniswap: Anybody who had used Uniswap before the airdrop snapshot date was eligible to claim 400 UNI tokens after its token generation event. At its peak/ these were worth over $17/600. Arbitrum: One of the more recent airdrops/ early users of the Arbitrum ecosystem received a variable amount of ARB tokens. Some addresses received up to 10/250 ARB/ worth over $100/000 at its peak. Decred: Regarded as one of the most profitable airdrops of all time. At its peak/ each airdrop participant received over $60/000 worth of DCR tokens. In most cases/ airdrops can be earned or claimed free of charge. But in some cases/ it can be more challenging to meet the airdrop eligibility requirements. For example/ many of the more profitable airdrops require you to be an early participant in the surrounding ecosystem — e.g. by providing liquidity/ conducting transactions/ and interacting with DApps. These aren’t a direct cost if they’re part-and-parcel of your regular activity/ but in many cases/ users will increase their activity just to maximize their rewards. Keep track of the latest exclusive airdrops here. Learn and Earn Initiatives The cryptocurrency industry is vast and still remains poorly understood by the masses. To help tackle this/ a number of projects and platforms have launched some form of a ‘learn and earn’ initiative — which sees users earn rewards in the form of cryptocurrencies for brushing up on their general crypto knowledge or learning about a specific product or project. Here at CoinMarketCap/ we have our very own CMC Earn platform. This allows users to earn crypto rewards for watching videos and testing their knowledge about new and established crypto projects. This provides an excellent way to get to grips with cryptocurrencies while providing rewards that may multiply in value over time. A range of other platforms also offers similar opportunities. These include: Coinbase Learning Rewards: Allows users to earn a small amount of different cryptocurrencies (generally ~$3 to ~$15 worth) for taking a short course about the project. This can then be directly traded in the user's Coinbase account. Binance Academy Learn and Earn: Allows users to earn cryptocurrency rewards by improving their blockchain knowledge and participating in simple tasks. BitDegree Learn Drops: By partnering with dozens of Web3 projects/ BitDegree allows users to earn various learn drop rewards by watching educational content and answering quizzes. In most cases/ learn-and-earn programs will only provide a small reward — usually in the order of a few dollars. But over time/ the rewards can stack up. Work in Crypto Simply working in the cryptocurrency industry is arguably the best way to get your hands on cryptocurrencies without investing your money. This is because many Web3 native firms will allow employees or freelancers to receive their salary in crypto. View post on Twitter Depending on the firm/ this might be a specific crypto of your choice/ or one of a range of options — such as BTC/ ETH/ or stablecoins. In some cases/ these cryptocurrencies can go on to accrue value/ providing the holder with potentially significant profit. That said/ they can also fall in value — cutting into your earnings. Fortunately/ the Web3 and cryptocurrency space is always brimming with opportunities/ and there are numerous roles available to choose from — many of which pay well. For a complete look at currently open opportunities in the Web3 space/ see the CoinMarketCap Jobs Board. Run a Node Today/ a large number of cryptocurrency projects operate a permissionless consensus system that allows practically anybody with the requisite hardware to participate in the process of validating transactions or performing other crucial blockchain functions. These network participants are known as node holders and are tasked with running special blockchain client software that allows them to interact with the rest of the network and perform specialized functions. Depending on the platform/ these node holders can have different roles. For example/ POS network node holders are typically involved in block production and transaction confirmation. Whereas node holders in decentralized storage networks might be involved in storing file fragments/ ensuring redundancy/ or providing bandwidth. These networks generally provide users with token rewards/ usually derived from the token emission or a fraction of the fees generated by the network. Some will require you to stake a certain number of the network’s native tokens to begin running a node/ while others have no staking requirement. These include Nano/ Stellar/ and the Bitcoin Lightning Network. However/ node holders will usually need to meet specific hardware and performance requirements. This might include meeting minimum CPU/ hard drive/ and memory requirements/ in addition to bandwidth and uptime standards. The amount you can earn will vary based on the activity of the network and your relative share of its resources/ as well as the value of the reward token. That said/ rewards can be worth the effort — particularly if you already have the hardware available. Join a Testnet Participating in the testnet of new blockchains can be a great way to earn free cryptocurrency with little to no investment required. A testnet is a version of a blockchain that is created specifically for testing purposes. It is a network where developers can experiment with new features/ test the functionality of the network/ and identify and fix any potential bugs or vulnerabilities before deploying its mainnet. To participate in a testnet/ users typically need to download a wallet or client that is specifically designed for the testnet — in many cases/ it simply involves adding the testnet RPC to their pre-existing Web3 wallet. Once they have the wallet set up/ they can then start mining or staking on the network/ or begin interacting with DApps — such as providing liquidity/ minting NFTs/ borrowing/lending funds and more. Many new blockchain projects offer incentives for users to participate in their testnets. These incentives can include free tokens or coins that can be used on the mainnet once it launches/ as well as other rewards such as discounts on future services or products. Recently/ several major blockchains have provided handsome rewards to early testnet participants — including Oasis/ Aptos and Dusk Network. To find out about upcoming testnet opportunities/ users can follow blockchain projects on social media/ join their communities on forums and chat groups/ and stay up to date with industry news and announcements. Note: Some projects hold a clearly defined incentivized testnet program/ whereas others opt to reward testnet participants retroactively. The latter tends to be more profitable since there are fewer participants. Participate in a Free Mint Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have garnered a significant amount of attention in recent years due to both their potential and in many cases/ their desirability. Popular NFT collections like Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC)/ Cryptopunks/ Doodles and Moonbirds have gained significant value since their launch — generating substantial returns for those who purchased one during their initial mint. But while most NFT collections require users to buy their NFTs/ some prominent collections came about by way of a “free mint”. As the name suggests/ this means lucky users were able to get their hands on an NFT for free (barring gas fees). NFT free mints are usually conducted on a first-come-first-served basis/ but some projects opt for a lottery system to determine who can get their hands on a free NFT. Besides free mints/ many NFT projects will give away NFTs to users via competitions or various other initiatives. These are usually advertised on the official project Twitter or community channel. Join a Bug Bounty If you’ve got technical chops or a good amount of free time/ bug bounties can be an excellent way to get your hands on free crypto. Bug bounties come in various shapes in sizes/ but generally involve rewarding users for finding flaws/ vulnerabilities or loopholes in the way a blockchain project or smart contract operates. In return for securely and privately disclosing the issue/ users earn a reward. The size of the reward is generally related to the nature of the vulnerability/ including its severity/ risk level/ and novelty. In the vast majority of cases/ users will need technical knowledge to participate in a bug bounty. This will usually include an excellent understanding of blockchain technology/ programming experience/ and knowledge of a variety of common security vulnerabilities — such as buffer overflow attacks and cross-site scripting (XSS). View post on Twitter In some cases/ the reward for finding a reporting a critical bug can count in the millions of dollars. Some bug bounties might also support non-technical users/ such as those that offer rewards for uncovering or intercepting social engineering attacks/ for promoting the project or assisting it in some other way/ or for offering feedback on the user experience. Platforms like HackenProof/ Immunefi and Bugcrowd can be used to search the range of available bug bounties/ while many individual projects will advertise their bug bounties on their website or socials. Referral Programs Referral programs are an incentivized marketing strategy that encourages existing users to invite their friends and family to join a particular cryptocurrency platform. In return/ both the referrer and the referred user can earn rewards in the form of free cryptocurrencies or other benefits. To participate in a referral program/ users first need to sign up for the cryptocurrency platform they wish to refer their friends to. After creating an account/ they can then access or generate their unique referral link or code that they can share with their friends and family. Some referral programs offer profit-sharing opportunities/ such that the referee earns a fraction of the revenue their referrals bring to the platform. Cryptocurrency exchanges and casinos typically operate using this system/ whereas other platforms — typically cryptocurrency savings and hardware manufacturer platforms — will typically offer a one-off referral fee. Today/ practically every major centralized cryptocurrency exchange offers a referral scheme. Some of the best-known currently include: Binance: The Binance Standard Referral program allows users to earn up to 40% commission on the trading fees generated by their referrals. Coinbase: Coinbase has a very simple affiliate program that allows users to refer their friends/ with both the referrer and the referee earning a $10 reward. ByBit: ByBit's referral program allows users to earn up to 30% of the trading fees generated by qualified referees. There is no limit to how long the commission will be earned. With that in mind/ it’s important to check the terms and conditions associated with referral campaigns/ as they can limit who is eligible and how rewards are paid.

More users and applications are flocking to the network/ leading to congestion and high fees. Optimistic rollups and ZK rollups are some of the most promising ways to increase throughput and lower costs. This article will compare optimistic rollups vs ZK rollups while covering: What rollups are How optimistic rollups work How ZK-rollups work The benefits and drawbacks of optimistic rollups and ZK-rollups A comparison of optimistic rollups vs ZK-rollups Applications of optimistic and ZK-rollups Subscribe Join us in showcasing the cryptocurrency revolution/ one newsletter at a time. Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox/ along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right/ millions love us!) — what are you waiting for? What Are Rollups? Rollups are layer-two scaling solutions that move transactions off-chain and maintain the mainnet's security and decentralization. The name rollup comes from the fact that transactions are grouped together into batches (or rolls) and then posted on Ethereum's mainchain for finality. The main benefit of rollups is that they can significantly reduce gas fees and increase transaction speed while preserving smart contract compatibility and composability. This means that users and developers can enjoy a better user experience and more innovation on Ethereum without compromising its core values. The main challenge of rollups is that different rollups require different ways of verifying transactions off-chain and handling disputes on-chain. Not all rollups are created equal. The two main types are optimistic rollups and ZK-rollups. They differ in their transaction verification and dispute handling and come with different benefits and drawbacks. What Are Optimistic Rollups? Optimistic rollups derive their name from an optimistic assumption: transactions are valid by default unless proven otherwise. The three main components of optimistic rollups are the smart contract/ the sequencer/ and the validators. The smart contract acts as the bridge between the Ethereum mainnet and the second layer. It receives transaction data from the sequencer as calldata/ which is stored for future verification on the blockchain. Transactions are executed off-chain by a centralized entity called a sequencer. The sequencer publishes the data on Ethereum's main chain as calldata. The transactions don't require any proof of validity or correctness. A promise that they will be available for verification if needed is enough. The validator network monitors the sequencer's activity and checks if any transaction violates the rules of Ethereum. This verification process can uncover invalid transactions/ which can be challenged by submitting a fraud proof on-chain to challenge it. It contains evidence showing how and why the transaction is invalid. If the challenge is successful/ the invalid transaction is reverted/ and the sequencer is penalized. What Are ZK-Rollups? ZK-Rollups rely on a cryptographic technique called zero-knowledge proofs: transactions are valid by default if proven to be so. They are executed off-chain by a network of nodes generating transaction data and proofs of validity. These are then submitted to the Ethereum mainnet as calldata. ZK-rollups have three main components: transactions/ state commitments/ and zero-knowledge validity proofs. Users sign transactions/ which sends them to layer-two producing blocks and batches. State commitments are snapshots of the current state of the second-layer blockchain. They are hashed and stored on the mainnet as calldata. Zero-knowledge validity proofs are cryptographic proofs guaranteeing the transactions in a batch are valid and follow Ethereum’s rules and do not mess with the state of the blockchain. Users sign transactions and send them to the operator. The operator executes transactions on the L2 according to Ethereum’s rules and updates the state accordingly. It then generates a state commitment for each block and a zero-knowledge proof for each batch of blocks. The data is submitted to Ethereum as calldata and its validity can be verified by anyone using the proofs and state commitments without running any computation or state transition. Advantages And Disadvantages of Optimistic Rollups The main advantage of optimistic rollups is the high potential throughput and low latency. Transactions are executed almost instantly off-chain and don't have to wait for on-chain confirmation. They also preserve smart contract compatibility and composability with Ethereum since they use the same virtual machine (EVM) and state transition rules. The main disadvantage of optimistic rollups is the long withdrawal period/ which is required for users to exit the system safely. Users need to wait for a sufficient amount of time to ensure that no fraud proofs are submitted against their transactions. Otherwise/ their funds could be at risk if an invalid transaction affects their balance. This waiting period can be more than one week but can be circumvented by using specialized bridges/ which allow faster withdrawals. Advantages and Disadvantages of ZK-Rollups The main advantage of ZK-rollups is also high potential throughput and low latency. Just like with optimistic rollups/ transactions are executed off-chain and ultimately secured by the L1. The main disadvantage of ZK-rollups is the complex cryptography and engineering structure of the rollups themselves. Consequently/ they are more expensive and harder to implement than optimistic rollups. They also may not support all types of smart contracts or functionalities that Ethereum offers. Optimistic Rollups vs ZK-Rollups Here is a quick overview table comparing optimistic and ZK-rollups according to different attributes: Optimistic vs ZK-rollups: Scalability and Costs One of the main goals of rollup solutions is to increase the throughput of transactions on Ethereum and reduce the gas fees for users. Optimistic rollups and ZK-rollups achieve this goal by batching transactions and periodically submitting them to the mainnet. However/ they have different trade-offs in terms of scalability and costs. Optimistic rollups can handle more transactions per second than ZK-rollups. On the other hand/ they require more gas to submit their batches to the main chain. Zk-rollups can save more gas than optimistic rollups/ but they also have higher computational costs to generate their zero-knowledge proofs. Additionally/ optimistic rollups have lower entry barriers for developers and users than ZK-rollups. They support any Ethereum smart contract without modification and do not require special hardware or software. ZK-rollups/ on the other hand/ require developers to rewrite their smart contracts in a specific language and users to install a compatible wallet or browser extension. Optimistic vs ZK-rollups: Security Another important factor to consider when comparing rollup solutions is their security and how they protect users’ funds and data from malicious actors. Optimistic rollups and ZK-rollups have different security risks and assumptions. Optimistic rollups are vulnerable to censorship attacks/ where a malicious sequencer or validator can delay or prevent valid transactions from being submitted to the main chain. They also rely on users and validators to monitor the side chain and challenge any fraudulent transactions within a certain time window. If no one challenges a fraudulent transaction/ it can be finalized on the main chain and cause users to lose their funds. ZK-rollups are immune to censorship attacks/ as they do not require anyone to submit or verify transactions on the side chain. They also do not rely on users or validators to challenge fraudulent transactions thanks to the ZK-proofs guaranteeing their validity before they are accepted by the main chain. However/ ZK-rollups have a trusted setup assumption/ where a group of participants must generate and destroy some secret parameters used to create the zero-knowledge proofs. If these parameters are compromised or leaked/ they can be used to create fake proofs and steal users’ funds. Optimistic vs ZK-rollups: Latency Latency refers to the time it takes for a transaction to be confirmed and finalized on the main chain. Optimistic rollups and ZK-rollups have different latency characteristics depending on their verification methods. Optimistic rollups have low latency for users/ as they can receive instant confirmation from the L2 without waiting for the main chain. However/ they also have high latency for finality/ as they have to wait for a challenge period to expire before their transactions are finalized on the main chain. This challenge period can vary from minutes to hours depending on the network congestion and security parameters. ZK-rollups have high latency for users/ as they have to wait for the zero-knowledge proofs to be generated and verified by the side chain before receiving confirmation. However/ they also have low latency for finality/ as they do not have a challenge period and their transactions are finalized on the main chain as soon as they are submitted. This can take from seconds to minutes depending on the block time and gas price. Optimistic vs ZK-rollups: Privacy Privacy refers to the ability of users to conceal their identities and transaction details from third parties. The different verification methods of optimistic rollups and ZK-rollups mean they have different privacy features. Optimistic rollups have low privacy for users/ as they have to reveal their transactions and signatures on the side chain and the main chain. Anyone can observe and analyze these transactions and link them to users’ addresses and identities. ZK-rollups have high privacy for users/ as they use zero-knowledge proofs to hide their transactions and signatures on the side chain and the main chain. Only the sender and receiver of a transaction can know its details and no one can link it to users’ addresses or identities. However/ ZK-rollups also have some privacy limitations/ such as requiring users to register their public keys on the sidechain before sending or receiving transactions. This can expose some information about users’ activity patterns and balances. Optimistic vs ZK-rollups: Validity Proof Validity proofs prove that a batch of transactions on the L2 is correct and consistent with the L1. Optimistic rollups use fraud proofs as their validity proof. They assume the transactions are correct by default and only verify them if someone challenges them. This not only allows them to publish blocks frequently and cheaply but also introduces a risk of invalid transactions being accepted if no one challenges them. ZK-rollups use zero-knowledge proofs as their validity proof. They do not assume anything about the transactions and verify them using cryptographic evidence. Every transaction is valid and final/ however/ this approach requires more computation and time to generate the proofs. Both validity-proof types have advantages and disadvantages in terms of scalability and security. The choice between them depends on the specific requirements and trade-offs of each application. Fraud proofs are faster and more flexible/ but also more vulnerable to attacks or errors. Zero-knowledge proofs are more secure and efficient/ but also more complex and limited. Optimistic vs ZK-rollups: Readiness for DeFi Optimistic and ZK-rollups differ in how well they adapt to the functionality required for DeFi. Optimistic rollups have a similar execution model to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)/ allowing them to run most of the existing smart contracts and protocols with minimal changes. Moreover/ several projects already use optimistic rollups. The Optimism ecosystem is home to Uniswap/ Synthetix/ Sushiswap and many other DeFi protocols. ZK-rollups are less compatible with the EVM/ limiting their functionality and expressiveness. They also have fewer projects using them/ although some are emerging/ such as ZigZag Exchange/ Loopring and zkSync. Both solutions are growing in their support for DeFi applications. Optimistic rollups are focusing on improving their security and efficiency/ while ZK-rollups work on enhancing their EVM compatibility and usability. In the long run/ both of them will likely be popular in the DeFi space. Optimistic vs ZK-rollups: Programming Easiness Programming easiness is a measure of how simple and convenient it is to develop and deploy applications on a scaling solution. Optimistic and ZK-rollups differ in how simple and convenient it is to develop and deploy applications for their respective ecosystems. Optimistic rollups are fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)/ meaning developers can use the same languages/ frameworks/ and tools they use on Ethereum. Thanks to fraud proofs/ no special knowledge or skills are needed to program on them. ZK-rollups are not fully compatible with the EVM/ so developers have to adapt their code and use different languages/ frameworks/ and tools specific to ZK-rollups. That requires more advanced knowledge and skills.
