    "title": "Ether ETFs Filing Process Sees Abrupt Progress, Though Approval Not Guaranteed: Sources",
    "detailedContent": "The exchanges that want to list and trade shares of spot ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds are abruptly being asked by regulators to update key filings related to these products. Exchanges are being asked to update 19b-4 filings on an accelerated basis by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, three people familiar with the situation told CoinDesk, suggesting they may be moving to approve these applications ahead of a key deadline this Thursday. That doesn\u0027t mean the ETFs will be authorized, though. Would-be issuers also need their S-1 applications approved before the products could begin trading. SEC could take an indefinite amount of time to approve the S-1 documents, one person familiar with the matter said, as it isn\u0027t tied to a deadline. One company in talks with the SEC said it feels like it might be on the right track for approval, in a turnaround from feeling some weeks ago that the SEC was dragging its feet, according to a person familiar with the matter. Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart raised their odds for the approval of a spot ether ETF to 75% from 25% on Monday after hearing chatter that the SEC could be taking a more favorable stance towards the applications. They later corrected their statement, saying that the odds were related to the 19b-4 approvals. The SEC is expected to make a decision on VanEck spot ether ETF on May 23rd. The SEC has been investigating whether ether, the chief native asset to the Ethereum blockchain, is a security, launching a formal inquiry after the network moved from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake mechanism. If ether is deemed to be a security by the SEC, that may be one reason for the regulator to reject the spot ether ETF applications. One test of the agency\u0027s view on whether ETH is a security has newly emerged at Prometheum. The special purpose broker announced Monday it had soft-launched its ether custody service. The company eventually intends to launch custody and trading services for other digital assets – importantly, assets that are treated as securities in the U.S., not commodities.

    "detailedContent": "A Monday rally during the U.S. trading day put an end to what had been very muted crypto price action over the previous 72 hours, pushing bitcoin (BTC) above $68,000 for the first time in more than five weeks. At press time, the world\u0027s largest crypto was changing hands at $68,250. Leading the rally in crypto was Solana\u0027s (SOL), which has gained 7% over the past 24 hours, also to more than a five-week high. That outperformed both bitcoin\u0027s 2.6% advance and the CoinDesk 20\u0027s 2.8% rise. Read more: Solana\u0027s SOL Could Hit $200 By Month End, Hedge Fund Founder Says The turnaround in the recent downward price action came last week after the government reported softer-than-forecast April inflation data and quarterly institutional filings showed interesting participation in the spot bitcoin ETFs from the Wisconsin state pension board and a number of heavy-hitting hedge funds. Bitcoin rallied from just above the $60,000 to more than $66,000 by week\u0027s end. Alongside that rally came a renewal of big inflows into the spot bitcoin ETFs, which had previously witnessed net outflows over four of the previous seven weeks. All told, the spot funds added 14,389 bitcoin last week, according to HODL Capital, the strongest performance since March. Earlier Friday, Grayscale, the manager of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), announced the exit of CEO Michael Sonnenshein, who will be replaced by Goldman Sachs executive Peter Mintzberg. The move suggests Grayscale may have its eyes on a return to growing assets for GBTC as opposed to the current slow bleed of bitcoin from its holdings.",

    "title": "Phemex Promises Market-Beating Borrowing Rates With Its New Lending Protocol, Elevates Engagement to New Heights With Pulse Season 3",
    "detailedContent": "Phemex, a top-tier cryptocurrency exchange, continues its streak of CeFi and DeFi innovations. Transitioning from a purely centralized platform, Phemex embraced decentralization last year and has evolved into a hybrid exchange, merging the best features of CEXes and DEXes. The latest fruit of this evolution is the Phemex Lending Protocol, which allows users to borrow cryptocurrency against their digital assets with favorable rates and ultimate flexibility, signaling Phemex\u0027s commitment to innovative, user-empowering solutions. While crypto enthusiasts have long expected that feature from their exchanges, Phemex revealed earlier this week some new advantages that can’t be found anywhere else. If you think about it, there are three main reasons why you might want to use any crypto exchange’s lending services: By each of these measures, the Phemex Lending Protocol meets or exceeds industry standards. Participants can take out loans denominated in USDT, BTC or ETH without the need to sell their crypto assets. Loans can also be taken out in PT, Phemex’s high-potential native coin. Because all loans are securely collateralized by participants’ assets, Phemex can provide flexibility to choose loan terms with variable interest rates. Whatever the time horizon on the loan, crypto exchanges can generally offer better rates than brick-and-mortar banks, according to Forbes Advisor. Even so, the Phemex team is confident that their loans compare favorably even among crypto exchanges. Phemex highlights its competitive edge with an annual USDT borrowing interest rate starting at 3.57%, a figure notably lower than the double-digit rates prevalent on competing platforms – not to mention almost two percentage points lower than money-center banks lend to each other overnight. For holders of vePT – the wrapped PT version that will soon confer voting authority in Phemex’s governing DAO – the deal gets even sweeter with an additional 30% discount on borrowing rates. Of course, Phemex community members can withdraw and reallocate funds as they see fit, unfettered by undue limitations or delays. This means that Phemex traders can enjoy more lucrative capital efficiency than they can on other exchanges, aligning with the cryptosphere’s goal of unlocking the potential of money. At Token2049 in Dubai last week, Phemex made a significant splash by hosting an elite gathering of major crypto community players and key opinion leaders. The extensive two-day networking event featured an insightful keynote by Phemex CEO Federico Variola. Another highlight of Token2049 was the introduction of the Phemex Lending Protocol, when Phemex COO Stella Chan showcased its competitive borrowing rates and the opportunity for users to supply assets in return for substantial earnings. In the future, the platform is expected to add uncollateralized loan capabilities which would propel its services beyond that of most DeFi lending protocols. “Phemex Lending Protocol is changing the game with low borrowing rates and a clear loan-to-value ratio, without any hidden fees,\" Chan announced. \"With $22 million in liquidity to start, users can now secure loans leveraging their holdings at just 3.57% APY – far below the high rates of other platforms. Our protocol ensures that users keep control, allowing them to freely withdraw and manage their funds. Additionally, by contributing to our lending pools, they can earn competitive APY returns, creating a robust passive income stream. It\u0027s a complete solution for favorable borrowing and earning.” By integrating these lending features, Phemex is not only expanding its services but also reinforcing its commitment to fostering a more inclusive and accessible financial environment for all its users. Certainly, Phemex has a grander vision than just providing lower interest rates on collateralized loans. The team there has been all about innovation. All this leads into its Web3 ecosystem, Phemexia, aiming to provide users with greater autonomy and cultivate a robust community where trust and permissionless collaboration are paramount. “Phemex is at the forefront as the crypto world evolves far beyond just digital cash, spearheading the charge into a digital ecosystem integral to our online lives,\" Chan says. \"Our users want democratized financial tools with uncompromising security, and we\u0027re delivering just that. We\u0027re pioneering in the Web3 space, answering the call with innovations like our new hybrid stack. It combines on-chain autonomy with reliable centralized performance, showcased by our latest offering – the Phemex Lending Protocol. Soon, users will be able to enhance our exchange\u0027s liquidity and earn rewards using our AMM protocol. We\u0027re eager to drive more innovation and sustain our collaborations with visionary partners in upcoming integrations and listings.” While Phemex’s PT token may be the most successful exchange-native coin this year, Phemex also generated a lot of buzz with the launch of its new SocialFi product Pulse. The platform elevates community groups within the social media realm by offering a decentralized hub, similar to a mix of Telegram\u0027s groups and Twitter\u0027s connectivity, but within the realm of Web3. Pulse sets itself apart with a unique reward system where community interaction directly earns users PT, a feature unmatched by any other social network. Phemex is now gearing up for the launch of Pulse Season 3, responding to community feedback by enhancing the platform with features that incentivize superior content. With the introduction of “Cast” for sharing insightful content and “Tip” as a way to appreciate high-quality engagement, users can now earn tips for their casts, increasing their chances of winning a portion of the daily 10,000 PT prize pool and ensuring that outstanding content is rewarded. Ultimately, the team’s goal is to expand Web3 use cases into the broader world. The more people get comfortable with blockchain technology and functions, the more widely digital assets will gain acceptance – and the faster these assets will appreciate in value. “Our mission is rooted in providing a user-centric ecosystem that offers the best trading experiences alongside a vibrant community. As we roll out our hybrid stack with the Phemex Lending launch, we\u0027re simultaneously fine-tuning Pulse based on user insights,” Chan says. “Community-driven development is pivotal to Pulse\u0027s growth, and with Season 3 on the horizon, we aim to reward the creation and engagement of premium content. We are dedicated to nurturing a community where meaningful interaction is recognized and rewarded.”",

Sonnenshein, who became CEO in 2021, will be replaced by Peter Mintzberg, head of strategy for asset and wealth management at Goldman Sachs on Aug. 15, Grayscale said on Monday. Mintzberg has more than 20 years of experience in TradFi, having previously worked at BlackRock, OppenheimerFunds and Invesco. CFO Edward McGee will lead the company on an interim basis until Mintzberg fills the role. \"Michael guided the firm through exponential growth \u0026 oversaw its pivotal role in bringing spot bitcoin ETFs to market, leading the way for the broader financial industry,\" Barry Silbert, CEO of Grayscale\u0027s parent company Digital Currency Group, wrote on X. In January, Grayscale was one of about a dozen firms to finally have a spot bitcoin ETF approved to list in the U.S. in January. The firm had taken the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to court over the regulator\u0027s repeated refusal to allow it to convert its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), then a closed-end fund, into an ETF. GBTC saw around $15 billion of outflows in the following three months as the firm kept fees higher than its competitors.

    "detailedContent": "Craig Wright lied \"extensively and repeatedly\" in both his written and oral evidence in the Crypto Open Patent Alliance case regarding his claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto, Judge James Mellor said in his written judgement on Monday. Mellor also concluded that the issue of injunctive relief - a legal remedy to stop a defendant from doing something - will be argued at a Form of Order hearing that will be appointed after the judgment has been handed down. Mellor in March concluded Wright was not Nakamoto, the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, and that he had not authored the cryptocurrency\u0027s foundational document known as the white paper. \"I want to thank those of you who sent me messages of support yesterday. I await the written judgment at which point I will consider my options for appeal,” Wright said on X (formally known as Twitter) in March. Although the ruling can be appealed, Mellor’s definitive statement following the month-long trial was cause for celebration for the broader crypto industry, which has long criticized and been victim to Wright’s legal battles against members of the community. “Dr. Wright is not the person who adopted or operated under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto in the period 2008 to 2011. Third, Dr. Wright is not the person who created the Bitcoin System. And, fourth, he is not the author of the initial versions of the Bitcoin software,” Mellor said after both parties to the trial had presented their evidence. The Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA), whose stated mission is to protect the adoption of crypto and fight threats against the new technology, filed to take Wright to court in 2021. The trial commenced on Feb. 5, with COPA accusing Wright of forgery and, later, perjury. \"I am entirely satisfied that Dr Wright lied to the Court extensively and repeatedly,\" Mellor said. \"Most of his lies related to the documents he had forged which purported to support his claim.\" COPA, whose backers include Twitter founder Jack Dorsey and crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN), said it will seek several injunctions to prevent Wright from claiming to be Nakamoto and taking Bitcoin developers to court again. It has also said it may ask U.K. prosecutors to consider perjury charges against Wright for statements made during the trial. \"Dr Wright’s attempts to prove he was/is Satoshi Nakamoto represent a most serious abuse of this Court’s process,\" Mellor said in his judgment. \"The same point applies to other jurisdictions as well: Norway in particular.\" Wright also had a nearly five year long legal battle against Norwegian bitcoiner Hodlonaut. In March, Mellor imposed a worldwide freezing order on 6 million British pounds ($7.6 million) worth of Wright assets to ensure he couldn\u0027t move them offshore or evade costs from the COPA trial. According to the order, COPA\u0027s costs for the case amounted to 6.7 million pounds at the time.

    "title": "Will RFK Jr. Debate Trump or Biden? Probably Not, Prediction Market Says",
    "detailedContent": "This week in prediction markets… A presidential debate that includes independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. alongside President Biden or Republican frontrunner Donald Trump is unlikely to happen, bettors on crypto-based predictions platform Polymarket are signaling. \"Yes\" shares in the contract are trading at 27 cents, meaning the market sees a 27% chance of it occurring. Each share pays out $1 if the prediction comes true, and zero if not. The machinations of the American political-industrial complex make it difficult for a third party, or independent candidate, to succeed. Ballot access laws favor major parties, creating significant barriers for third-party candidates. Getting on a debate stage has another high threshold of its own. Rules for the first debate, scheduled for June 27 on CNN, say that the candidates must appear on enough state ballots to hypothetically reach 270 electoral votes, and also receive 15% in four polls. A second debate on ABC is scheduled for September, and it also has a 15% polling rule. Currently, RFK Jr. is polling at just under 10% in national polls compiled by 270toWin. Right now his team says they have confirmed ballot access, or are working on it, in enough states to win 201 electoral votes, which is enough to be a spoiler, but not to win the presidency. But independent candidates have participated in the debates in living memory: in 1992, independent candidate H. Ross Perot appeared on stage alongside George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton. To be clear, the Polymarket contract says that RFK Jr. must participate in a debate including Trump or Biden. It doesn\u0027t say that the debate must be an official one. Trump\u0027s campaign wants more debates, according to reports, proposing one per month from June to September, preferring two-hour stand-up debates in larger venues with live audiences. The current train of thought holds that RFK Jr.\u0027s campaign is more of a threat to Biden than Trump\u0027s, and polls that include him give Trump a slight edge, up to 5 points in some. It\u0027s plausible that the Trump campaign could decide to host a streaming debate with the Kennedy campaign, or hold it on a lesser-known network like OANN. It just needs to be a \"publicly broadcast debate\" per Polymarket\u0027s rules. (Don\u0027t forget that Kennedy is coming to CoinDesk\u0027s Consensus conference, taking the stage on May 31 at 4:30 PM) Sora, OpenAI\u0027s text-to-video generator, wowed the world when Sam Altman\u0027s company demoed the project back in February. Missing is a launch date. Bettors on Kalshi, a U.S.-regulated platform, are predicting that launch will take place sometime between September and the end of 2025, with only a 27% chance it will occur before September. But there\u0027s one thing that\u0027s getting in the way of a wide release of Sora: the availability of high-end graphics processing units (GPUs). Rendering video from text prompts is going to take a lot of them, more, in fact, than many of the world\u0027s largest customers of Nvidia have in their data centers. According to a report by Factorial Funds, OpenAI\u0027s Sora faces significant challenges regarding GPU availability, as mainstream adoption of text-to-video generation would require hundreds of thousands of server-grade GPUs at a cost of tens of billions. Factorial estimates that supporting the creator community of platforms like TikTok and YouTube alone would necessitate around 720,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs, far exceeding the combined resources of major tech companies like Microsoft, Meta, and Google. But remember, the contract isn\u0027t asking if Sora will be widely available. A launch with limited availability and a high monthly cost would still count. It\u0027s just asking if it will launch. Punters on Polymarket aren’t expecting any of the best-known cat meme coins to become the first such token to reach the $1 billion market cap milestone. A market capitalization bet for cat-themed tokens, which some expect to flip their dog-themed counterparts in the next bull cycle, has racked up $1.2 million in bets since going live in March. As of Monday, popular tokens Popcat (POPCAT) and cat in a dogs world (MEW) have 22% and 7% odds, while shark cat (SC) and toshi (TOSHI) have odds of under 2%. Despite all these memes being valued at over $200 million and occupying massive mindshare in the meme coin community, punters aren’t expecting any of these to become the first billion-dollar cat meme. Instead, the “others/none in 2024” category dominates the odds at 68%. Other cat-themed tokens in the open market but not referenced in the Polymarket contract are mog (MOG), wen (WEN) and maneki (MANEKI), according to CoinGecko. The high odds for two distinct outcomes suggest traders either expect a whole other cat meme to become the biggest or expect no single token in the category to get such a rich valuation. The apparent bearish sentiment is likely not due to the lack of buying pressure, either. Two dog tokens, bonk (BONK), dogwifhat (WIF), and the frog-themed pepe (PEPE), were launched in 2023 and zoomed to over $3 billion each in less than a year, showcasing the demand for such tokens. Among meme coin hunters, the perceived cuteness of a meme drives its virality and, ultimately, price. So which is cuter: a dog with a pink beanie hat or a cat with a mouth that pops? The punters have decided. A market betting on Solana fees flipping those of Ethereum has fallen 12 points in the past week, after jumping up to 35% earlier in the month. The “Solana flips ETH in daily fees in May?” market, which has seen over $60,000 in wagers placed, is a market on whether the daily fees of Solana (SOL) will surpass that of Ethereum (ETH) for any day within this market’s time frame from May 10 to May 31. Odds of the flip rose earlier this month due to a revival of meme coin trading as GameStop stock prices surged higher, aiding growth in meme tokens. However, the odds fell following a $2 million exploit on Pump.Fun, a tool that lets anyone deploy a tradeable token on Solana. The brief exploit may have been expected by some to slow the rapid issuance of meme coins on Solana, which would in turn depress daily fees. Despite being extremely cheap compared to Ethereum, the Solana blockchain collects millions of dollars in fees every day thanks to the sheer magnitude of meme coin trading activity on the network. Still, the fee difference isn’t a big one. Blockchain activity on Ethereum netted it over $1.84 million in the past 24 hours, while it was nearly $1.2 million for Solana, DefiLlama data shows. Pump.Fun has since come back online, and is seeing thousands of new memes launched daily as usual. Peruse it at your risk.",

These are just a handful of the cutting-edge blockchain tech topics on the agenda at CoinDesk\u0027s Consensus 2024 conference, which runs Wednesday, May 29, through Friday, May 31, in Austin, Texas. For blockchain developers, it\u0027s red meat. For others, it may sound unfamiliar. For everyone, including those somewhere in between, the three days are packed with opportunities to learn about the hottest crypto tech on Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Cosmos and XRP Ledger – from the world\u0027s top experts. We took a spin through the agenda to identify stages and sessions likely to interest blockchain developers and people interested in the technology. In general there are six broad categories of relevant programming: The overall Consensus agenda is pretty sprawling. In terms of the blockchain tech highlights, the following would represent our picks.

    "title": "Crypto Old-Head Otoh Talks Casascius Bitcoins, Tax Havens and Old Friends",
    "detailedContent": "It’s quite likely that Otoh has lost more bitcoin than most people will ever hold. An early bitcoin investor, Otoh, a pseudonym that stands for “on the other hand,” has many lessons to share about finding opportunities and making one’s own luck. Otoh is a speaker at this year’s Consensus festival, in Austin, Texas, May 29-31. Scheduled to speak on stage at Consensus 2024, in Austin, Texas, alongside crypto luminaries like Litecoin creator Charlie Lee and BTCC and Ballet founder Bobby Lee, Otoh is known among the early crypto crowd for his massive holdings of physical bitcoins – a.k.a. Casascius coins. “I\u0027ve never sold any. I’ve just been accumulating them as my version of a cold storage,” Otoh told CoinDesk in an interview, discussing his recent auction of over 200 worth of physical bitcoins in what was the Heritage auction firm’s first crypto sale. Casascius coins, created by Mike Caldwell (who went by Casascius, an acronym for “call a spade a spade,” on Bitcoin forums), were a solution to spending bitcoin in face-to-face transactions by embedding a Bitcoin private key in a metal coin. The last ones were made in 2013 after the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network told Caldwell that he was operating an unlicensed money transmitter business. There are only about 90,000 Casascius coins in circulation, of varying denominations, though other manufacturers including Bobby Lee created their own versions. A part of Bitcoin lore and its physical history, Casascius coins are now sought after by collectors (some are so valuable that they have to be declared to U.S. Customs when entering the country). In some sense, these coins are the most long lived and recognizable image of the purely a digital currency. “It seemed the right time to let some of the physical coins go,” Otoh said. “Let other people look after them and enjoy having them.” Of course, part of the danger of bringing bitcoin into the physical realm is that it makes the assets as easy to steal as a $20 note from mom’s purse – and unfortunately, Otoh thinks he was the victim of a theft about a decade ago. He recounted a story of receiving a shipment of coins where the box had been obviously tampered with. The 55 BTC missing from his collection were worth about $20,000 at the time they were purchased, and are now worth about $3.5 million, “which is a huge sum in most anyone\u0027s book,” he said. “I\u0027m very happy to offer a half a million dollar reward for their return. And unconditionally, I wouldn\u0027t want to press charges if someone decided to give them back to me,” he added. See also: Why, for Some, Crypto Is the Defining Political Issue of Our Times | Opinion CoinDesk caught up with Otoh ahead of Consensus to discuss his recent auction of vintage physical bitcoins, early investments in other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum’s initial coin offering and how he manages his wealth by diversifying into properties around the world and residing in a tax haven in the British Channel Islands. Could you give a sense of what you’re talking about at Consensus? I’m on the panel about physical bitcoins. I\u0027m basically a fill-in for Mike Caldwell, who invented Casascius coins, who couldn\u0027t make it unfortunately. Oh, that\u0027s so cool. Would be nice to meet him one day. Bobby Lee and Charlie Lee asked if I\u0027d be a substitute for the gap on the panel because I am a large investor. Do you remember buying your first coin? Yes, very much. It was at the London Bitcoin Conference in 2012. I had just started on bitcoin in the summer of 2011, around July. I remember at the time I met with some German guys – there were all these privacy advocates wearing masks who had a whole bunch of physical coins to sell. I believe it was 10 regular bitcoins and a 10 bitcoin unit piece. The price at the time, with the premium and everything, was $12 a bitcoin. What does Otoh stand for? It’s an acronym for “on the other hand.” That\u0027s how it\u0027s usually used. I just adopted it because I find myself, a lot of the time, not necessarily being argumentative but looking at different viewpoints. I thought bitcoin and crypto is also a different way of looking at finance. Nearly everyone had a nickname on the BitcoinTalk forum. That\u0027s the way that came about, but I didn\u0027t give it much thought at the time. It was just the first thing that came into my head. Are there any particular memories of the early days of Bitcoin that you remember fondly? Fondly? Yes, that must be getting my first coin – that was a big deal. At the time people were still giving away free coins. By the time I joined, word had spread, and it often wasn\u0027t a full coin anymore, just a fraction of a coin, but it was still fun to have my own address and then be sent this little token amount of coins to see how it could function. At the time I was traveling between Europe and the States quite a bit and also buying and selling in Europe and the States. With bitcoin, it suddenly became really easy to send money. A few of the other memories are more traumatic. It\u0027s very easy to mess up. As you learn as you go. You\u0027ve probably lost more bitcoins than most people have today. If you count the ones that were stolen off me. Like that list I just gave you that I put together from nine years ago. Somewhere out there there is a lost, stolen treasure of a few million dollars. What do you suspect happened there? A rogue employee? I think it is most likely a rogue U.S. Postal Service employee who just used a box cutter and saw something that looked promising. He probably thought it was Gold Eagles or Silver Eagles or something. I don\u0027t know what the reaction would be, whether they were disgusted to see it was just some weird tokens and threw them away or whether they thought “Oh, this looks cool.” I’ve always hoped that I’d have a brainstorm and remember if I’ve stashed them away somewhere. But it doesn\u0027t make any sense – I\u0027ve got everything else very well looked after and itemized. A friend of mine whose house I had been staying in at that time remembers receiving a box that was cut open and resealed. Is there anything that you want to say about the OTOH Collection of Physical Cryptocurrency? Well, after a decade, I decided it\u0027s time to sell. I\u0027ve never sold any, I’ve just been accumulating them as my version of a cold storage. Now that I\u0027ve sold all my digital crypto, it seemed the right time to let some of the physical coins go. Let other people look after them and enjoy having them. You\u0027re also a real estate investor. At this point, do you think it’s better for people to invest in bitcoin or physical property? I think it’s a mixture of the two. Bitcoin is high-risk, but potentially it has very high returns. And property is a hedge. It\u0027s a safety net. It\u0027s also very hard to steal, whereas bitcoins can be very easy to steal. If I was still in my 20s, then I\u0027d probably be keeping a much higher percentage in crypto, but nowadays I like the security of having a bunch of properties and enjoy renovating them. Are you interested in other digital assets? In the past I pretty much have been. I was the largest holder of litecoin (LTC) when it was a few cents. I think I had roughly 600,000. It was the first altcoin, and was quite controversial with Bitcoin Maximalists. They disliked it intensely because they thought it withdrew funds and interest away from Bitcoin. But I was quite convinced from the first time I saw it, it\u0027s impossible for anything to exist without its opposite. And so that paid out very well. After Litecoin, I moved into Dash and was the largest holder of those and helped develop the project in some ways. And then I kind of lost interest and moved onto other things. I was highly recommended Ethereum at a Dutch conference and participated in the ICO. I got 100 bitcoins worth, which was 210,000 ether (ETH). Unfortunately, I sold those way too soon. I made 100% or 200% profit, but I sold them for something like $2. So I will rue the potential $800 million there. Otherwise I\u0027m pretty much fully bitcoin nowadays. The way you discussed bitcoin earlier in the conversation you discussed it mostly as a method of transaction. Are you convinced by the arguments that it has properties like gold? I think it is excellent as an investment. I think that\u0027s its main use at the moment. It’s perhaps the best performing investment in history, and it continues to grow. It is a trillion dollar asset class, and a great way to store value. Satoshi viewed it in the beginning as a hedge against the degenerate behavior of central governments and banks abusing the currencies that we will have to use every day. It\u0027s much more versatile than gold, in that it can be transferred pretty much anywhere around the world from anyone to anyone, instantly, with no armored trucks or anything and next to no fees. It\u0027s quite miraculous really, that it\u0027s come into existence. It\u0027s still very early days, but it really has transformed the world in many many ways. What have been your biggest purchases made with crypto? I must admit I\u0027ve done very little with buying and selling with crypto. I go from fiat currency into crypto and then back out to fiat currency. Capital gains taxes make spending crypto sort of annoying, to some extent. For many people it would, yes. I\u0027m fortunate that I am based in a tax haven where there isn\u0027t any capital gains tax. I make sure that I\u0027m physically there when I cash any out. So I don\u0027t have that issue. There\u0027s also no income tax. You mentioned you have a home in California. How do you balance the tax situation there, where state tax authorities may want to charge you income tax? I’ve got homes in many countries around the world; it doesn\u0027t mean I\u0027m suddenly a tax resident. I make sure I count my days very carefully – I don’t overstay. As long as I\u0027m not here for more than six months of the year, I won\u0027t be liable for any tax. And I don\u0027t do any business here. Do you mind if I ask what tax haven? It’s a little island in the British Channel Islands called Sark. It’s a three square mile island and fairly unique in the world for having next to no tax. You just pay a small proportion of your property tax as a contribution to the kind of upkeep of the island. The main thing about it that\u0027s attractive is you don\u0027t have to keep records of what you\u0027re doing, which would have been hugely complicated when I was converting altcoins into bitcoin and then into other alternative currencies and then back into dollars. I pity the people who had to try and keep these records and then present them to a tax authority – it must be a nightmare. Did you give up your passport? No, I still keep a U.K. passport. I could trade it in for a Guernsey passport, which is the main island in the channel. It\u0027s really just a clone of the U.K.. It has all the same benefits, but I haven\u0027t bothered to do it. It doesn\u0027t really matter what nationality I have. It really only matters where I\u0027m a fiscal resident. How would you describe your political views? Well, like many people, with age I probably have become a little more conservative in some ways. But I\u0027m pretty much a capitalist; I believe that\u0027s a good way for people to behave. I\u0027m not overtly political. I was probably quite anarchist in the past. I just adapt to whatever the majority believes. I am not trying to change things myself in a big way – I’m pretty apolitical. Is there anything more you want to say about the possible theft of those Casascius coins? I believe it was 55 bitcoins in value, something like $3.5 million at present value. At the time they were lost or taken they were only worth about $13,000. Still a lot but nothing compared to right now. So I\u0027m very happy to offer a half a million dollar reward for their return. And unconditionally, I wouldn\u0027t want to press charges if someone decided to give them back to me. See also: Spot Bitcoin ETFs: What You Need to Know One day, I expect they\u0027ll turn up unless they\u0027ve gone on a destructive route somehow. Everyone can see the addresses; I was really surprised when I checked a couple of weeks ago that they had never been moved and that they hadn\u0027t been peeled. So they\u0027re probably out there somewhere. Last question, what are you looking forward to at Consensus? Well, meeting Bobby Lee and Charlie Lee again. They both in their own ways have been very instrumental in helping me with my crypto journey. Charlie Lee by inventing Litecoin, where I did extremely well – probably even better than I did with bitcoin. And Bobby Lee for having BTCC (also known as BTCChina) and the physical coins. He produced physical coins just like Mike\u0027s Casascius coins. I have still got all my BTCC coins. That will be a future auction. I\u0027ve had quite a few adventures with the physical coins. I had to physically go to Shanghai to pick them up, as they couldn\u0027t be shipped at the time. That was an adventure in itself. There\u0027s other people that I know from forums and interacting with on the internet who I\u0027m sure it would be nice to see again in person if I\u0027ve met them at other conferences. It\u0027s a chance to put people together and exchange ideas that if one just sat behind a computer at home, perhaps wouldn\u0027t happen. So I\u0027m looking forward to it. It\u0027s quite exciting. It\u0027s my first visit to Texas.",

    "title": "\u0027What Are We Waiting for\u0027? SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce Discusses Moving Crypto Regulation Forward",
    "detailedContent": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is not a monolithic institution. Look no further than Hester Peirce (a.k.a. Crypto Mom), who is currently serving her second term as one of five overseeing commissioners. Over the past several years, Peirce has made a reputation as a defender of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology — writing innumerable dissenting opinions regarding the many legal actions the SEC has waged against crypto protocols and companies. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce will speak at Consensus 2024 this May. Grab your pass here. To some extent, Peirce’s disagreements with SEC Chair Gary Gensler stem from their varying philosophical and political beliefs. Peirce, a Republican and member of the Federalist Society, thinks the government should have a limited hand in regulating commerce. Whereas Gensler, who swims in Democratic circles, is often harder to pin down. While Gensler has seemingly evolving opinions on crypto (having appeared as a blockchain supporter while teaching the subject at MIT), Pierce has remained steadfast in her support of economic innovation. “It’s a fundamental American principle that people are free to make choices. The government is not there to protect people from their own choices,” Peirce told CoinDesk in an interview. This view colors Peirce’s opinions on whether the SEC should block spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs), go after U.S.-based exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken as well as what role agency should play in overseeing crypto markets. CoinDesk caught up with Commissioner Peirce ahead of Consensus 2024, where she’s scheduled to speak this May, to discuss the SEC’s enforcement actions, her distaste of Big Banks and where U.S. crypto regulation first went wrong. Hi mom. To start off with an easy one, would you be able to describe the fundamental split in opinion that you have with SEC Chair Gary Gensler? It\u0027s not an easy question. Just to start out, look, the views I represent and will reflect are my own views, not necessarily those of the SEC or my fellow commissioners, so I can\u0027t speak for anyone else at the commission. Are you talking about crypto specifically or about the universe of issues? I wanted to maybe widen the scope. What are your fundamental political or philosophical differences? So, in terms of philosophy — I have the view that I don\u0027t necessarily know what\u0027s best for other people. We have our statutory mandates that we have to implement. But within those mandates, we\u0027re often given discretion. And if we have discretion, my preference is to say, well, let\u0027s let market participants make a decision about what they want to do. Now, sometimes there\u0027s a reason that we have to step into the middle of a transaction, and say “No, you can\u0027t do that” or “Yes, you can do it, but you have to do it in this particular way.” But we better have a really good reason for stepping into the middle of that transaction. See also: SEC in \u0027Enforcement-Only Mode\u0027 for Crypto, Commissioner Peirce Says It’s a fundamental American principle that people are free to make choices. The government is not there to protect people from their own choices. It\u0027s there to protect people if someone else harms them, but not to make their life decisions for them. In the past, you\u0027ve been critical of big banks but have also argued that the regulatory response to the Great Financial Crisis was offbase. I’m wondering if this somehow connects to your interest in crypto? I think my interest in crypto stems from a couple of things. First, I think it\u0027s a good test for how we handle innovation — or maybe a bad test in the sense that I think we\u0027re not passing it. Crypto came to us with a lot of new players and a lot of new ideas. I think we should have figured out how to work with these new players and figure out a way how they could do what they wanted to do in a way that would be compliant, but also allowed them to move forward. There is a connection in the sense that when I look at the financial crisis — a lot of people have looked at it and come to different conclusions about the causes — one of the things going on was poor regulatory design. A regulatory design that led to everyone making the same dumb mistake at the same time. One way to address that is to build resilience into the system, and having heterogeneity in the system is a good way to build resilience. There are some interesting concepts within crypto that allow for more decentralization of the financial system. So yes, in that sense, there\u0027s a connection. But do I think that the decentralized future is going to replace centralized intermediaries in the financial system? My prediction would be not; people want to deal with a centralized intermediary. But I think that there will be a role for decentralized finance. Maybe it\u0027s in the background. Maybe it’s more than that. I predict most people will access it through a centralized intermediary. I could be wrong. You don\u0027t have to answer this question, but do you hold cryptocurrencies? Because I work on these issues all the time. I do not, and would not even if I could. I feel like there\u0027d be a conflict. If you work on these issues, you can\u0027t have crypto, basically. I\u0027m speaking only for what the rules are that apply to me. A question from my editor: Prometheum; what\u0027s going on there? Is this an example of the SEC picking winners? I\u0027m not going to speak to any particular entity. Nice try. That\u0027s fair enough. Your Safe Harbor proposal is common sense, but in the intervening years since you\u0027ve published it, I think it\u0027s arguably become clear that maybe three years is too short of a time for protocols to decentralize. Solana, Cardano, even Ethereum to an extent have centralized entities directing development — the non-profit organizations founded alongside the network. Do you think we should be thinking about decentralization on a longer timeline? Decades? Again, decentralization is not an end in itself. It is the right thing in certain circumstances. However, sometimes having a centralized entity is the right thing. We should all take a step back and think about what we\u0027re trying to achieve. And fundamentally, what we need to achieve is the ability for people to know whether or not they\u0027re dealing with a security, so when they do something or sell something they understand whether it’s a securities offering. They need to know that in the primary and secondary markets. Then, if we decide that certain crypto assets are securities, or that it doesn\u0027t make sense to adjust the rules, there is a sensible framework that makes sense for crypto assets. Does it make sense to set up some sort of disclosure regime for centralized entities? That\u0027s really a congressional decision. But we can\u0027t even really have these conversations at the SEC right now because the conclusion is just to apply exactly the same rules that apply to stocks and be done with it — and I just don\u0027t think that works. But just taking a step back and thinking about what we\u0027re really trying to solve might take some pressure off the decentralization question. How closely do you or the other four commissioners work with the Enforcement Division. Do you suggest cases to litigate? So, just to give you a sense of how things work on the enforcement side. As with the rulemaking side, it\u0027s the staff that does the bulk of the work. They consider a rule and will propose it for us and we\u0027ll consider it. Often the vote happens at a public, open meeting. With enforcement actions, we also get recommendations. Typically, the staff will recommend authorizing an enforcement action and settling it at the same time. So we often don\u0027t see the case until the end, and are not involved in the guts of the matter. So we\u0027re either going to authorize the division to sue or authorize you to sue and settle with them on the same day. Most of our cases settle like that right away. The voting happens in a process called seriatim, where we\u0027re just voting on the papers, or we vote at a meeting where we have a discussion, but those meetings are, as you might guess, not open to the public. So in a way, if there was a change in the presidential administration in the upcoming election, then the current enforcement regime could continue, more or less, as is? I think these are great questions because the structure of the agency is a little strange. Strange in the sense that it\u0027s not like a lot of other agencies that have a single head. But while there are five of us commissioners, Chair Gensler does have the authority to set the rulemaking agenda and staff also report to him. The chair can certainly push the direction that things go, but you\u0027re right, it\u0027s not as if when a new chairman comes in all the existing enforcement investigations just stop. The agency is designed to keep going. Would you take the job if Trump or Tulsi were elected? That\u0027s not even on the radar. No? Yeah, I\u0027m focused on The Now, and trying to try to shift us to a better place. I\u0027ve been here for six years, and it\u0027s very discouraging to see that we have not taken a productive path at all. To me, it\u0027s inevitable that we\u0027ll have to take a productive path at some point — so why not start now? What are we waiting for? This isn\u0027t a question about the present, but I am curious in what ways the agency has changed since your first couple of stints during the early 2000s at the SEC? Over the years we\u0027ve gotten progressively more prescriptive in our rulemaking approach. An issue I raised in a speech last week is that we\u0027ve gotten less willing to engage on some of the difficult issues with the staff and the public. That has not been a positive set of changes. Is there any reason to believe or to hope that the spot market ETH ETF process won\u0027t unfold similarly to what happened with the spot market bitcoin ETFs? I can\u0027t talk about that one because we\u0027ve got some applications under consideration. Do you think the 2017 DAO Report set the crypto regulation off on the wrong foot? Yeah, I do. Because I think that the facts of the DAO Report are different from the facts of most crypto offerings that we see, right? The facts were unique. And I just don\u0027t think that the legal analysis that we\u0027ve applied to thinking about tokens has been helpful for really getting to the crux of the issue. See also: SEC Blasts \u0027Purportedly Decentralized\u0027 DAOs in $1.7M Barnbridge Settlement So if I could rewind — I wasn\u0027t here at the time of the DAO report, though I’ve learned a lot in that time — I would change the way we approach things. Do you agree with Judge Failla’s interpretation in the XRP case, that tokens aren\u0027t necessarily securities, but when you sell them to qualified investors it’s an investment contract? Well, again, because that\u0027s litigation, I don\u0027t want to talk about any particular judge\u0027s opinion. But as I have said, in other contexts, when you think about an investment contract, whether it\u0027s a digital asset or some other kind of a tangible asset, the asset itself is not the security on its own. It’s when you offer that asset along with an investment contract that’s what makes a security a security. It becomes the object at the center of the investment contract. But you still have to think about those two things as distinct. The orange groves in Howey were not on their own securities. Your dissenting opinions are often quite artful. Was it your idea or your co-author Mark Uyeda’s idea to include a play in the ShapeShift document? I can\u0027t answer that question either. Thanks again for your time. Well, I appreciate you taking the time and I hope you have a great afternoon.",

    "title": "Irthu Suresh: Using Blockchain Tech to Reduce Water Shortages",
    "detailedContent": "Much of the world takes water for granted. And much of the world has so little water that it’s a matter of life and death. So how can we send water from areas of surplus to areas of need? This is the mission of Atlantis, a project devoted to solving issues stemming from climate change, focusing primarily on water. And they’re trying to crack this problem by using blockchain. Irthu Suresh is a speaker at this year’s Consensus festival in Austin, Texas, May 29-31. Atlantis is not just theoretical. Across 50 villages in the region of Chikmagalur, India, Atlantis deployed a Web3 solution that incentivized people to effectively transfer water from the Haves to the Have Nots. A clever system of “bounties” encouraged villagers to perform tasks that enabled this new distribution. And the pilot program worked. “We’ve exchanged more than 21,000 kiloliters of water,” says Irthu Suresh, CEO of Atlantis. Giving a sneak preview of what he’ll share in Austin at Consensus, Suresh explains why Atlantis adopted blockchain, the challenges they had to overcome for onboarding, and why he wants the world to know that Web3 is not just for trading but that “we can use this to fight water problems, to fight poverty.” Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity. Atlantis didn’t start out as a blockchain organization, but eventually you incorporated the tech. What led you to this? Irthu Suresh: We were trying to build solutions for climate change — primarily through water — as a Web2 company, but a private entity trying to build for the commons was not really striking a chord. And we ran into all kinds of challenges with existing power structures, everything from regulations to unregulated mafia in India. It’s very easy to bring down an idea if it’s built by a private entity. All you need is a bunch of lawyers. And that led us to think, “How can me and my co-founder become insignificant over time as this system scales?\" And that led us to look at decentralized distributed systems. We figured that if this works, no one should be able to bring it down. Then we realized that there were people who were willing to harvest additional water and then supply it into the network. This was creating additional pools of surplus resources. And we were like, “What if we could build this entire system on blockchain?” So what does that look like exactly? In most parts of the world, things like water are heavily regulated. And you have these centralized grids. But as cities and spaces expand, often these centralized grids struggle to catch up. But India is a great example of being built, historically, on decentralized communities. You have small pockets of villages taking care of their needs. It\u0027s hyper-local. So for us, it was a no-brainer to bring some kind of concept that solves for resource allocation problems. There are some parts where water is abundant, and nobody cares about it. And there are other places where access to water is life and death. So for the pilot, when we partnered with Mercy Corps Ventures, we chose a specific location in India where on one side of this hill there’s an abundance of water, and on the other side of the hill there’s a drought. And how could people in this region exchange this excess water? How could we create the infrastructure locally itself? So for our pilot program in Chikmagalur — a rural region with 50 villages — we started with people in different water stress zone. Interesting. What did your system do? First we had people locally volunteer to spread awareness, then we had local people sign up to become water harvesters. Once we had these harvesters and there was a rain that was captured, there was an opportunity for it to be exchanged. How does blockchain fit into this? We built the product on a mobile native app. On this app, everybody could create a profile, sign up, and first mention what their skill is. And based on the skill, we start giving you tasks. And these tasks are pretty much to build up this peer-to-peer water network. You could take part in surveying, you could take part in water sample testing, you could sign up as someone who wants to spread awareness through workshops, or you could become a harvester. All of these tasks are gamified; we call them bounties. People sign up and then they do the required steps that are required, and then they get incentivized. We knew this first required a distributed ledger that is tamper-proof, and we knew that blockchain is useful for that. Amazing. Can you quantify the impact so far? Yeah. We’ve exchanged more than 21,000 kiloliters of water. The network has over 3,000 people and it\u0027s covering 50 villages. Out of the 3,000, predominantly most are consumers who are coming into the network to access water. But we have almost 150 harvesters in the network. And then we have a bunch of surveyors and validators. What’s a validator in this context? Let’s say you plug into the network and say, \"Hey, I\u0027m a harvester.\" Then we put out a bounty for someone in the locality to become a validator, who goes to your place and just validates that, \"Hey, these guys have the infrastructure for it.\" So what happens, in essence, is we’re creating a bunch of these local green jobs. And all of these different tasks are gamified using our bounty system. What problems did you run into? One was off-ramping. Especially in India, it\u0027s tough to off-ramp, because the regulations are still in a gray area. And then starting from the first MVP we designed, at the very onset of onboarding, whenever we asked people to connect to a wallet, that didn\u0027t work. Because people were like, \"What\u0027s a wallet?\" And I got an absolute schooling on UI and UX. We had to really figure out when is the right place to introduce blockchain or the Web3 terminologies. And we had to take extra steps to educate people about it. Because people are like, ”Oh, it\u0027s crypto. That means it\u0027s a scam.” And we’re like, “No, no, hold on!” Right? Like, there\u0027s so much more to it! What tokens are you using to drive the mechanics? We do have an internal token, which we\u0027ll someday launch. During the pilot we actively used it. But seeing how the Web3 market works, we are strong believers that unless we hit a strong product-market fit, launching a token doesn\u0027t make sense for us. So we’ve integrated a mechanism in which different tokens can be brought into the platform. If someone wants to fund a water project in Africa using Solana they can, whereas if somebody wants to do a water project in Vietnam using Optimism, they\u0027re able to do that. We really worked on the interoperability aspect of it because climate change does not care which chain you are on. Well said. Last question: What are you most looking forward to at Consensus? So, one of the biggest lifelines for our project has been Bitcoin. And I know that Consensus is a great place to go and meet people who have pioneered some of these technologies we are using today. I\u0027m hoping that we\u0027re able to come and talk about the things that we’ve been doing with blockchain, which is not necessarily just DeFi trading. We really want people to know that, “Hey, we can use this to fight water problems, to fight poverty.\" The idea of distributed ledgers is super powerful. More people need to know that there\u0027s actual examples of this being played out. Great sentiment. Congrats on what you’ve built and see you in Austin.",

    "title": "DeFi Gigabrain Tarun Chitra on ETH Staking, Restaking and Why ‘Financial Nihilism\u0027 Is a Real Consumer Product",
    "detailedContent": "Crypto is a world built for autodidacts, a playground for polymaths. Tarun Chitra, the founder of the risk management, economic research and software optimization organization Gauntlet, is just one shining example. In a conversation with Chitra, this comes through. It seems there is no corner of crypto he hasn’t examined. Chitra, who often takes his time to pause before answering questions, will be speaking at Consensus 2024, May 29-31, in Austin, Texas. CoinDesk caught up with the bona fide DeFi celebrity known for his colorful style (hair, glasses and clothes) to talk about new financial primitives in crypto, artificial wombs and why he appreciates hecklers. This interview has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity. I thought maybe we could start off with a quick round of overrated/underrated. You could skip any of them or clarify your statements if you prefer. Sure. Life extension? I have a very rough classification in my head of, like, passive versus active life extension. Passive is: I become healthier by eating better and maybe I take some supplements. Active is: I get all sorts of esoteric experimental therapies and, like, injections. You know what I mean, one involves surgeries and the other a simpler change in habits. I was thinking more of the former. Probably overrated. I think the latter is rated correctly. Yeah. Healthy living is good. But that\u0027s why I wanted to separate those. Artificial wombs? I actually think fairly rated. Maybe slightly underrated, actually. But not super underrated. I feel like they\u0027re getting a lot of hype. CLOBs [central limit order book exchanges]. Overrated. Could you say why? I think we had the era of CLOBs as the only thing that worked. Then AMMs took off and CLOBs were like crap. And then in the perpetuals and low-latency blockchain worlds everyone was like “CLOBs are better, CLOBs are better.” Not that we have seen a lot of people necessarily going back to CLOBs, but I feel like the tide has shifted right now. People are constantly sh*ting on AMMs. So that\u0027s fine. But it feels like there\u0027s always this cyclic thing between the two. See also: What Is an Automated Market Maker? Dutch auctions? One shot Dutch auctions are overrated. Multi-shot Dutch auctions are underrated. Omnichains? Can you define what you mean by omnichain for this context? Honestly, not so much. It\u0027s just a term that I’ve seen pop up a lot recently, and I can’t tell what they are. Yeah, well, I have found it to be more of a marketing term than anything real, to be totally honest. So overrated, it feels like it\u0027s not a real thing. It doesn\u0027t refer to a single technical thing that I could write down equations for and tell you like, “this is a guarantee you\u0027re getting from this.” That was the impression that I got as well. This is maybe a mean one, but Aave. Decline to answer. Who are your intellectual heroes? Paul Dirac. John von Neumann. I’m trying to think of a more recent one. The boring one is like the Terence Taos of the world. Is there someone who\u0027s not as famous? … Yeah, stick with those. Those are those well known enough, I feel like the other ones are way too niche. Fair enough. You wrote about DAO governance in 2021. I was wondering if you think we\u0027ve learned anything since then? if DAO governance has at all improved in the intervening years? I think there\u0027s kind of this thing where the actual governance processes for a lot of DAO either worsened or improved. Either due to sclerosis or due to centralized takeover or whatever, there\u0027s lots of reasons for one or the other. I don\u0027t think there have been many new mechanisms that people have focused on because you don\u0027t get rewarded for improving a DAO mechanism. See also: DAOs Beware: Neo-Imperialism Is on the Rise With Compound, I feel like because of the way they launched, they actually got rewarded as a team for improving DAO mechanisms when they decentralized governance in 2020. But since then everyone who has innovated on governance has been generally outside of DeFi. And those haven\u0027t made it. There\u0027s still a lot of mechanistic innovation that hasn\u0027t been done. And part of the reason that hasn\u0027t been done is it\u0027s underfunded relative to other things, right? Like you can raise much more money for making another robot than you could ever raise for a new governance system. When is it appropriate for crypto to embrace financial nihilism? As in, lean into it? Good question. Feels like we are currently leaning in. So I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s an answer to when it is appropriate – but hasn\u0027t it already happened? The problem for me is that financial nihilism is a real consumer application. Most other things considered crypto for consumers, people are like, it’s a scam, or a lie, or it doesn’t really need crypto at all it’d work fine as Web2 to me – I can go down the list. Financial nihilism is a real consumer product. Like there\u0027s no there\u0027s no way around it. It\u0027s hard to get around the fact that they\u0027ve found a way to make Binance more fun to someone who doesn\u0027t like looking at candles – and I think that\u0027s why Pump.fun exists. People love it because it\u0027s the same thing but it doesn\u0027t feel like it and that\u0027s a good consumer application. This will disappoint all the people who raise millions of dollars to do consumer crypto, but it\u0027s just what it is. Do you think Farcaster will ever fully supplant Crypto Twitter and would it be a loss to Farcaster if CT was recreated in full on Farcaster? Farcaster is like where the refugees of the WAGMI [we are all gonna make it] movement of 2021 went. It was all people who really were genuine in the beginning about being part of the cult of toxic positivity. I feel like the ones who were earnest about it went and made Farcaster. I just don\u0027t feel the trader-type people are ever going to perfectly intermesh, so it doesn\u0027t seem possible to fully re-create the “degen side.” Farcaster is so much more wholesome. Do you see any interesting financial primitives emerging that you think will become more and more important? I mean, in general, I think re-staking comes under that. But things that let you not know what network you\u0027re on, but give you the same security guarantees of that network; re-staking is one version of that, aggregation stuff that people are doing and ZK-land is one version of that. I think that\u0027s the key to making the UX of the multi-chain world feel anywhere near as good as something like Solana. There are concerns that there\u0027s already too much ETH staked or will soon be too much ETH staked. Do you buy into that argument? Is there an appropriate amount? That honestly depends. I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a static, fixed quantity that will always forever be the right amount. It depends on usage. If it turns out there\u0027s a lot of usage of ETH in applications on-chain or in centralized exchanges, then it\u0027s kind of bad to have a lot of ETH staked because then there\u0027s no liquidity and you could run into a supply crunch. On the other hand, if there is too little ETH staked, then yeah, of course, different types of attacks are possible. The biggest problem in some ways with proof-of-stake is that it’s easy to calculate the dollar-value of an attack. I can always just take 1/3 times the amount staked and figure out how expensive it is to attack. See also: The Investor\u0027s Definitive Guide to Proof-of-Work With proof-of-work, because people can join and leave, it takes a while to figure out how expensive an attack is and you can\u0027t figure it out quite as precisely. So the lower bound for proof-of-work is actually harder to estimate, and it’s actually harder to attack in some ways. So I think it\u0027s always gonna be dynamic. Some new technologies will help reduce how much you have to have staked – that\u0027s the point of ZK and advanced cryptography, but it will never be constant. It really just depends on how much applications want to use, and if applications are using ether a lot. How many pairs of glasses do you own? Probably like 10. And lastly, is there anything in particular that you\u0027re looking forward to at Consensus? Doing another live podcast. I was there last time. It was good! Yeah, the live podcasts are fun. Especially if you get like an audience heckler. I’ll try to think of something clever to heckle. Yeah well, thanks for stopping by.",

    "detailedContent": "Bitcoin layer 2s. Ethereum restaking. Interoperability. AI. DePIN. Next-generation cryptography. These are just a handful of the cutting-edge blockchain tech topics on the agenda at CoinDesk\u0027s Consensus 2024 conference, which runs Wednesday, May 29, through Friday, May 31, in Austin, Texas. For blockchain developers, it\u0027s red meat. For others, it may sound unfamiliar. For everyone, including those somewhere in between, the three days are packed with opportunities to learn about the hottest crypto tech on Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Cosmos and XRP Ledger – from the world\u0027s top experts. We took a spin through the agenda to identify stages and sessions likely to interest blockchain developers and people interested in the technology. In general there are six broad categories of relevant programming: The overall Consensus agenda is pretty sprawling. In terms of the blockchain tech highlights, the following would represent our picks. Wednesday: 1:45 p.m. (Mainstage): Joe Lubin of Consensys discusses Ethereum with Consensus Chair Michael Casey. 2:45 p.m. (Mainstage): Emin Gün Sirer, CEO, Ava Labs, the primary developer of Avalanche, joins a panel on what blockchain can do for AI, and what AI can do for crypto. 3 p.m. (Town Square): Bryan Bishop, early Bitcoin coder (and now a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal editor), discusses the early days on a panel with other crypto OGs. Thursday: 12:45 p.m. (Mainstage): David Marcus, former head of the Facebook/Meta Diem/Libra, talks about Lightspark, his digital-payments startup based on Bitcoin\u0027s Lightning Network. 1:15 p.m. (Mainstage): Sergey Nazarov, co-founder of Chainlink, talks about his project\u0027s work with the global banking-payments network Swift, in a panel moderated by CoinDesk\u0027s Sam Kessler. 4:15 p.m. (Town Square): John Adler, co-founder and chief research officer of Celestia Labs, and Austin Federa, head of strategy for Solana Foundation, discuss whether modular or monolithic blockchains are the better way to scale. Friday: 10 a.m. (Money Reimagined Stage): MakerDAO co-founder Rune Christensen discusses where DeFi is headed. 10:40 a.m. (Mainstage): Raj Gokal, co-founder and president of Solana Labs, discusses the network\u0027s future and the upcoming release of the Firedancer software designed to improve performance. 11 a.m. (Money Reimagined Stage): Helium CEO Abhay Kumar speaks on a panel about the future of \"decentralized physical infrastructure networks,\" or DePIN (formerly referred to as Internet of Things, or IoT). 11:30 a.m. (Mainstage): Casey Rodarmor, the developer who almost single-handedly created the two most impactful protocols launched atop Bitcoin in the past two years – Ordinals and Runes – talks about what comes next and his vision for the oldest and largest blockchain. 11:45 a.m. (Money Reimagined Stage): CoinDesk\u0027s Margaux Nijkerk leads a discussion on liquid staking and restaking. 12 p.m. (Town Square): AMA with Casey Rodarmor 12:15 p.m. (Startup Village): Injective co-founder Eric Chen discusses his vision for the future of finance. 3 p.m. (Money Reimagined Stage): Gauntlet co-founder Tarun Chitra speaks on a panel about \"de-risking DeFi,\" from preventing smart-contract bugs and rug pulls to dealing with treasury management strategies and audits.

    "title": "This Is (Hopefully) the Last CoinDesk Article to Mention Craig Wright",
    "detailedContent": "Craig Wright is not Satoshi Nakamoto and not the author of the Bitcoin white paper, as was determined by Justice James Mellor, who handed down that judgment after the COPA v Wright trial wrapped up. Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates. This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here. But not only is Craig Wright not Satoshi Nakamoto and not the author of the Bitcoin white paper, he also wasted the court’s time, according to Mellor’s much-anticipated, 231-page written assessment of the trial. As CoinDesk’s Camomile Shumba summarized: Wright is apparently looking to appeal the decision – a bad sign for anyone who wished that COPA’s brave attempt to actually litigate and settle the matter of whether CSW was stealing Satoshi’s valor (by stealing his identity) once and for all. Ever since he arrived on the scene in December 2015, Wright has been causing chaos for the crypto industry – including suing Bitcoin Core developers, public figures and a feline astronaut called Hodlonaut, who was an affirmed private citizen before his CSW imbroglio. And that was essentially the motivation behind COPA’s suit. Although all of CSW’s legal claims essentially centered around the claim that he invented Bitcoin (he was able to copyright the white paper), in all of his libel and infringement lawsuits over the years that was always an incidental issue. Read more: Craig Wright Assets Frozen by UK Judge to Prevent Him Evading Court Costs COPA, which is backed by Jack Dorsey and Coinbase, among others, put the question directly when it filed suit in 2021. Then, over several weeks in a U.K. court, the group was able to systematically prove to the court that Wright had been forging documents, spewing lies and filing costly and wasteful lawsuits for years. “This decision is a watershed moment for the open-source community and even more importantly, a definitive win for the truth. Developers can now continue their important work maintaining, iterating on, and improving the Bitcoin network without risking their personal livelihoods or fearing costly and time-consuming litigation from Craig Wright,” a COPA spokesperson said. In the judgment, which, really, goes above-and-beyond the call of duty to excoriate the Australian computer scientist, Justice Mellor said Wright \"lied to the court repeatedly,\" committed forgery \"on a grand scale\" and “is not nearly as clever as he thinks he is.” (The FT’s Alphaville has a nice rundown of the juiciest morsels from the document.) It’s not just that the judge appears to understand the extent of CSW’s grift, but also Bitcoin itself, arguing that seeking to control Bitcoin through the courts is something Satoshi would never dream of doing. So, with this, I think we may finally be able to bid Wright adieu. He has dropped his five-year legal actions against Holdonaut and podcaster Peter McCormack, and will no longer be able to pursue cases in the U.K., Wright’s chosen venue for the majority of his legal actions due to the nation’s extremely lax libel laws. Good night, sweet prince.",

    "detailedContent": "A Monday rally during the U.S. trading day put an end to what had been very muted crypto price action over the previous 72 hours, pushing bitcoin (BTC) above $68,000 for the first time in more than five weeks. At press time, the world\u0027s largest crypto was changing hands at $68,250. Leading the rally in crypto was Solana\u0027s (SOL), which has gained 7% over the past 24 hours, also to more than a five-week high. That outperformed both bitcoin\u0027s 2.6% advance and the CoinDesk 20\u0027s 2.8% rise.

Bitcoin rallied from just above the $60,000 to more than $66,000 by week\u0027s end. Alongside that rally came a renewal of big inflows into the spot bitcoin ETFs, which had previously witnessed net outflows over four of the previous seven weeks. All told, the spot funds added 14,389 bitcoin last week, according to HODL Capital, the strongest performance since March. Earlier Friday, Grayscale, the manager of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), announced the exit of CEO Michael Sonnenshein, who will be replaced by Goldman Sachs executive Peter Mintzberg. The move suggests Grayscale may have its eyes on a return to growing assets for GBTC as opposed to the current slow bleed of bitcoin from its holdings.",

    "detailedContent": "This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day. Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) were little changed, suggesting a consolidation after last week\u0027s rally. BTC traded at around $67,000 while ETH held steady about $3,100. The wider digital asset market as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) has added 0.3% in the last 24 hours. This week, attention will turn to the SEC\u0027s decision on the approval of ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with the deadline for a response to VanEck\u0027s and Ark/21 Shares\u0027 applications due on May 23 and May 24, respectively. Traders may be keeping their powder dry until then. Traders are also going to be eyeing Nvidia\u0027s earnings, scheduled for Wednesday. Bitcoin trades strongly in correlation with Nvidia, as do artificial intelligence-themed tokens, which surged in February as the chip designer reported better-than-expected earnings. NVDA has risen over 90% year-to-date, with analysts expecting the company to report a big increase in revenue for the quarter ending in April. The direct correlation between Nvidia and ether market movement isn\u0027t as strong as it once was during the mining boom. Still, the rising tide of bitcoin and AI tokens – should Nvidia\u0027s earnings remain strong – will likely lift all boats. Genesis will return 77% of customer assets, worth $3 billion in cash and crypto, to its creditors. Parent company DCG will not be among them. The lender\u0027s holding company filed for bankruptcy in January 2023 following the fallout from events in the crypto market the year before. In the immediate aftermath of the filing, the market was skeptical that customers would be made whole and the bankruptcy proceedings would be completed in an expedient manner. Bankruptcy claims marketplace Xclaim initially listed Genesis claims at 35% of their value in January 2023. As of today, Genesis claims for bitcoin or ether are trading at 97%-110% for claims over $10 million, while claims under $1 million are trading at 74%-94%. - Omkar Godbole",

    "title": "Ether, Bitcoin Open Asia Trading Week Flat as ETH ETF Decision, Nvidia Earnings Loom",
    "detailedContent": "The crypto market was listless early Monday, with bitcoin (BTC), the biggest digital asset market by value, trading flat at $67,156 and ether (ETH) changing hands at $3,127, according to CoinDesk Indices data. The consolidation follows a week of bullish action triggered by renewed optimism about a U.S. rate cut and the rally in stocks. Things could soon get busier again with the first decisions for ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) due. The Securities and Exchange Commission is set to weigh in on VanEck\u0027s ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) on May 23 and the Ark/21 Shares one on May 24, as well as Nvidia earnings. March Zheng, managing partner of Bizantine Capital, told CoinDesk in an interview that while the market has priced near the certainty of a rejection, there are still some reasons to be optimistic. \"There are reasons to believe that the report will contain silver linings for the delay, which should signal an eventual approval of Ethereum in the next year,\" Zheng said. \"The removal of staking prepositions by filers reclassifies underlying ETH as commodities supported by the CFTC and can pave a major pathway going forward.\" Polymarket currently gives a 10% chance of an ether ETF being approved by May 31, a 13% chance of approval by June 30, and a 28% chance of approval this year. Recently, Coinbase analyst David Han wrote that the market may be \"underestimating the timing and odds of a potential approval.\" Zheng argued that positive ETH ETF news might also boost trading sentiments for BASE, a Layer-2 network, whose native token\u0027s price has dropped by nearly 25% in the last two weeks. Traders are also going to be eyeing Nvidia\u0027s earnings, scheduled for Wednesday.

    "title": "Research Firm Favors Bitcoin \u0027Covered Strangle\u0027 Strategy to Enhance Portfolio Yield by 17%",
    "detailedContent": "Bitcoin (BTC) investors looking to generate extra income in addition to their spot market holdings should consider setting a \"covered strangle\" options strategy, research firm 10X, which has an impeccable record of predicting market trends, said Monday. The \u0027covered strangle\u0027 strategy involves holding the underlying asset in the spot market and simultaneously selling an out-of-the-money (OTM) call option at levels (known as strikes in options parlance) above the underlying asset\u0027s going market rate and selling an OTM put at strikes below the underlying\u0027s spot market price. The premium received for selling/shorting the call option, or protecting the counterparty from price rallies, and selling the put or insurance against downtrends, represents the extra yield. 10x suggests selling a $100,000 strike call, which is 50% above BTC\u0027s current market price, and a $50,000 strike put, both expiring in December 2024, while holding the cryptocurrency in the spot market. \"Our favorite strategy is to buy bitcoin Spot, Sell 100,000 strike call, and Sell 50,000 strike put for the December 2024 expiry. Selling the call could yield 11%, and selling the put could yield 6%,\" Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said in Monday\u0027s client note, detailing the suggestion. \"Hence, this strategy provides us with either a 17% downside buffer or 17% more yield, depending on where BTC closes in December, plus we would capture all the upside (or downside) for bitcoin,\" Thielen added. The strategy is preferred when the market outlook is bullish, but the uptrend is expected to unfold slowly, keeping implied volatility or investors\u0027 expectations for price turbulence low. In such conditions, options, particularly OTM call and put options, bleed value faster as expiry nears, making money for sellers. The strategy, though appealing, is now without risks and requires a high tolerance for risk. That\u0027s because the risk is leveraged below the level at which the put option is sold, in this case, $50,000. \"Below the lower strike price, both the long stock and short put incur losses, and, as a result, percentage losses are twice what they would be for a covered call position [buy spot \u003d sell OTM call] alone,\" Fidelity said in a \u0027covered strangle\" explainer. In other words, 10x\u0027s strategy is for those who believe bitcoin\u0027s bull market will progress slowly and corrections, if any, will not see prices drop below $50,000. As of writing, bitcoin changed hands at $67,170, representing a 58% year-to-date gain, CoinDesk data show. Several analysts, including Thielen and Arthur Hayes, former CEO of crypto exchange BitMEX, expect a slow grind higher.",

    "title": "Ether ETFs Filing Process Sees Abrupt Progress, Though Approval Not Guaranteed: Sources",
    "detailedContent": "The exchanges that want to list and trade shares of spot ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds are abruptly being asked by regulators to update key filings related to these products. Exchanges are being asked to update 19b-4 filings on an accelerated basis by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, three people familiar with the situation told CoinDesk, suggesting they may be moving to approve these applications ahead of a key deadline this Thursday. That doesn\u0027t mean the ETFs will be authorized, though. Would-be issuers also need their S-1 applications approved before the products could begin trading. SEC could take an indefinite amount of time to approve the S-1 documents, one person familiar with the matter said, as it isn\u0027t tied to a deadline. One company in talks with the SEC said it feels like it might be on the right track for approval, in a turnaround from feeling some weeks ago that the SEC was dragging its feet, according to a person familiar with the matter. Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart raised their odds for the approval of a spot ether ETF to 75% from 25% on Monday after hearing chatter that the SEC could be taking a more favorable stance towards the applications. They later corrected their statement, saying that the odds were related to the 19b-4 approvals. The SEC is expected to make a decision on VanEck spot ether ETF on May 23rd. The SEC has been investigating whether ether, the chief native asset to the Ethereum blockchain, is a security, launching a formal inquiry after the network moved from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake mechanism. If ether is deemed to be a security by the SEC, that may be one reason for the regulator to reject the spot ether ETF applications. One test of the agency\u0027s view on whether ETH is a security has newly emerged at Prometheum. The special purpose broker announced Monday it had soft-launched its ether custody service. The company eventually intends to launch custody and trading services for other digital assets – importantly, assets that are treated as securities in the U.S., not commodities.

    "title": "Ether, Bitcoin Open Asia Trading Week Flat as ETH ETF Decision, Nvidia Earnings Loom",
    "detailedContent": "The crypto market was listless early Monday, with bitcoin (BTC), the biggest digital asset market by value, trading flat at $67,156 and ether (ETH) changing hands at $3,127, according to CoinDesk Indices data. The consolidation follows a week of bullish action triggered by renewed optimism about a U.S. rate cut and the rally in stocks. Things could soon get busier again with the first decisions for ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) due. The Securities and Exchange Commission is set to weigh in on VanEck\u0027s ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) on May 23 and the Ark/21 Shares one on May 24, as well as Nvidia earnings. March Zheng, managing partner of Bizantine Capital, told CoinDesk in an interview that while the market has priced near the certainty of a rejection, there are still some reasons to be optimistic. \"There are reasons to believe that the report will contain silver linings for the delay, which should signal an eventual approval of Ethereum in the next year,\" Zheng said. \"The removal of staking prepositions by filers reclassifies underlying ETH as commodities supported by the CFTC and can pave a major pathway going forward.\" Polymarket currently gives a 10% chance of an ether ETF being approved by May 31, a 13% chance of approval by June 30, and a 28% chance of approval this year. Recently, Coinbase analyst David Han wrote that the market may be \"underestimating the timing and odds of a potential approval.\" Zheng argued that positive ETH ETF news might also boost trading sentiments for BASE, a Layer-2 network, whose native token\u0027s price has dropped by nearly 25% in the last two weeks. Traders are also going to be eyeing Nvidia\u0027s earnings, scheduled for Wednesday. Bitcoin trades strongly in correlation with Nvidia, as do Artificial intelligence-themed tokens, which surged in February as the chip designer reported better-than-expected earnings. The direct correlation between Nvidia and ether market movement isn\u0027t as strong as it once was during the mining boom. Still, the rising tide of bitcoin and AI tokens – should Nvidia\u0027s earnings remain strong – will likely lift all boats.",

    "title": "Ether Bears Hit a Brick Wall as Price Collides With Bull-Market Trendline",
    "detailedContent": "Ether\u0027s (ETH) sell-off has stalled, with bears hitting a brick wall characterized by an upward-sloping trendline drawn off October and January lows, according to charting platform TradingView. The bears\u0027 inability to penetrate that bull-market trendline since Monday suggests they might have to back up a bit and allow a price bounce before making another attempt at extending recent declines. The native token of the Ethereum blockchain has dropped more than 15% to $3,000 from highs near $4,100 two months ago, according to CoinDesk data. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), a measure of the broader crypto market, lost 17% in the same period. Supporting the case for an ether price bounce is the daily MACD histogram, which has flipped positive, signaling renewed bullish momentum. The MACD is widely used to gauge trend strength and changes. Intraday momentum is steadily improving, with the widely tracked 50-hour simple moving average (SMA) again trending north, providing reassurance. The immediate resistance is seen at the 50-day SMA near $3,180, followed by a descending trendline representing the recent correction, currently at $3,225. If the price drops below the bullish trendline, that would mean the broader uptrend has ended, opening the door for a more pronounced sell-off.",

    "title": "Bitcoin Traders Target $74K Next Week as BTC Spot ETFs Log Four Days of Inflows",
    "detailedContent": "Institutional demand and rising appetite for risk assets could cause bitcoin to breach all-time highs of $74,000 as early as next week, some traders say. “Bitcoin was pulling back towards $65K on Thursday but is already trying to regain its footing above $66K on Friday morning. If cryptocurrencies get support from the global risk appetite on Friday, Bitcoin could exceed $70K over the weekend,” shared Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro senior market analyst, in a note to CoinDesk, referring to increased inflows from spot ETFs. “A test of the $71K-$74K highs area, in our view, could happen as early as early next week, triggering a new episode of FOMO,” Kuptsikevich. Singapore-based QCP Capital gave out similar price targets in a client note earlier this week. Such bullish outlooks come as U.S.-listed spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking the asset have logged four straight days of inflows, ending Thursday at $257 million in net inflows. This is a nearly 180-degree turn from the action of the past few weeks – with some of the biggest ETFs seeing zero inflows on some days. BlackRock’s IBIT received $94 million in inflows on Thursday, the largest among peers. GrayScale’s GBTC, which has mostly seen outflows since its January listing, received over $4.6 million in inflows. Earlier this week, multiple regulatory filings showed that several big-name funds, such as Millennium Management and Elliot Capital, held millions worth of bitcoin ETFs in their portfolios. The softer-than-expected US Consumer Price Index (CPI), which rose 0.3% versus 0.4% in March amid economist forecasts for 0.4%, triggered a break out of the range for BTC on Wednesday. The asset regained the $66,000 mark for the first time since April and posted its biggest single-day gain since March.",

    "title": "Ether-Bitcoin Ratio Slides to Lowest Since April 2021. Here\u0027s Why",
    "detailedContent": "The ratio between ether (ETH) and bitcoin’s (BTC) dollar-denominated prices continues to slide, extending year-to-date losses as suggested by the bearish death cross pattern a month ago. ETH/BTC slipped to 0.04563 on crypto exchange Binance soon before press time, reaching the lowest since April 2021, according to charting platform TradingView. This year, the ratio has declined nearly 16%, indicating a bias for bitcoin or the leading cryptocurrency by market value. The slide to three-year lows follows reduced demand for exchange-traded products (ETPs) tied to ether. According to Bloomberg data quoted by ETC Group in its weekly report, global ether ETPs registered net outflows of around $63.5 million last week, with Hong Kong-listed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) losing the most. Meanwhile, bitcoin ETPs raked in $92.5 million last week. Several factors, including competing layer 1s and lingering uncertainty about the debut of spot ETH approvals in the U.S, are likely responsible for ETH falling out of investor favor. “The approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has reinforced bitcoin’s store-of-value narrative and its status as a macro asset. On the other hand, open questions about ETH’s fundamental positioning within the crypto sector remain. Competing layer-1s (L1s) like Solana detract from Ethereum’s positioning as the \u0027go-to\u0027 network for decentralized app (dApp) deployment,” Coinbase Institutional’s Research analyst David Han said in a note Wednesday. Solana’s share in total decentralized exchange volumes has grown tenfold from 2% to 21% in one year, eating into Ethereum\u0027s market share. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) green-lighted nearly a dozen spot BTC ETFs in January. Since then, these funds have drawn roughly $12 billion in net inflows, according to data source Farside Investors. Approval of spot ETFs tied to ether will open a similar pool of capital for Ethereum’s native token, although it’s unclear when the SEC will approve it. Traders on decentralized betting platform Polymarket see just a 10% chance of the SEC approving a spot ETF on or before May 31. The regulator has until May 23 to decide whether to approve or reject VanEck’s application to launch a spot Ethereum ETF. The deadline for BlackRock’s application is June 23. According to finance lawyer Scott Johnsson, the SEC is looking for reasons to deny ETH ETF applications by BlackRock and others on grounds that they have been improperly filed as commodity-based trust shares and do not qualify if they hold a security. Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets at Marex Solutions, said ether is a \"lightning rod\" for negative sentiment from crypto native and external players and has several weak spots. “Capital gets fragmented. There are proportionally greater numbers of ways to get exposure to the ecosystem through the many Layer 2s tokens (OP, ARB…) and native protocol tokens in each one. The capital gets fragmented,\" Solot said in an email. Solot added that strong anti-ETH sentiment from [rival] Solana community and Bitcoin propounders is driving negative ether narratives and the high beta cryptocurrency is a \"perfect vehicle\" for external players to express bearish view given it trades on traditional exchanges such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Lastly, Ether recently turned inflationary, reversing the bullish deflationary supply trend seen consistently since its parent network Ethereum transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus ecosystem in September 2022.",

    "detailedContent": "Bullish sentiment for riskier assets following soft inflation figures could propel bitcoin (BTC) prices toward the $74,000 mark in the coming days as institutional demand continues to grow, Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a note early Thursday. The softer-than-expected U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.3% versus 0.4% in March amid economist forecasts for 0.4%, triggering a breakout for BTC. The asset regained the $66,000 mark for the first time since April and posted its biggest single-day gain since March. Such a move, coupled with demand from traditional finance, could see bitcoin regaining its March record of $73,700. “We expect bullish momentum here that could take us back to the highs of nearly $74,000,” QCP traders said. “The desk saw sizeable buyers of $100K-$120k BTC Calls for Dec 2024 on this move higher in spot.” “Institutional demand for bitcoin continues to grow, with large asset managers Millennium and Schonfeld investing approximately 3% and 2% of their AUM into the BTC spot ETF,” they added. Multiple filings on Wednesday showed that several big-name funds, such as Millenium Management and Elliot Capital, held millions worth of bitcoin ETFs in their portfolios. Meanwhile, some analysts say the selling pressure on bitcoin appears to have eased off, citing on-chain and exchange data. “Short-term Bitcoin holders are selling at basically zero profit and traders are depleting their unrealized profits in the last few months,” CryptoQuant analysts shared in a Thursday report. “Bitcoin balances at OTC desks stabilizing, which suggests there is less Bitcoin supply coming into the market to sell via these entities.” The firm defines short-term traders as addresses that hold bitcoin for less than 155 days and are likely to capitalize on short-term price movements. A breakout in bitcoin comes after weeks of low volatility. Since March, the market has been range-bound between $60,000 and $70,000, with the halving event in April not providing the expected boost due to a general lack of market catalysts, traders have previously said. Higher risk appetite for token bets showed signs of beginning earlier this week after an X post by retail trader Keith Gill sent some meme stocks and meme coins surging. Gill\u0027s online persona and investment strategies contributed to a short squeeze on video game retailer GameStop’s stock in 2021, and his first post on social application X in three years was considered by some to be a sign of market volatility in the months ahead.",

The developers said the increased use of the Shibarium blockchain for transactions will result in a higher burn rate for the SHIB token, reducing supply. The SHIB price has risen 8.8% in the past 24 hours, in line with a broader market jump. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), a measure of the wider crypto market, has rallied almost 7%. Users can now float new liquidity pools (LPs) on Shibarium, allowing traders to swap tokens on the network and earn a cut of trading fees for providing liquidity. ShibaSwap held over $25 million in locked tokens as of Thursday, data shows, with $1.7 million in trading volumes in the past 24 hours. “The more transactions will run on Shibarium blockchain, the more the protocol will burn base gas fees which will impact the overall burn rate of $SHIB,” they said. Burns refer to the permanent removal of tokens from circulating supply by sending them to an address that no one controls. Every swap and stake on ShibaSwap contributes to the ecosystem\u0027s growth as increased trading volumes bring higher fees for stakers and LP providers, developers said in an X post.",

    "detailedContent": "Futures powerhouse Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) plans to offer spot bitcoin trading to clients as demand for the product mounts among market participants, the Financial Times reported on Thursday. CME is already the top bitcoin futures exchange by open interest, while offshore, non-regulated Binance dominates the spot market. The exchange has held discussions with traders who want to trade bitcoin on a regulated marketplace, the FT reported, citing people with direct knowledge of the talks. CME\u0027s spot trading business could be run through the EBS currency trading venue in Switzerland, the report added. The exchange did not want to comment on the report. The spot market will complement the CME’s existing standard and micro futures contracts, which are widely considered a proxy for institutional activity, and help the exchange become more dominant in the crypto market. The CME is already the top bitcoin futures exchange by open interest, while the offshore, non-regulated Binance dominates the spot market. Coinbase (COIN), the only U.S. traded crypto exchange, is No. 3 by daily trading volume.

    "title": "GameStop Rally Sends Meme Coins Skywards; PEPE, FLOKI, MOG Surge",
    "detailedContent": "Top meme coins climbed higher Tuesday after a viral post by retail trader Keith Gill, whose cult following contributed to the GameStop short squeeze of 2021, sent some stocks and tokens flying at the start of the week. Gill, who turned $58,000 into an estimated $50 million between 2019 and 2021 by buying GameStop (GME) options, sparked a run in the stock after posting from his @TheRoaringKitty X account for the first time in three years. A mere picture posted by Gill sent the stock skywards, nearly doubling in value on Monday despite multiple trading halts, even as Gill did not directly mention Gamestop. GameSpot’s retail euphoria quickly spread to token markets. Several offshoots and joke tokens referring to GameStop, Gill, and his online kitten persona flooded Solana and Ethereum blockchains – with a meme GME token surging as much as 500%. A video featuring the X-Men character Wolverine posted later on by Gill caused dozens of WOLVERINE tokens floated by opportunistic developers, most falling over 90% in the hours following. The action was not limited to microcaps. Larger tokens Pepe (PEPE) and floki (FLOKI), and cat-themed tokens popcat (POPCAT) and mog (MOG) jumped as much as 30% in the past 24 hours, data shows. Such revival showed an early sign of risk appetite returning to the crypto markets following weeks of relatively lull trading action. Gill’s post revived talks of a dogecoin (DOGE) rally among some traders, similar to its 2021, which occurred after GameStop’s run from $4 to $120 in a month. “Roaring Kitty is living proof that retail can mog (outperform) institutions at the highest level,” MOG token developer Shisui told CoinDesk in a message. “His return was perceived as bullish for meme coins because the market remembered that much of the Gamestop mania of 2021 spilled over to $DOGE and other meme coins.” “While we are far from being in a true risk-on environment, the price movements after Roaring Kitty’s comeback hint at which assets will outperform when frothy conditions return. The market has shown its hand, and it wants $MOG,” Shisui added. Among developers and traders, part of Gill’s influential appeal isn’t only that he has made generational wealth: It’s the allure of a single trader taking down hedge funds from his bedroom using publicly available tools and the chance of them landing a similar move. That has contributed to the general acceptance of meme tokens and made the sector a strong contender to DeFi and utility crypto projects compared to previous cycles, some opine. “The industry is only just starting to come to grasp with memes being fun, relatable, enjoyable, and representative of the average person,” said B, lead developer at Floki, in a note to CoinDesk. “The vast majority of retail is flocking over to meme coins and ignoring the tired old \"utility\" crypto projects.” “While many are worried about the \"lack of fundamentals surrounding meme coins\" and the implications of the continued attention they are getting for the space, the strong interest in meme coins was something I predicted years ago,” B said. He pointed out that Floki has now been focused on utility products to engage its audience that initially purchased the tokens as simply a meme.",

    "title": "Bitcoin Runes Protocol Sees Traction Waning After Much-Hyped Introduction",
    "detailedContent": "Activity on the Bitcoin Runes protocol has slowed over the past week, a sign it has failed to generate meaningful traction among users despite a stellar start last month. Runes takes the Ordinals protocol a step further by making transactions even cheaper and faster. Ordinals are a way to embed data into the Bitcoin blockchain by inscribing references to digital art into small Bitcoin-based transactions. The much-hyped Runes went live after Bitcoin’s fourth halving on April 20. Data tracked on Dune Analytics shows that in its first 10 days the protocol racked up more than 85,000 token issuances and generated over $3 million in fees. In the past two weeks, however, all the metrics – including fees, new Runes and user activity – have dropped more than 50%. Only some 5,000 new Runes have been issued since May 1, generating just under $100,000 in fees. At its peak, Runes led transactions and fees in the broader Bitcoin ecosystem, accounting for as much as 80% of all network activity. Now it\u0027s 20%. Worth noting, however, is that the downturn came amid a general market decline marked by falling bitcoin (BTC) prices and slow growth in alternative tokens, which may have contributed to a drop in sentiment for novel technology. Runes generated massive interest on social platform X before its launch with creator Casey Rodamor aiming to make it a protocol ripe for meme coin trading and “degen” traders. Some industry participants expected the protocol to mirror the flourishing meme coin ecosystem on blockchains such as Solana and Base – likely fueling interest and bets on little-known memes. PUPS, a Runes token, emerged as a big play and surged from under $10 million capitalization to over $150 million in under a week, gaining support from several noted traders such as BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes. Several NFT collections and tokens were launched on Ordinals, and even on Ethereum, before the protocol\u0027s introduction – each aiming to transfer over and become the biggest compilation after the launch. Such activity made Bitcoin-based NFTs top other collections on the usual leaders Ethereum and Solana, with tens of millions exchanging hands in an otherwise scant market for non-fungible tokens. Some skeptics say that while Runes may serve as a way to build the Bitcoin ecosystem, there’s still work to be done. \"The success of the Bitcoin L2 project based on OP_Return is doubtful as UTXO based blockchain network is fundamentally different from smart contract based network,\" Ho Chan Chung, head of marketing at CryptoQuant, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. \"The current notion of Bitcoin narrative as a digital currency combined, and the difference in the blockchain network fundamental are the two big hurdles that Bitcoin L2 projects need to overcome.\" \"Lightning network was able to prove it. However, Ordinals, BRC-20, and Runes all seemed to fail at winning the narrative for now.\" Chung added.",

Gill’s initial $53,000 investment was worth nearly $50 million at its peak, emerging as a rags-to-riches story of a lone trader making a fortune from his bedroom by betting against hedge funds.

    "detailedContent": "Bullish sentiment for riskier assets following soft inflation figures could propel bitcoin (BTC) prices toward the $74,000 mark in the coming days as institutional demand continues to grow, Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a note early Thursday. The softer-than-expected U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.3% versus 0.4% in March amid economist forecasts for 0.4%, triggering a breakout for BTC. The asset regained the $66,000 mark for the first time since April and posted its biggest single-day gain since March. Such a move, coupled with demand from traditional finance, could see bitcoin regaining its March record of $73,700. “We expect bullish momentum here that could take us back to the highs of nearly $74,000,” QCP traders said. “The desk saw sizeable buyers of $100K-$120k BTC Calls for Dec 2024 on this move higher in spot.” “Institutional demand for bitcoin continues to grow, with large asset managers Millennium and Schonfeld investing approximately 3% and 2% of their AUM into the BTC spot ETF,” they added. Multiple filings on Wednesday showed that several big-name funds, such as Millenium Management and Elliot Capital, held millions worth of bitcoin ETFs in their portfolios. Meanwhile, some analysts say the selling pressure on bitcoin appears to have eased off, citing on-chain and exchange data. “Short-term Bitcoin holders are selling at basically zero profit and traders are depleting their unrealized profits in the last few months,” CryptoQuant analysts shared in a Thursday report. “Bitcoin balances at OTC desks stabilizing, which suggests there is less Bitcoin supply coming into the market to sell via these entities.” The firm defines short-term traders as addresses that hold bitcoin for less than 155 days and are likely to capitalize on short-term price movements. A breakout in bitcoin comes after weeks of low volatility. Since March, the market has been range-bound between $60,000 and $70,000, with the halving event in April not providing the expected boost due to a general lack of market catalysts, traders have previously said. Higher risk appetite for token bets showed signs of beginning earlier this week after an X post by retail trader Keith Gill sent some meme stocks and meme coins surging. Gill\u0027s online persona and investment strategies contributed to a short squeeze on video game retailer GameStop’s stock in 2021, and his first post on social application X in three years was considered by some to be a sign of market volatility in the months ahead.",

    "title": "Bitcoin First, Not Only: Fostering Widespread Adoption Through Education",
    "detailedContent": "As bitcoin (BTC) continues to gain traction worldwide, the approach to introducing it to newcomers plays a crucial role in its widespread adoption. While some advocates firmly believe in a \"Bitcoin only\" narrative, this aggressive stance can often hinder the conversation and deter potential adopters. Instead, a \"Bitcoin first\" approach, which prioritizes education and understanding, may prove more effective in fostering genuine interest and long-term investment in bitcoin. Burak Tamac is an adjunct professor at Montclair State University, teaching politics and technology. This essay is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package published to coincide with the fourth Bitcoin “halving” in April 2024. Proponents of the \"Bitcoin only\" narrative often argue passionately for the superiority of bitcoin over other cryptocurrencies. However, this approach can come across as confrontational and off-putting to those who are new to the concept. When people feel attacked or told that their current investments are wrong, they are more likely to disengage from the conversation entirely. This is particularly true in countries like Turkey, where many individuals are already familiar with alternative investments like altcoins. To effectively promote bitcoin adoption, the focus should shift from telling people what to do to providing them with the knowledge to make informed decisions. By presenting bitcoin as the first step in understanding the broader cryptocurrency landscape, educators can help people grasp the unique features and advantages of bitcoin without disparaging other investments outright. When individuals learn about the Bitcoin network\u0027s decentralized nature, its limited supply and its potential as a store of value, they can better appreciate its significance. This foundation of knowledge allows them to evaluate other cryptocurrencies more critically and recognize the authenticity of bitcoin\u0027s value proposition. See also: Allen Farrington: Capital in the 21st Century | Opinion Encouraging people to blindly invest in bitcoin without proper understanding is a short-sighted approach. When individuals buy bitcoin solely based on hype or fear of missing out, they are more likely to panic sell during market fluctuations. This behavior not only harms their personal financial well-being but also discourages them to learn more about bitcoin. In contrast, when people invest in bitcoin after learning about its fundamentals and long-term potential, they are more likely to hold their investments through market cycles. This informed decision-making promotes stability and helps to build a stronger, more resilient Bitcoin community. To accelerate bitcoin adoption, I believe advocates should prioritize education to start a conversation; and the education should not start about what they do wrong, but what they can do more. By presenting bitcoin as the first step in a journey of financial literacy and technological understanding, we can create a more welcoming and inclusive environment for newcomers. By adopting a \"Bitcoin first\" approach that prioritizes education and understanding, we can create a more welcoming and empowering environment for newcomers. This shift in narrative, from \"Bitcoin only\" to \"Bitcoin first,\" has the potential to accelerate adoption.",

    "detailedContent": "Meme coins and artificial intelligence (AI)-linked tokens led gains in the past 24 hours as bitcoin and other major tokens started to reverse weekend losses. Bitcoin (BTC) added 3.3% to trade around $66,600 in European morning hours, buoyed by reports prospective ETF providers said they had been approved to offer bitcoin and ether exchange-traded funds in Hong Kong. Solana meme coins, dog-themed meme coins and Base network meme coins jumped over 15% on average, CoinGecko category data shows, while AI tokens zoomed over 17%. There was no apparent catalyst for the jumps. Tokens of layer-1 blockchains, such as ether (ETH), Solana’s SOL and Avalanche’s AVAX, were among the worst-performing categories, with an average rise of 5.5%. The broad-based CoinDesk 20, a liquid index of major tokens, minus stablecoins, rose nearly 6%. On-chain analysis tool Lookonchain said in an X post that whales, a colloquial term for wealthy traders whose actions can move token prices, picked up millions of dollars worth of meme tokens cat in a dogs world (MEW) and slerf (SLERF). Prices for the two rose almost 80% in the past 24 hours. Profit taking ahead of the halving, due later this week, and macroeconomic tremors weighed on the market since late Friday, with bitcoin dropping from last week’s highs around $70,500 to as low as $62,800. That caused a market-wide decline as majors dropped as much as 18%. As a result, $2 billion in futures positions were liquidated over the weekend, the most since March. Over $1.5 billion of those positions were betting on higher prices, data from analysis tool Coinalyze shows. A Coinalyze representative told CoinDesk in an X message that the leverage flush caused open interest – or the number of unsettled futures contracts – to drop $13 billion since Friday, indicative of bets being closed. Some traders said the price fall was expected ahead of the halving, a much-anticipated event on April 20 that will cut the rewards offered to network miners by half. “While previous halving events have historically been followed by 9-12 months of uptrend, they have often triggered short-term \u0027sell the news\u0027 reactions before and after the event,” Matteo Greco, a research analyst at digital asset investment firm Fineqia International, told CoinDesk in an email. “This short-term bearish sentiment is also reflected in the net outflow of $85 million from Bitcoin Spot ETFs during the week, signaling increased profit-taking and investor caution following the strong uptrend in both Q4 2023 and Q1 2024,” Greco added, referring to bitcoin ETF products in the U.S.",

    "detailedContent": "Bitcoin’s (BTC) much anticipated halving event later this month could see a flurry of bets on related networks and ecosystem tokens, with traders expecting upside on both technical and meme coin projects. Halving reduces the rate at which new coins are created and lowers the available new supply. The current block reward is 6.25 BTC, and it will drop to 3.125 BTC after the halving. This event has historically preceded a bull market for the token. Crypto traders say participants seek a “reason to buy” as money narratives continuously shift in the current bullish environment and they may turn their focus on the bitcoin ecosystem in the coming weeks. “There exists a large, untapped pool of capital within the Bitcoin ecosystem that remains dormant, and surprisingly few listed assets that traders can use to gain exposure to the narrative,” the OTC desk of trading firm Wintermute told CoinDesk over email. “Should capital begin to rotate into the Bitcoin ecosystem, tokens like $RUNE, $STX, and $ORDI could benefit significantly and outperform,” they added. THORChain’s RUNE and Stack’s STX have been among the top-performing tokens in the past year, CoinGecko data shows, tracking a bitcoin rise. Meme coin ordi (ORDI) – a nod to the Ordinals protocol on Bitcoin – has surged over 2,500% since its September issuance. Meanwhile, Bartosz Lipinski is the founder of the crypto trading platform Cube.Exchange said in an email that meme coins and the upcoming Runes protocol could rile up risky bets in the bitcoin ecosystem. “Ethereum’s high costs and significant network congestion will cause it to take a backseat as Bitcoin-based projects, like Rune, will redirect meme coin hype to the Bitcoin ecosystem because of the novelty,” Lipinski said. “The BRC-20 (Ordinals NFT) standard is likely to be overtaken by Runes, which is expected to launch on the day of the halving.” “Runes will aim to replace the standard with fungible tokens, which will enable the efficient creation of meme coins to compete with projects on Base and Solana,” he added, referring to the ongoing frenzy for non-serious tokens in the two ecosystems. Ordinals are a way to embed data into the Bitcoin blockchain by inscribing references to digital art into small Bitcoin-based transactions. Ordinal volumes were higher than those of usual leaders Ethereum and Solana in the past week, as reported, led by NodeMonkes and Pups. Non-fungible token (NFT) on other networks buying and selling activity declined 95% across all networks in the same period, suggestive of an isolated interest in Ordinals.",

    "detailedContent": "Money is flowing back into social application Friend.Tech as a new version teases an eventual airdrop, bringing users back to what was among the biggest revenue-generating platforms during the bear market. Over $7 million flowed to Friend.Tech last week after months of outflows, boosting the value locked to nearly $40 million, data shows. Weekly fees have crossed $1.3 million for the first time since November, making the platform over $600,000 in revenue. Built on Base, a layer-2 network, Friend.Tech lets crypto personalities on X issue “shares” for access to a closed group chat. For users, the allure of these chats is that their owners could offer trading insights, token picks or access to seed-funding deals – which raises the value of the shares. The bump in activity precedes the coming of version 2 of the application, which developers said will be released after April 20. A key element of the update is expanding the platform beyond X to attract newer users. Over the weekend, developers also teased a FRIEND token. Expectations among users are that these could be distributed based on how many points – a reward for Friend.Tech usage – they accumulate before the token release. Friend.tech was earning in excess of $1 million per day in fees at its August peak after going viral on X and gaining more than 100,000 unique users, a significant number for crypto application standards. Shares of some crypto X personalities, such as @Cobie and @HsakaTrades, jumped to as much as three ether, or nearly $5,000, at the time. Activity fell off in the months following as the initial allure wore off. Security risks later marred the platform alongside opportunities elsewhere in the sector, leading to months of outflows since November.",

    "title": "Bitcoin Cash Spikes 10% After Halving, Bitcoin Hovers Above $66K",
    "detailedContent": "Bitcoin Cash (BCH) surged 10% after completing its reward halving event, becoming one of the few gainers in an otherwise tepid market as bitcoin (BTC) – whose own halving occurs later this month – remained little changed over 24 hours. BCH changed hands at $660 in European morning hours, a price level not seen since December 2021. The token remains 80% below a lifetime peak of $3,700 set in December 2017. Bitcoin Cash’s block reward is now 3.125 BCH. Halving occurs when the reward for mining transactions is cut by 50%, reducing the rate at which new coins are created and thus lowering the available new supply. Bitcoin’s own halving is expected on April 20, trackers show, and has historically preceded a bull market for the token. The previous halving, in 2020, spurred a 1,000% run to a then-record high of $69,000 roughly a year and a half later. Read more: Bitcoin Halving, Explained Open interest on BCH-tracked futures swelled to $700 million earlier this week from below $200 million in March, showing an increase in leveraged bets on more expected price volatility, as previously reported. Meanwhile, crypto markets remained little changed in the past 24 hours amid the lack of market-moving catalysts. Bitcoin traded at just above $66,300, up 0.3% in the past 24 hours, and the CoinDesk 20, a broad-based liquid index of major tokens, excluding stablecoins, was down 0.7%. Ether (ETH), BNB Chain’s BNB and Solana’s (SOL) were up 1%, while dogecoin (DOGE), Polkadot’s DOT, XRP and Cardano’s ADA were down as much as 1.2%. Alex Kuptsikevich, a senior market analyst at FxPro, told CoinDesk in an email that the current lull was expected and traders were likely to be waiting for macroeconomic catalysts before making a move. “While Bitcoin\u0027s inability to rise is alarming, we saw a weaker dollar and stronger stock indices the day before, which is fuelling risk appetite,” Kuptsikevich said. “The cryptocurrency market\u0027s lagging performance can easily be attributed to accumulated overbought conditions and wariness ahead of the monthly labour market report,\u0027’ which is due tomorrow. “At the same time, we regard the current weakness as consolidation within the bull market, almost excluding the risks of a long-term reversal,” he said.",

    "title": "Why William Hinman`s Emails Matter to the XRP Army and the Crypto’s Price",
    "detailedContent": "On June 13, 2023, documents tied to William Hinman, the former director of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s Division of Corporation Finance from 2017 to 2020, were released to the public in connection with the SEC\u0027s lawsuit against Ripple, briefly sending the price of the XRP token up 7.4% as optimism spread that Ripple would win their ongoing case. Here’s why: Very broadly, Ripple and its partisans have argued that the Hinman emails could reveal a biased or flawed process behind the decision to publicly suggest in a 2018 speech by Hinman that Ethereum (ETH) may not be a security. One smoking gun might have been some sort of display of bias against Ripple and XRP, but the released emails do not mention either directly. Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty argued after the release that the emails showed Hinman ignoring warnings from colleagues that his speech was not grounded in law and created confusion about securities designations. At the very least, Alderoy seems to be suggesting Ripple has been treated unfairly by regulators. Early analysis of the emails does not seem to have found a major win for Ripple Labs, however. After a short rally on the morning of the emails’ release, XRP retraced its price and headed even lower, which may reflect some disappointment on this front. Ahead of the documents’ release, Ripple and XRP supporters had been focused on statements by Hinman suggesting that a token isn’t a security if it is “sufficiently decentralized.” That metric seems to have been used to justify a public carveout for Ethereum, but, at least according to feedback given to Hinman by other SEC staff and officials, was not grounded in existing securities regulation. Ripple has argued that XRP, like Ethereum, is “sufficiently decentralized” and should not be classified as a security according to the standards laid out by Hinman. Critics have long argued, however, that the underlying claim that Ethereum and XRP are comparably decentralized is itself highly debatable. Most significantly, there has now been close to a decade of debate and litigation over whether Ripple itself should be considered the creator of the XRP ledger and issuer of the XRP token – and therefore the issuer and seller of an unregistered security. Ripple Labs allies generally characterize the company as separate from XRP. In particular, they have argued that the XRP blockchain was created by Jed McCaleb and Chris Larsen, working as OpenCoin, before an entity called “Ripple” even existed. But OpenCoin became Ripple Labs and what is today simply called Ripple, and those cofounders “gifted” 80 billion XRP, 80% of the total supply, to Ripple Labs. Over the years, Ripple has made a variety of branding and messaging changes to represent that they are not the creators of XRP. That includes changing the preferred way to discuss the token itself, which for many years was commonly referred to as “Ripple.” Read More: What Is Ripple and the XRP Cryptocurrency? To critics such as Preston Byrne, this looks like an orchestrated deception, and one of the earliest instances of “decentralization theater.” And if XRP was effectively created or issued by Ripple, the parallel to Ethereum breaks down quickly, since Ethereum has no corporate for-profit parent. This could be a more compelling explanation for the different regulatory treatment of the two chains than bias or procedural failures. In any case, however the case develops and is ultimately decided, whenever new information is released that supporters believe bolsters or hurts Ripple\u0027s side of the case, XRP\u0027s price generally moves in parallel with the positive or negative sentiment.

    "title": "Binance Crypto Exchange: Your Questions Answered",
    "detailedContent": "Founded in 2017 by Changpeng Zhao, who is often referred to as just “CZ,” Binance is the world\u0027s leading cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume as of June 2023. The company was originally based in China but had to leave Shanghai due to regulatory restrictions shortly after its launch. Binance developed its own blockchain, Binance Smart Chain (later renamed to BNB Chain), which facilitates trades on the exchange. The native token of the blockchain is Binance coin (BNB) and the company has also launched a stablecoin, BinanceUSD (BUSD). Because of U.S. regulatory rules, Binance created a supposedly separate company for its U.S. clients in 2019, Binance.US. On June 5, 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed charges against Binance.US as well as CZ, who serves as Binance CEO, on allegations of violating federal securities laws by offering BNB and BUSD to the general public, calling them unregistered securities. The SEC lawsuit also casts fresh doubt on the independence of the company’s U.S. arm and its staking service. Read more about the SEC suit here This is not Binance’s first battle with U.S. regulators. Binance is also under ongoing scrutiny from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) who sued CZ and Binance in March 2023, alleging the company knowingly offered unregistered crypto derivatives products in the U.S. Here is everything you need to know about Binance, Binance.US and CEO Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao. CZ is a well-known personality in crypto, actively engaging with the crypto community through Twitter and speaking at conferences and to the media. As for his origins, he was born in China and emigrated to Canada when he was 12 and says he is a Canadian citizen. In high school, he worked part-time at McDonald’s, which is part of his well-known lore. He graduated from McGill University with a degree in Computer Science. After college, he worked for the Tokyo stock exchange and Bloomberg Tradebook developing software for the businesses. He then founded a startup in 2005, Fusion Systems, which focused on creating an automated high-frequency trading platform. Following that, he worked for several crypto startups including a stint as co-founder and CTO of OKCoin. Another piece of the CZ lore is that he first heard about Bitcoin at a poker game, which planted the seed that led him to create his own cryptocurrency exchange, Binance. According to the white paper, Zhao\u0027s goal for Binance was to compete with other exchanges by offering solutions to the numerous problems he saw with the cryptocurrency trading infrastructure – including poor technical architecture, insecure platforms, low market liquidity, poor customer support and poor language support. Shortly after Binance’s 2017 launch, Binance raised $15 million through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) for BNB, the terms of which were also laid out in the white paper. Binance started as one big company, founded in Shanghai in 2017. Because of China’s crackdown on crypto, the company left shortly after and while there were efforts to relocate the headquarters to Singapore and Malta was once thought to be Binance’s base, CZ currently claims that Binance has no headquarters and that wherever he is, that is where Binance is based. Binance also has a native coin, Binance Coin (BNB), which was initially launched on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token and subsequently migrated to Binance\u0027s proprietary blockchain, BNB Chain. BNB functions as an exchange token, meaning holders of BNB with Binance accounts can access discounted fees on the exchange. Binance created Binance.US in 2019 in response to regulatory requirements in the United States and notified customers that their accounts would be required to migrate to the new U.S-based exchange in November 2020. That said, many people noted that by using a VPN service, U.S.-based customers could still use Binance’s services. One of the biggest differences between the two exchanges is that Binance.com offers a much wider range of cryptocurrencies, with over 500 available for trading. Binance.US offers over 120 cryptocurrencies and is not available in all states as of writing, with Hawaii, New York, Texas, and Vermont blocking use of the exchange. The other big difference is that Binance.US does not offer margin trading or futures contracts, while Binance does. Both platforms offer low fees. Finally, unlike Binance’s stance that it has no headquarters, the U.S. arm is clearly based in Palo Alto, California. The SEC suit is specifically against Binance.US and Zhao and not the larger exchange. July 2017: Binance launches and raises $15 million through its BNB ICO. July 2018: Binance acquires Trust Wallet, a free, non-custodial mobile wallet to support its upcoming decentralized exchange (DEX) offering. January 2019: Binance starts to offer support for new token listings through ICOs (initial coin offerings) and IEOs (initial exchange offerings), through its Launchpad product. April 2019: Binance migrates BNB from Ethereum to its proprietary chain, then called Binance Smart Chain (now rebranded to Binance chain or BNB chain) April 2019: Binance launches its DEX ahead of schedule. May 2019: Binance gets hacked for the first time. Hackers steal over 7,000 bitcoin (BTC) from Binance (the equivalent of roughly $41 million at the time). Zhao quickly took to social media to reassure users that no one lost funds and that Binance used its reserve funds to cover the costs of the stolen crypto. CZ\u0027s \"Funds are #SAFU\" tweet has become a meme in the crypto space. June 2019: Binance announces it will launch a new trading platform for U.S. customers, in partnership with a firm called BAM Trading Services. July 2019: Binance hires former Ripple executive, Catherine Coley, to run its planned U.S. marketplace. September 2019: Binance launches its own dollar-backed stablecoin, BUSD in partnership with the Paxos Trust Company. September 2019: Binance.US launches in 37 states. The new marketplace supports six cryptocurrencies at launch: bitcoin, (BTC), ether (ETH), XRP, bitcoin cash (BCH), litecoin (LTC), tether (USDT) and BNB. BUSD is notably not supported at launch. April 2020: Binance buys CoinMarketCap, a cryptocurrency data provider, for a rumored $400 million, making it one of the biggest M\u0026A deals in crypto. “CoinMarketCap has more users than any other product in the crypto space,” Zhao said at the time. “It’s a very valuable platform.” September 2020: Binance rolls out Launchpool, a crypto staking platform. November 2020: Binance notifies U.S. customers they have a hard deadline of two weeks to migrate to the new platform before Binance shutters their accounts. April 2021: Binance.US hires Brian Brooks as CEO to replace Catherine Coley in the role. August 2021: Binance.US CEO Brian Brooks quits over “strategic differences” after just months in the job. September 2021: Binance.US promotes Brian Schroder to CEO; he formerly served as president and board member for the firm. April 2022: Binance.US raises $200 million in its first funding round, giving it a $4.5 billion valuation. September 2022: Binance announces it will stop supporting the second-largest stablecoin USDC and automatically convert customer funds to BUSD. October 2022: Binance suffers another major hack, and had to briefly halt trading on BNB after a “potential exploit” drained $100 million in crypto. October 2022: Binance confirms it has contributed $500 million towards Elon Musk’s bid to buy Twitter. November 2022: Amidst the collapse of FTX, there was a brief moment when Binance was going to buy the rival exchange. That deal quickly collapsed as the scope of FTX’s issues came to light. December 2022: Binance.US reaches an agreement to buy Voyager Digital\u0027s assets for just over $1 billion. Voyager, had gone into bankruptcy earlier in 2022 and originally had agreed to sell its assets to FTX, which folded itself. February 2023: BUSD issuer Paxos is hit with a one-two punch of an investigation by the New York Department of Financial Services and a Wells Notice from the SEC, which some believed hinted at Binance as a future target for the SEC. Following these actions, Paxos halted minting BUSD. March 2023: The CFTC sues CZ and Binance over allegations that the company offered unregistered crypto derivatives products. April 2023: Rumors of an Interpol “Red Notice” for CZ tank BNB price, but there is little to back up the claim. April 2023: Binance.US pulls out of a $1 billion deal to buy Voyager Digital’s assets, attributing the termination to the \"hostile and uncertain regulatory climate in the United States.\" June 2023: The SEC files charges against Binance.US and its founder Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao on allegations of violating federal securities laws with BNB token and Binance-linked BUSD stablecoin. The suit also alleges that Binance\u0027s staking service violated securities law as well as that the entities of Binance.US and Binance were not truly independent.",

    "title": "Crypto Options Liquidity Provider OrBit Markets Offers Bitcoin and Gold-Hybrid Derivative",
    "detailedContent": "Orbit Markets, an institutional liquidity provider of crypto options, is rolling out the first bitcoin and gold hybrid-focused derivative product with execution broker PI Digital. The initiative is among the latest developments among crypto industry firms to provide steady returns during periods of macroeconomic uncertainty. It aims to give investors exposure to gold and digital assets, two assets that hold their value. “This hybrid asset product is a perfect fit for investors that have experience in traditional assets such as gold and are now starting to dip their toes into digital assets,” OrBit Markets said in a press release. The derivative product, XAUT, is a gold-backed token issued by Tether. At maturity, the product will be settled in either USDT, XAUT or bitcoin as designated by OrBit, the Singapore-based company said. In its statement, OrBit noted that traditional financial service firms (TradFi) commonly offer hybrid products, including those combining stocks and commodity assets. The company said that investors “anticipating a sustained rally” in these two “safe haven” assets have risen amid growing concerns about the U.S. central bank’s hawkish monetary policy and resulting turmoil in the banking sector. “It\u0027s a dual option on both BTC and XAUT,” OrBit said, adding that investors could express “various sophisticated views” on bitcoin and the XAU token, including increases or decreases in returns for both, or if returns for one of the assets climbs but fall for the other. The \"worst-of put option\" allows investors to earn an enhanced yield if both assets appreciate. On the flip side, investors may be \"put\" into the worst performer should either asset fall, the liquidity provider said. In March, DeFi-focused asset management company MEV Capital used OrBit markets-issued options contracts to hedge liquidity providers’ positions and prevent losses in Uniswap (v3) liquidity pools. “OrBit aims to offer flexible solutions to our counterparties,” Pulkit Goyal, OrBit Markets VP of Trading adding that “OrBit plans to launch further hybrid products dedicated to institutional investors.”",

    "summary": "",
    "title": "What Is \u0027Web5\u0027 and How Is it Different From Web3?",
    "detailedContent": "The world is still getting its collective head around Web3 – a suite of decentralized protocols that add a (disputably) censorship-resistant financial layer to the internet. So why did Jack Dorsey, the creator of Web2 platform Twitter, skip right ahead to what he calls \"Web5\"? It turns out that, despite the name, Web5 does not follow the yet-to-be-created Web4. The Web5 platform, announced in June, 2022 by TBD, the crypto and decentralized finance arm of Dorsey’s payments company, Block (née Square), is firmly based on Web3 tech, but promises “an extra decentralized web platform.” To land on the name Web5, TBD just added Web3 (an internet powered by blockchain-based smart contracts) to Web2 (centralized content platforms, like Twitter or Facebook). Put simply: 3 + 2 \u003d 5. Web5’s core idea is to “put you in control of your data and identity” – a core tenet of Web3’s decentralized identity systems. Instead of inviting users to sign up for an account on a centralized platform (like an Instagram account), Web3 protocols reference users by their crypto wallet addresses. Protocols like the Ethereum Name Service let users turn their wallet’s garbled alphanumeric string into a word or phrase (like jane.eth) similar to how Domain Name Service (DNS) allowed websites to have addresses like coindesk.com rather than a long string of numbers like 54.235.191.121. Decentralized data storage is a concept already in existence and is provided by platforms like Filecoin and IPFS. Dorsey’s Web5 offers similar capabilities. Instead of an internet that relies on accounts provided by companies that hold customer data “captive in app silos,” Web5 pushes for “a new class of decentralized apps and protocols that put individuals at the center.” There are three pillars at Web5’s core: self-owned decentralized identifiers, verifiable credentials and decentralized web nodes for storing data and relaying messages. It sounds a lot like what decentralized identity services have been doing since the Ethereum Name Service launched in May 2017. So, what’s new here – apart from yet another stab at decentralized identities? Part of the answer may lie in Dorsey’s allegiance to bitcoin and his aggressive dismissal of Web3 culture. For Dorsey, bitcoin, launched in a truly decentralized fashion in 2009, is the only cryptocurrency that matters, the rest having been corrupted by venture capitalists who bent the platforms to their will. Accordingly, Web5 is run without any “special utility tokens or subjective consensus” that is part of the governance-token, decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)-controlled protocols like the Ethereum Name Service. In doing so, Web5 sounds like an attempt to rid Web3 of the centralized actors that Dorsey credits with sullying the mission of decentralization. Zion, a self-described Web5 app, uses Bitcoin’s base layer to help content creators work together with fans. But avoiding corruption is, of course, difficult: Web5’s nascent community already balked at TBD’s attempt to trademark the term Web5. The other thing that is different from Web3 is that Web5 works with existing Web2 services; it does not seek to replace them entirely. Web5’s pitch deck provides the example of Groove adding a playlist to a Web5 user’s decentralized identifier, which another music service, Tidal, can use to fashion its own playlists within the app. The decentralized identifier prevents the user from having to recreate their preferences on another platform. TBD’s other example of Web5 in action involves one user granting her hotel, airline and rental car provider the ability to add information to her database about her trip. The user can revoke access at any time and choose another service to “help her visualize her itinerary.” Again, the idea is to tie data that’s usually locked inside centralized services – something TBD calls “a massive, unworkable mess” – to a single user-controlled identity. Think of it as similar to how many sites and apps leverage a user’s Google account to log in, but in this case it will be a single login with a decentralized network of nodes. Will it work? Time will tell. So far, the only decentralized identity service that’s caught on in any measure is the Ethereum Name Service, and the only data storage system with any cachet is the interplanetary file service (better known as IPFS). One of the key things that distinguish TBD’s ambition is the backing of its billionaire progenitor, Jack Dorsey. But it’s unclear how Web5 would make money or why, ideological reasons aside, the company is creating such a service. Strategy consultant Adrien Book laid out the problem pretty well in a Medium post that followed Web5’s announcement: “Jack seems to want to keep the taste of Web3 without the calories. It’s like a high school student saying ‘yeah, but communism has never been REALLY tried as it’s meant to be.’ It’s naive.”",

    "title": "What Is DESK? CoinDesk’s Social Token, Explained",
    "detailedContent": "At CoinDesk, we’re not just chronicling the business model transformation that digital assets and the blockchain have made possible – we’re actively participating in it. At Consensus 2021, a virtual event, we beta-tested DESK, an experiment in using tokenized rewards to incentivize engagement and community-building, garnering positive feedback from our audience. At Consensus 2022, CoinDesk relaunched DESK as a full-fledged on-chain social token, making it a core part of the experience at our first live event since 2019. In December 2022, CoinDesk expanded the functionality of DESK to integrate the token into the broader user experience. Now, readers can earn DESK by reading articles, watching videos and more on CoinDesk.com. Read More: DESK Upgrade on CoinDesk’s Website Offers Tokenized Reader Experience Below is everything you need to know about DESK and how to use it. This post will be updated regularly as we build out the DESK program, so check back every so often for the latest information. DESK is CoinDesk’s social token. DESK is designed to build a community around the CoinDesk brand and to reward our audience for engaging with our content. DESK’s ethos is modeled on the founding principles of blockchain technology: openness, community, empowerment and innovation. We hope to use DESK to create a feedback loop with our users to help us build out an ecosystem together. As of this update, you can start earning DESK by creating an account at coindesk.com and engaging with our content, such as reading Consensus Magazine articles. Other ways to earn DESK include: At Consensus 2022, attendees were able to redeem DESK for such rewards as: DESK runs on Polygon, a sidechain, or parallel network, to Ethereum. Polygon helps us provide a gasless experience because of the lower costs per transaction. You’ll need to set up a cryptocurrency wallet that works with Polygon. MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet are the easiest ones to use for beginners. Read more: Get Started With DESK: How to Set Up Your Wallet Yes. With the new release in Dec. 2022, you will be required to have a coindesk.com account. In the Web2 era, content creators – be they writers, artists, filmmakers, publishers, media outlets or event organizers – have become beholden to the algorithms of intermediating platforms, complicating their efforts to directly reach and engage audiences. Simply put, the web ended up replacing one set of gatekeepers (major newspapers, magazines and television networks) with another (social media and search engines). We’re hopeful, like many others, that crypto and Web3 solutions involving tokens and new data and governance models will facilitate a more direct relationship with our audience and the expansion of a community of engaged participants that is independent of the platforms. We believe Consensus, which moves the content creator-audience relationship out of the digital realm and into a physical space where internet gatekeepers have less influence, is a great place to experiment with new tokens and incentive models in pursuit of this goal. We hope DESK generates a community that engages year-round in rich interaction with each other and with CoinDesk articles and other content and then comes back each year to gather in person at this cornerstone annual event. Social tokens allow for community-driven tech by creating a feedback loop between product creators and product users. This will allow the DESK team to get real-time data on engagement based on DESK usage, and use that data to iterate on the DESK ecosystem, aligning it more and more to user needs and wants. Initially, the blockchain provides us with data on DESK usage. The blockchain also discourages insider deals or under-the-table giveaways because the public ledger would lay bare any such misbehavior. This means everyone who claims NFTs or physical rewards had to put in the work (engaging with our content) to earn their reward. Simply put: DESK will be used to align our efforts as a media and events company to the wants and needs of our audience. No. DESK is not a currency, nor is it a financial asset or investment product of any kind. It is not for speculation and will not make anyone rich. This is not a vehicle for anyone’s savings nor is it a money-making opportunity. It is a reward token, analogous to airline frequent-flier miles, hotel guest points and the like. CoinDesk will be taking strong measures to discourage its use for speculation or trading. By providing a system where users can contribute to the functioning of a collective, digital system, the blockchain lays the foundation for a new type of organization: the tokenized community. We\u0027ve seen examples of this over the past few years with NFT communities and distributed autonomous organizations (DAO). To highlight this blockchain use case, we decided to focus on activating and expanding social utility to create community value, instead of focusing on monetization. No. DESK can only be earned as a reward for engaging with CoinDesk events and content, or as a tip from fellow users. No. See above. No. We\u0027re not selling the token at all, just distributing it to audience members as a reward for their engagement. Listing, buying or trading DESK is against our terms of use because we want the rewards and value to come from inside the ecosystem. We reserve the right to ban accounts and blacklist wallet addresses that violate our terms of use. It’s important to remember that not all blockchain assets are fully decentralized or claim to be so. Ether, the native currency of Ethereum, is completely user-controlled, but ERC-20 tokens built on top of the network may or may not be, depending on how the issuer designs it. For example, a number of regulated stablecoins are ERC-20 tokens, and their issuers have the power to freeze funds of suspect addresses to comply with law enforcement requests. So, no, DESK is not decentralized, nor does it purport to be. It is not competing with bitcoin or ether. Part of the value DESK provides is what CoinDesk injects into the ecosystem when we want to reward our users for engaging at a deeper level. This means being able to use your DESK to redeem food and drinks at establishments that CoinDesk partners with on the ground. No. The DESK ecosystem is 100% gasless. CoinDesk is covering the gas costs on Polygon. Because DESK has transitioned from testnet to mainnet, DESK collected in 2021 is no longer usable. That being said, we value the feedback and effort from DESK\u0027s beta testers. Piranhas are the fledgling community that formed around DESK during Consensus 2021. They started their own Discord channel and created memes about the token. The phenomenon was a clear validation for CoinDesk of the concept. At Consensus 2022, the official hub of the DESK community was CoinDesk’s Discord server, where we welcomed the Piranhas and newcomers alike. CoinDesk did, with the help of several key external partners, including Coinvise and others. As mentioned, MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet are easiest to use, but any wallet that works on Polygon can be used. Navigate to the DESK dashboard. Select \"Create or Connect Wallet\" and approve the transaction in your wallet. Depends. CoinDesk can associate identities with wallets only when users create accounts on desk.coindesk.com. We will not use this data for anything other than authenticating users when they sign on or distributing DESK rewards, we will never sell it, and we will protect user information assiduously. (See our privacy policy.) DESK transactions will appear on DESK\u0027s page on the Polyscan block explorer, but only the wallet addresses will be displayed.

    "title": "BlockFi’s Rise and Fall: A Timeline",
    "detailedContent": "Crypto lender BlockFi is kaput. The platform, which offered high yields on crypto deposits, has filed for bankruptcy protection. It’s the latest company to fall after the catastrophic collapse of FTX. Indeed, bankruptcy filings show that BlockFi had $355 million worth of cryptocurrencies frozen in FTX and relied on the firm for its credit facility. But how did it all go so wrong? CoinDesk has compiled a timeline to help you piece together the picture. Zac Prince and Flori Marquez founded BlockFi in October 2017 with a lofty mission: provide credit services to the cryptocurrency market. Prince, the CEO, had worked in sales before founding BlockFi. Marquez, the company’s chief operating officer, managed financial portfolios for Bond Street, a small-time lender that Goldman Sachs acquired in 2017, before founding BlockFi. The firm set up shop in Jersey City, New Jersey, and in subsequent years expanded to New York, Singapore, Poland and Argentina. In January 2018, BlockFi launched its first offering: loans of U.S. dollars backed by cryptocurrencies. Simply, clients could deposit bitcoin (BTC) or ether (ETH) and take out loans in fiat against that crypto collateral. Venture capital money followed swiftly. In February 2018, BlockFi raised $1.55 million in a seed round led by ConsenSys Ventures. In July 2018, it raised a hefty $52.5 million in a funding round led by Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital. And at the end of 2018, BlockFi raised another $4 million by issuing convertible notes, with Akuna Capital the main buyer. Flush with cash, the startup got to work. In March 2019 it launched a crypto deposit account that would reinvest earnings from bitcoin or ether deposits and provide an opportunity to earn compound interest at a 6.2% annual percentage yield (APY). BlockFi adjusted these rates over time; oin May 2019 it almost halved the interest rate on ETH deposits. The risk of the high-interest account, as explained to CoinDesk, was that it \"doesn’t come with the backing of the federal government like a savings account at a bank does.” As the market heated up over the next few years and BlockFi continued to grow, that didn’t seem to hold people back from depositing their money with the company. The firm’s next huge cash injection came in August 2019, when BlockFi raised $18.3 million in a Series A funding round led by Peter Thiel’s Valar Ventures. They were joined by Winklevoss Capital, Galaxy Digital, ConsenSys, Akuna Capital and others. Earlier that year, BlockFi reached a milestone of having over $50 million deposited in its interest-bearing accounts. In December 2019, BlockFi got into the crypto trading game, offering an unusual model that charged zero fees on purchases and sales. Instead of charging trading fees, BlockFi profited by selling trading data to institutional crypto firms that, in turn, provided liquidity to BlockFi, similar to Robinhood’s business model. “Market makers want the information about what trades are happening, and they get it by having relationships with as many venues as they can support to receive that order flow,” BlockFi’s CEO said. Peter Thiel’s Valar Ventures led BlockFi’s $30 million Series B funding round in February 2020, with repeat investors including Akuna Capital and new investors including HashKey Capital, which CEO Prince noted as key to helping “BlockFi expand into Singapore” and the Asia-Pacific region. BlockFi partnered with Silvergate Bank to allow customers to utilize cash deposits via wire transfer to buy bitcoin. Prior to the move, BlockFi was limited to “crypto payment rails” such as stablecoins. Prince said he had been inundated by “requests every day from our existing clients, and also from folks who aren\u0027t already cryptocurrency owners.” The company disclosed the previous month it had $650 million of assets on its platform. All was going well. Then: a hack! In 2020, a single attacker targeted an employee’s phone with a “SIM swap” that tricked the mobile carrier into activating the employee’s phone on another device. This allowed the hacker to gain access to some of BlockFi’s retail marketing systems. No funds were lost, but the attacker managed to access confidential information about BlockFi’s customers. In August 2020, BlockFi raised $50 million in a Series C round led by Morgan Creek Digital. At the time, Zac Prince said the lender held $1.5 billion in assets and made a little under $10 million in revenue each month. National Basketball Association star Matthew Dellavedova was among the investors. In October 2020, BlockFi invested big into Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (Grayscale is owned by CoinDesk\u0027s parent, Digital Currency Group), taking a 5% stake of the $4.8 billion fund. The other big whale invested in GBTC at the time? Hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, which had a 6% stake as of June 2020. BlockFi continued to expand its stake in GBTC, to $1.7 billion in GBTC by February 2021. Unfortunately, it later turned out that it was difficult to get money out of GBTC. In addition, as of writing, shares in the trust trade at a huge discount to bitcoin. Early in 2021, BlockFi registered its own Bitcoin Trust with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, putting it in direct competition with Grayscale’s product. The fund offered a lower management fee and partnered with Fidelity Digital Asset Services to custody the assets. In November of that same year, it filed for approval for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund. All was going well for BlockFi. With bitcoin’s soaring price hitting all-time highs (bitcoin crossed the $60,000 mark for the first time in March 2021), BlockFi raised $350 million, giving the company a valuation of $3 billion. It held $15 billion in assets and aimed to increase its staff to 500 people by the end of the year. It said it had 225,000 users, up from 10,000 in late 2019. What could go wrong? New Jersey’s Bureau of Securities was the first to deliver a big blow. The state’s financial regulator claimed BlockFi’s interest accounts amounted to sales of an “unregistered security” and issued a ban on creating new interest-bearing accounts. Alabama issued its own notice to the lender shortly after, and Texas joined on the same day. Two days later, Vermont lodged its complaint, and at the end of the month Kentucky ordered the lender to stop signing up new interest account customers. The CEO called on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to look into the matter. So the national securities regulator did exactly that – and it didn’t end well for BlockFi (we’ll get to that next). It was poor timing for BlockFi, which was looking to raise $500 million in a Series E and was launching a Visa rewards credit card. In February, BlockFi settled with the SEC for $100 million over its high-yield lending product. It registered with the SEC, but from mid-February stopped offering the interest account to new clients in the U.S., and prevented existing U.S. clients from adding more money to their accounts. “Today’s settlement makes clear that crypto markets must comply with time-tested securities laws,” SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a statement. In June, BlockFi’s valuation sank to $1 billion in a “down round” – a third of its $3 billion valuation the previous March, when it raised $350 million. At the end of June, the lender held $1.8 billion in open loans and $600 million of exposure. In particular, BlockFi had made huge loans to the huge crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, which officially filed for bankruptcy protection on July 1. Three Arrows had failed after being overexposed to the collapsed stablecoin ecosystem, Terra; BlockFi, according to reports, had liquidated the hedge fund\u0027s collateral before its bankruptcy. In the same month, bitcoin fell below $20,000. A month later, BlockFi’s main rivals, Voyager Digital and Celsius Network, also filed for bankruptcy protection. In dire straits, BlockFi received a $400 million line of credit from crypto exchange FTX later that summer. The exchange also won the right for its U.S. unit to buy BlockFi FTX US almost bought the lender for just $25 million, and in August could have bought the company for as little as $15 million if certain key terms weren’t met, such as receiving SEC clearance to operate its yield-generating services in the U.S. At the start of the month, FTX itself collapsed after CoinDesk published a story based on private financial documents on Nov. 2 that poked holes in the balance sheet of FTX sister company, trading firm Alameda Research. It took only nine more days for FTX to completely melt down, and it went to bankruptcy court on Nov. 11. That was bad for BlockFi, which needed FTX’s credit facility to remain afloat. Late on Nov. 10, BlockFi paused customer withdrawals amid “the lack of clarity” about FTX. On Nov. 11, California’s financial regulator revoked BlockFi’s lending license. BlockFi started preparing for its bankruptcy filing shortly after that. On Nov. 28, it officially filed for protection under Chapter 11, leaving over 100,000 creditors in the lurch. Filings later revealed that Alameda had defaulted on $680 million worth of loans to BlockFi. After filing in the bankruptcy court, BlockFi sued Sam Bankman-Fried\u0027s Emergent Fidelity Technologies for its Robinhood shares, which were pledged to BlockFi as collateral for a loan. In the first bankruptcy hearing, lawyers for BlockFi said the lender held $355 million in crypto on FTX. All the while, one question looms: Will customers get anything back?

    "title": "What Are \u0027Fully Backed\u0027 Reserves?",
    "detailedContent": "Regular banks do not actually hold all of your money. They lend out most of your deposits in an attempt to eke out returns from financial markets. This works, for the most part, because the bank insures deposits with the federal government and because the bank widely diversifies its exposure to risk to ensure that it won’t be caught short in the event of a financial crash. This system occasionally fails in traditional finance (see: Lehman) but fails frequently in crypto. The government does not insure deposits to crypto platforms and the platforms often do not manage risk particularly well (see: FTX, Voyager Digital, Celsius Network), making high-risk bets that end in catastrophe. Read More: Proof of Reserves: Could it Have Prevented the FTX Meltdown? After so many platforms squandered customer funds, crypto traders are thinking twice about depositing funds to crypto exchanges and lending institutions that “rehypothecate” uninsured deposits – which means they repurpose customer money and lend the funds out in the markets. A safer bet looks like trading on platforms that “fully back” their reserves. But what does this really mean, and should such claims be taken with a pinch of salt? When a financial product, such as a stablecoin or depositary institution, claims to “fully back” its reserves, it means that it has stored enough money behind a product, like a stablecoin or a customer’s trading account, to support its worth. So, a crypto exchange that “fully backs” its reserves should always be able to pay out customer withdrawals, no matter the state of the market. One such example is Coinbase, which does not lend out its customers’ funds without their express permission, meaning it should always have enough money on hand to prevent a bank run. A stablecoin that “fully backs” its reserves is always able to fulfill conversions to the original asset, no matter what. One example is wBTC, or wrapped bitcoin, which holds real bitcoin (BTC) in a cold wallet, then issues an equal amount of an Ethereum-based version of the coin that trades as an ERC-20 token. Fully backed, however, does not necessarily mean that assets are held one to one. That claim refers to the idea that if you, say, give me a dollar, I’ll hold that dollar as a dollar and won’t turn it into something else. Lots of stablecoins that claim to be fully backed, like U.S.-dollar stablecoin USDC, are not backed one to one. This is because the companies that issue USDC hold the deposits of real U.S. dollars in “cash and cash equivalents.” Cash equivalents refer to U.S. Treasury bonds, which is debt issued by the U.S. Treasury Department. These bonds, which pay small returns to holders over time, are close enough to the worth of actual U.S. dollars that the market accepts bonds being essentially worth the same. But “fully backed” does not always mean that the backing can withstand financial shocks. U.S. dollar stablecoin tether (USDT) also claims that its reserves are fully backed, but this backing is secured by “other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether [the issuing company] to third parties.” So, USDT may be fully backed, but it is partially backed by loans to other crypto companies. Until October 2022, USDT was also backed by commercial paper – short-term commercial debt to other companies – and moved those funds to U.S. Treasurys. The concern about the commercial paper was that nobody knew which companies Tether was using to back USDT, so it was impossible to determine the worth of that backing. What’s more, its “fully backed” claim has historically turned out not to be true after it emerged in 2019 that USDT was, at one point, only 74% backed. As wrote the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u0027s Dawn D. Stump, the claim that it was backed to the U.S. dollar was “not 100% true, 100% of the time.” Read more: What Is Tether? How USDT Works and What Backs Its Value Some stablecoins do not fully back their reserves, which has led to catastrophic results in some cases. The popular algorithmic stablecoin UST, for instance, crashed in spectacular fashion, wiping billions from the market. On the opposite end of the spectrum, U.S. dollar stablecoin DAI overcollateralizes its reserves with crypto, meaning it has more than enough crypto on hand to back its coin. DAI has survived several market crashes. ",

    "detailedContent": "The exchanges that want to list and trade shares of spot ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds are abruptly being asked by regulators to update key filings related to these products. Exchanges are being asked to update 19b-4 filings on an accelerated basis by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, three people familiar with the situation told CoinDesk, suggesting they may be moving to approve these applications ahead of a key deadline this Thursday. That doesn\u0027t mean the ETFs will be authorized, though. Would-be issuers also need their S-1 applications approved before the products could begin trading. SEC could take an indefinite amount of time to approve the S-1 documents, one person familiar with the matter said, as it isn\u0027t tied to a deadline. One company in talks with the SEC said it feels like it might be on the right track for approval, in a turnaround from feeling some weeks ago that the SEC was dragging its feet, according to a person familiar with the matter. Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart raised their odds for the approval of a spot ether ETF to 75% from 25% on Monday after hearing chatter that the SEC could be taking a more favorable stance towards the applications. They later corrected their statement, saying that the odds were related to the 19b-4 approvals. The SEC is expected to make a decision on VanEck spot ether ETF on May 23rd. The SEC has been investigating whether ether, the chief native asset to the Ethereum blockchain, is a security, launching a formal inquiry after the network moved from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake mechanism. If ether is deemed to be a security by the SEC, that may be one reason for the regulator to reject the spot ether ETF applications. One test of the agency\u0027s view on whether ETH is a security has newly emerged at Prometheum. The special purpose broker announced Monday it had soft-launched its ether custody service. The company eventually intends to launch custody and trading services for other digital assets – importantly, assets that are treated as securities in the U.S., not commodities.

    "detailedContent": "A Monday rally during the U.S. trading day put an end to what had been very muted crypto price action over the previous 72 hours, pushing bitcoin (BTC) above $68,000 for the first time in more than five weeks. At press time, the world\u0027s largest crypto was changing hands at $68,250. Leading the rally in crypto was Solana\u0027s (SOL), which has gained 7% over the past 24 hours, also to more than a five-week high. That outperformed both bitcoin\u0027s 2.6% advance and the CoinDesk 20\u0027s 2.8% rise. Read more: Solana\u0027s SOL Could Hit $200 By Month End, Hedge Fund Founder Says The turnaround in the recent downward price action came last week after the government reported softer-than-forecast April inflation data and quarterly institutional filings showed interesting participation in the spot bitcoin ETFs from the Wisconsin state pension board and a number of heavy-hitting hedge funds. Bitcoin rallied from just above the $60,000 to more than $66,000 by week\u0027s end. Alongside that rally came a renewal of big inflows into the spot bitcoin ETFs, which had previously witnessed net outflows over four of the previous seven weeks. All told, the spot funds added 14,389 bitcoin last week, according to HODL Capital, the strongest performance since March. Earlier Friday, Grayscale, the manager of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), announced the exit of CEO Michael Sonnenshein, who will be replaced by Goldman Sachs executive Peter Mintzberg. The move suggests Grayscale may have its eyes on a return to growing assets for GBTC as opposed to the current slow bleed of bitcoin from its holdings.",

    "title": "Will RFK Jr. Debate Trump or Biden? Probably Not, Prediction Market Says",
    "detailedContent": "This week in prediction markets… A presidential debate that includes independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. alongside President Biden or Republican frontrunner Donald Trump is unlikely to happen, bettors on crypto-based predictions platform Polymarket are signaling. \"Yes\" shares in the contract are trading at 27 cents, meaning the market sees a 27% chance of it occurring. Each share pays out $1 if the prediction comes true, and zero if not. The machinations of the American political-industrial complex make it difficult for a third party, or independent candidate, to succeed. Ballot access laws favor major parties, creating significant barriers for third-party candidates. Getting on a debate stage has another high threshold of its own. Rules for the first debate, scheduled for June 27 on CNN, say that the candidates must appear on enough state ballots to hypothetically reach 270 electoral votes, and also receive 15% in four polls. A second debate on ABC is scheduled for September, and it also has a 15% polling rule. Currently, RFK Jr. is polling at just under 10% in national polls compiled by 270toWin. Right now his team says they have confirmed ballot access, or are working on it, in enough states to win 201 electoral votes, which is enough to be a spoiler, but not to win the presidency. But independent candidates have participated in the debates in living memory: in 1992, independent candidate H. Ross Perot appeared on stage alongside George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton. To be clear, the Polymarket contract says that RFK Jr. must participate in a debate including Trump or Biden. It doesn\u0027t say that the debate must be an official one. Trump\u0027s campaign wants more debates, according to reports, proposing one per month from June to September, preferring two-hour stand-up debates in larger venues with live audiences. The current train of thought holds that RFK Jr.\u0027s campaign is more of a threat to Biden than Trump\u0027s, and polls that include him give Trump a slight edge, up to 5 points in some. It\u0027s plausible that the Trump campaign could decide to host a streaming debate with the Kennedy campaign, or hold it on a lesser-known network like OANN. It just needs to be a \"publicly broadcast debate\" per Polymarket\u0027s rules. (Don\u0027t forget that Kennedy is coming to CoinDesk\u0027s Consensus conference, taking the stage on May 31 at 4:30 PM) Sora, OpenAI\u0027s text-to-video generator, wowed the world when Sam Altman\u0027s company demoed the project back in February. Missing is a launch date. Bettors on Kalshi, a U.S.-regulated platform, are predicting that launch will take place sometime between September and the end of 2025, with only a 27% chance it will occur before September. But there\u0027s one thing that\u0027s getting in the way of a wide release of Sora: the availability of high-end graphics processing units (GPUs). Rendering video from text prompts is going to take a lot of them, more, in fact, than many of the world\u0027s largest customers of Nvidia have in their data centers. According to a report by Factorial Funds, OpenAI\u0027s Sora faces significant challenges regarding GPU availability, as mainstream adoption of text-to-video generation would require hundreds of thousands of server-grade GPUs at a cost of tens of billions. Factorial estimates that supporting the creator community of platforms like TikTok and YouTube alone would necessitate around 720,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs, far exceeding the combined resources of major tech companies like Microsoft, Meta, and Google. But remember, the contract isn\u0027t asking if Sora will be widely available. A launch with limited availability and a high monthly cost would still count. It\u0027s just asking if it will launch. Punters on Polymarket aren’t expecting any of the best-known cat meme coins to become the first such token to reach the $1 billion market cap milestone. A market capitalization bet for cat-themed tokens, which some expect to flip their dog-themed counterparts in the next bull cycle, has racked up $1.2 million in bets since going live in March. As of Monday, popular tokens Popcat (POPCAT) and cat in a dogs world (MEW) have 22% and 7% odds, while shark cat (SC) and toshi (TOSHI) have odds of under 2%. Despite all these memes being valued at over $200 million and occupying massive mindshare in the meme coin community, punters aren’t expecting any of these to become the first billion-dollar cat meme. Instead, the “others/none in 2024” category dominates the odds at 68%. Other cat-themed tokens in the open market but not referenced in the Polymarket contract are mog (MOG), wen (WEN) and maneki (MANEKI), according to CoinGecko. The high odds for two distinct outcomes suggest traders either expect a whole other cat meme to become the biggest or expect no single token in the category to get such a rich valuation. The apparent bearish sentiment is likely not due to the lack of buying pressure, either. Two dog tokens, bonk (BONK), dogwifhat (WIF), and the frog-themed pepe (PEPE), were launched in 2023 and zoomed to over $3 billion each in less than a year, showcasing the demand for such tokens. Among meme coin hunters, the perceived cuteness of a meme drives its virality and, ultimately, price. So which is cuter: a dog with a pink beanie hat or a cat with a mouth that pops? The punters have decided. A market betting on Solana fees flipping those of Ethereum has fallen 12 points in the past week, after jumping up to 35% earlier in the month. The “Solana flips ETH in daily fees in May?” market, which has seen over $60,000 in wagers placed, is a market on whether the daily fees of Solana (SOL) will surpass that of Ethereum (ETH) for any day within this market’s time frame from May 10 to May 31. Odds of the flip rose earlier this month due to a revival of meme coin trading as GameStop stock prices surged higher, aiding growth in meme tokens. However, the odds fell following a $2 million exploit on Pump.Fun, a tool that lets anyone deploy a tradeable token on Solana. The brief exploit may have been expected by some to slow the rapid issuance of meme coins on Solana, which would in turn depress daily fees. Despite being extremely cheap compared to Ethereum, the Solana blockchain collects millions of dollars in fees every day thanks to the sheer magnitude of meme coin trading activity on the network. Still, the fee difference isn’t a big one. Blockchain activity on Ethereum netted it over $1.84 million in the past 24 hours, while it was nearly $1.2 million for Solana, DefiLlama data shows. Pump.Fun has since come back online, and is seeing thousands of new memes launched daily as usual. Peruse it at your risk.",

    "detailedContent": "The exchanges that want to list and trade shares of spot ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds are abruptly being asked by regulators to update key filings related to these products. Exchanges are being asked to update 19b-4 filings on an accelerated basis by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, three people familiar with the situation told CoinDesk, suggesting they may be moving to approve these applications ahead of a key deadline this Thursday. That doesn\u0027t mean the ETFs will be authorized, though. Would-be issuers also need their S-1 applications approved before the products could begin trading. SEC could take an indefinite amount of time to approve the S-1 documents, one person familiar with the matter said, as it isn\u0027t tied to a deadline. One company in talks with the SEC said it feels like it might be on the right track for approval, in a turnaround from feeling some weeks ago that the SEC was dragging its feet, according to a person familiar with the matter. Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart raised their odds for the approval of a spot ether ETF to 75% from 25% on Monday after hearing chatter that the SEC could be taking a more favorable stance towards the applications. They later corrected their statement, saying that the odds were related to the 19b-4 approvals. The SEC is expected to make a decision on VanEck spot ether ETF on May 23rd. The SEC has been investigating whether ether, the chief native asset to the Ethereum blockchain, is a security, launching a formal inquiry after the network moved from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake mechanism. If ether is deemed to be a security by the SEC, that may be one reason for the regulator to reject the spot ether ETF applications. One test of the agency\u0027s view on whether ETH is a security has newly emerged at Prometheum. The special purpose broker announced Monday it had soft-launched its ether custody service. The company eventually intends to launch custody and trading services for other digital assets – importantly, assets that are treated as securities in the U.S., not commodities.

    "detailedContent": "Michael Sonnenshein, CEO of digital asset investment firm Grayscale, has stepped down after 10 years to be replaced by a veteran from the world of traditional finance (TradFi) world just months after the company\u0027s flagship Bitcoin Trust became an exchange-traded fund (ETF). Sonnenshein, who became CEO in 2021, will be replaced by Peter Mintzberg, head of strategy for asset and wealth management at Goldman Sachs on Aug. 15, Grayscale said on Monday. Mintzberg has more than 20 years of experience in TradFi, having previously worked at BlackRock, OppenheimerFunds and Invesco. CFO Edward McGee will lead the company on an interim basis until Mintzberg fills the role. \"Michael guided the firm through exponential growth \u0026 oversaw its pivotal role in bringing spot bitcoin ETFs to market, leading the way for the broader financial industry,\" Barry Silbert, CEO of Grayscale\u0027s parent company Digital Currency Group, wrote on X. In January, Grayscale was one of about a dozen firms to finally have a spot bitcoin ETF approved to list in the U.S. in January. The firm had taken the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to court over the regulator\u0027s repeated refusal to allow it to convert its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), then a closed-end fund, into an ETF. GBTC saw around $15 billion of outflows in the following three months as the firm kept fees higher than its competitors.

    "title": "How MIT Brothers Allegedly Cheated a Noxious-But-Accepted Ethereum Practice for $25M",
    "detailedContent": "They had it all planned out. In late 2022, the brothers Peraire-Bueno – twenty-something graduates of Massachusetts Institute of Technology who had turned their sights on blockchain – embarked on an effort that ultimately netted them $25 million, in one of the most sophisticated exploits in a decade or so of frequent crypto exploits. At the outset, according to U.S. prosecutors, they outlined a four-step plan. First there was \"The Bait.\" Then there was \"Unblinding the block,\" followed by \"The Search,\" and ultimately \"The Propagation.\" \"In the months that followed, the defendants followed each stage as outlined in their Exploit Plan,\" according to an indictment. The U.S. Department of Justice on Wednesday charged two brothers, Anton Peraire-Bueno, 24, and James Peraire-Bueno, 28, for exploiting a vulnerability in a popular software program used by trading bots on the Ethereum blockchain, netting an estimated $25 million of gains during a 12-second exploit in April 2023. Their father is Jaime Peraire, the former head of MIT\u0027s department of aeronautics and astronautics, CNBC reported. The exploit happened thanks to a vulnerability that the brothers discovered in MEV-boost, a piece of software used by roughly 90% of the validators that run the blockchain, allowing them to see the transactions in blocks before they were officially sent off to validators. MEV, or maximal extractable value, is sometimes known as an “invisible tax” that validators and builders can collect from users by reordering or inserting transactions in a block before they’re added to the blockchain. Sometimes the practice is compared with frontrunning in traditional stock markets, but due to the difficulty of eradicating it completely, the Ethereum community has more or less accepted the practice, and simply tried to minimize the deleterious effects. One of those mitigating strategies is through the use of MEV-Boost, a software program used by roughly 90% of Ethereum validators. The idea is that all comers could earn MEV more equitably. Such a this-is-just-how-it\u0027s-done attitude was explicitly acknowledged by the prosecutors in their charging document. \"Tampering with these established MEV-Boost proposals, which are relied upon by the vast majority of Ethereum users, threatens the stability and integrity of the Ethereum blockchain for all network participants,\" according to the indictment. On Ethereum, users submit transactions that are added to a \"mempool” – an area where transactions are in a holding pattern. MEV-boost lets \"block builders\" assemble those mempool transactions from the mempool and put them into blocks. Then, MEV bots, or \"searchers,” look into the mempool and assess which transactions could make profitable trades, and sometimes bribe those block builders to rearrange or insert certain transactions to squeeze out some extra profits. Ethereum validators then take those blocks from MEV-boost and ink them to the chain, where they become irreversible. All these steps are typically executed automatically by the software in fractions of seconds. What the Peraire-Bueno brothers did in this case was target three MEV bots who didn’t have certain checks in place, and set up 16 validators designed to entice the bots. When the searchers bundle transactions together, they have a target transaction, a signed transaction before it, and a signed transaction after. “The rules of the game are, ‘Well, I give you this bundle, and the bundle has to execute atomically,’ meaning it will only go if all three transactions are included in exactly this order, and any other thing than that, it\u0027s not going to work,” Matt Cutler, the CEO of Blocknative, a blockchain infrastructure firm, told CoinDesk in an interview. Because the brothers set up malicious validators, their intent was always to seize on the opportunity to exploit the bots that did not have those checks, by pulling apart those transactions. “Because the honeypot transactions were very lucrative, and the bots didn\u0027t have checks in place to prevent certain conditions from happening, and they fundamentally trusted the integrity of the validator and MEV-boost ecosystem, the malicious validator got access to signed transactions that were secured and they were then able to manipulate those signed transactions to drain the bots of $25 million of funds,” Cutler said. In its allegations, the government went out of its way to demonstrate that the activities – targeting a crucial juncture of the blockchain\u0027s inner workings, at a level that\u0027s technical even for experienced blockchain developers – diverged from the community norms, and into the realm of fraud. Specifically, the brothers were accused of sending a \"false signature\" in lieu of a valid digital signature to a crucial player in the chain known as a \"relay.\" A signature is needed to reveal the contents of a proposed block of transactions – including all of the potential profits contained inside the bundle. \"In this process, a relay acts in a manner similar to an escrow account, which temporarily maintains the otherwise private transaction data of the proposed block until the validator commits to publishing the block to the blockchain exactly as ordered,\" the prosecutors wrote. \"The relay will not release the transactions within the proposed block to the validator until the validator has confirmed through a digital signature that it will publish the proposed block, as structured by the builder, to the blockchain.\" Based on their research and planning, the prosecutors alleged, the brothers \"knew that the information contained in the false signature was designed to, and did, trick the Relay to prematurely release the full content of the proposed block to the defendants, including the private transaction information,\" according to the indictment. As Cutler put it, “Stealing is stealing, regardless of the terms that enable that stealing.” “Just because your car door is unlocked, doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s okay to break into your car, right?” he said. Ethereum is often susceptible to some controversial MEV trading practices, like front-running and so-called sandwich attacks. But many leading figures in the MEV ecosystem view the exploit that took place last year as pure theft. Taylor Monahan, a lead product manager at MetaMask, wrote on X that “Yes, if you steal and launder $25 million dollars you should expect to go to prison for a long time lmfao.” “It’s a little bit robbing the robbers you could arguably say, but regardless it was clearly an exploit, a manipulation of rule sets, in a manner that is seen to be in violation of established laws of the jurisdiction, right,” Cutler said. Almost to underscore the point, the government alleged that in the weeks following the exploit, Anton Peraire-Bueno \"searched online for, among other things, \u0027top crypto lawyers,\u0027 \u0027how long is us statue [sic] of limitations,\u0027 \u0027wire fraud statute / wire fraud statute [sic] of limitations,\u0027 \u0027fraudulent Ethereum addresses database\u0027 and \u0027money laundering statue [sic] of limitations.\u0027\" The prosecution also noted that the day after the exploit, James Peraire-Bueno emailed a bank representative asking “for a safe deposit box that was large enough to fit a laptop.” Read more: Brothers Accused of $25M Ethereum Exploit as U.S. Reveals Fraud Charges",

    "title": "The Protocol: Lido Backers vs EigenLayer",
    "detailedContent": "I must admit to choking on my tequila drink a couple weeks ago after hearing the phrase \"investable asset class\" applied to the category of digital tokens known as meme coins. But for many investors and projects, the opportunity is being taken quite seriously. See our riff below. ALSO: This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Also please check out our weekly The Protocol podcast. MEME RUSH! An industry source told me over margaritas a few weeks ago, \"You\u0027re starting to hear venture capital firms make the argument that meme coins are becoming an investable asset class.\" What\u0027s undeniable is that meme coins are popping, and there does appear to be a thriving industry in promoting them. In April alone, CoinMarketCap added 138 meme coins to its listings, versus 18 in the same month a year earlier, bringing the total to 2,229, with a market capitalization of more than $50 billion, as reported by our Omkar Godbole. Last week, VanEck, a crypto-friendly institutional investment firm, started a new Meme Coin Index, tracking prices of doggy-themed tokens dogecoin (DOGE) and dogwifhat (WIF) as well as other ridiculousness like BONK. Another dog token, FLOKI, shared the title sponsorship for a cricket series between Pakistan and Ireland. Crypto analysts are talking up the election-related meme coins TRUMP and BODEN, and tokens associated with the X-Men character Wolverine flooded several blockchains after TheRoaringKitty, the personality behind the GameStop meme stock frenzy, posted a related video on X. Even independent Bitcoin programmer Jimmy Song, often a vocal critic of non-Bitcoin token creation, wrote in a Substack post that he appreciated the \"honesty\" of the movement: \"Meme coins obsoleted the VCs and ultimately brought some more honesty to the Nietzschean will-to-power games that were always being played.\" Speaking of Bitcoin, the OG blockchain now has meme coins too, many of them created with the Runes protocol launched last month. Sovryn, a decentralized trading platform with Ethereum-compatible smart contracts and secured by Bitcoin through merge-mining on the Rootstock sidechain, announced Wednesday that it has created a fully-premined rune called POWA, airdropped the tokens to users and established pools for trading them. \"Runes provide a way for projects to create and distribute tokens natively on the Bitcoin blockchain for memes,\" Sovryn said in a press release. STAKERS NOW RESTAKERS? Our Sam Kessler has the scoop: \"The co-founders of Lido, the biggest liquid staking protocol on Ethereum, are secretly funding a competitor to EigenLayer, the buzzy \"restaking\" service that has emerged rapidly this year to become a powerful force in decentralized finance. According to several people with knowledge of the matter, the project is called Symbiotic and has drawn backing from not only the Lido co-founders, Konstantin Lomashuk and Vasiliy Shapovalov, through their venture firm Cyber Fund, but also Paradigm, the crypto venture capital firm that is one of Lido\u0027s lead investors. CoinDesk also obtained internal Symbiotic documents that describe the project, which allows users to \"restake\" using Lido\u0027s staked ether (stETH) token and other popular assets that are not natively compatible with EigenLayer.\" JUST IN: Two brothers have been arrested by the U.S. Department of Justice for attacking the Ethereum blockchain and stealing $25 million of cryptocurrency during a 12-second exploit, according to an indictment unsealed on Wednesday. THE WORDS OF VITALIK. We\u0027ve written quite a bit in The Protocol newsletter about just how prolific (and prolix) the Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin can be as a writer. It\u0027s also true that when he writes, people tend to write a lot about whatever he writes – such as this opus on \"multidimensional gas pricing,\" which Decrypt covered. But apparently Buterin is also crazy fast as a scribbler, especially when it comes to banging out Ethereum improvement proposals on deadline, as chronicled on Tuesday by our Margaux Nijkerk. With time ticking down toward an important meeting to discuss new Ethereum wallet standards, it took Buterin just 22 minutes to draft EIP-7702, offered as a substitute for an earlier proposal, EIP-3074, that had drawn complaints from some developers. The hot-off-the-press publication drew plaudits from critics, with much of the Ethereum community quickly coming around in support of replacing the earlier effort with Buterin\u0027s proposed solution. The courtroom where Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev was sentenced. (Camomile Shumba/CoinDesk) Alexey Pertsev, 31, a developer of the coin mixer Tornado Cash, has been found guilty of money laundering by a Dutch judge, and was given 64 months of prison time. The case, along with other recent actions brought by prosecutors around the world, has raised questions about the extent of responsibility that developers might bear for any code they write. As reported by our Camomile Shumba, prosecutors in the Dutch case made the argument that Pertsev \"should have at least suspected the criminal origins of illicit transactions on the Tornado Cash platform.\" Solana-based crypto trading protocol Cypher has endured its share of hacks and heists. But its latest loss was an inside job. On Tuesday, a pseudonymous developer known as Hoak admitted to stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of cryptocurrencies from Cypher\u0027s hack reimbursement fund. \"I took the funds and gambled them away,\" Hoak said in a statement, blaming his activity on a \"crippling gambling addiction.\" El Salvador set up a new website to track its $350 million bitcoin stockpile, Bitcoin Magazine reported. Degen Chain, an Ethereum layer-3 blockchain dedicated to meme coins, came back online after a two-day outage. (Launched in March, Degen Chain is an \"an ultra-low-cost L3 for the Degen community built with Arbitrum Orbit, Base for settlement, and AnyTrust for data availability,\" according to a blog post at the time by Syndicate, the blockchain\u0027s infrastructure partner.) ICYMI: CoinDesk\u0027s Danny Nelson takes a look inside the shadowy world of crypto influencers known as \"key opinion leaders,\" or KOLs, who invest in the projects they promote on social media – in return for the privilege of selling out before other investors. Top picks of the past week from our Protocol Village column, highlighting key blockchain tech upgrades and news. Hyperbolic\u0027s Proof of Sampling architecture (Zhang et al) 1. Hyperbolic, the two-year-old startup that math olympian Jasper Zhang leads focused on decentralized AI computing, said Thursday that it is introducing a protocol called “Proof of Sampling (PoSP),” aimed at addressing challenges with trust in decentralized AI networks. Hyperbolic was co-founded in 2022 by Zhang and Yuchen Jin, who holds a Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Washington. 2. Lens Lab, a part of the Stani Kulechov-led Avara and the team behind Lens Protocol, a Web3 social platform built on Polygon PoS, announced that it is now developing its own blockchain network, Lens Network. The new network will be built on Matter Labs\u0027 ZK Stack, powered by zkSync on Ethereum. \"The Lens Network will set a new baseline/precedent for how social networks should be built,\" Alex Gluchowski, co-founder and CEO of Matter Labs, said in a press release. 3. Polkadot, the layer-1 chain ecosystem co-founded by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, has debuted Asynchronous Backing, according to the team: It sets the stage for Polkadot 2.0, \"a wave of enhancements expected to significantly improve the scalability, cost, speed and flexibility of the network, and accelerate growth of decentralized applications,\" according to the team. \"Asynchronous Backing cuts block time in half (from 12 to 6 seconds) enables parallel transaction validation block production, and delivers up to 10x higher throughput for Polkadot\u0027s parachain consensus protocol.\" 4. Indian crypto exchange CoinDCX has expanded what started as the Okto wallet into an Okto ecosystem, which will include launching a blockchain, a token, and a points program starting Tuesday. The aim is to give global users a single-click mobile experience while traversing the Web3 space, its co-founders Neeraj Khandelwal and Sumit Gupta told CoinDesk in an interview. 5. Cyber, the just-unveiled rebranding for the developer formerly known as CyberConnect, has launched its own layer-2 network in the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem, describing it as the \"first L2 for social.\" According to the team, the new chain relies on \"top modular solutions. Cyber integrates Optimism’s OP Stack, EigenDA and custom features to provide low fees, high TPS and a user-friendly experience.\" According to a blog post: \"AltLayer will manage the rollup’s technical launch, ongoing management, operations and future upgrades.\" EasyA Consensus Hackathon - Call for Participants This year, Consensus is hosting its first ever in-person hackathon together with the world\u0027s number 1 Web3 learning app, EasyA.

We have a few remaining spots left for hackers, so if you\u0027re excited about participating, make sure you sign up here! Avalanche Incubator Colony Lab Co-founders Wessal Erradi and Elie Le Rest (Colony Lab) Even in anything-goes crypto trading, there are conventions designed to protect the little guy. One of those is the vesting period – a window of time following a digital-token sale or airdrop where early investors, such as founders, project contributors and venture-capital backers, are locked up from dumping their allocations. Projects typically do this so that the price of that token doesn’t crash immediately after a listing, say if big stakeholders were to sell right away. Another goal is to make sure insiders and early backers keep skin in the game, an assurance of good faith, as it were. Now comes a new feature from Colony Lab, a developer and project incubator in the Avalanche blockchain ecosystem, called \"liquid vesting.\" If it sounds like a workaround, that\u0027s because it basically is. Have your bags and keep them too. Take liquidity now, without having to wait for the end of the vesting period. Click here for the full article by CoinDesk\u0027s Margaux Nijkerk Fundraisings Data and Tokens We covered last month\u0027s launch of the Runes protocol atop Bitcoin, observing in real time as its instant popularity and uptake right after the bitcoin halving sent transaction fees to record levels, as users scrambled to mint new meme coins, competing to get transactions included in the suddenly-congested blockchain. (As a plug: I\u0027m scheduled to interview Rodarmor onstage on May 31 at CoinDesk\u0027s Consensus conference in Austin.) Even as recently as last week, Runes accounted for a majority of all transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain, outpacing the original bitcoin as well as Ordinals inscriptions and the rival fungible-token standard BRC-20. But the Runes frenzy has now faded somewhat. Runes has been \"written off as a flop, with waning interest failing to match the hype,\" according to a report by the blockchain analysis firm Coin Metrics. The analysts noted, however, that there may still be hope for a resurgence: \"Runes are yet to be validated in the form of listings on major exchanges, trading largely on niche collectibles platforms.\" Transactions related to the new protocol appear to be ticking down: Runes transactions of all types have shrunk since the launch around April 20.

    "title": "Alleged Owner of Darknet Narcotics Bazaar ‘Incognito Market’ Arrested in New York",
    "detailedContent": "U.S. authorities have arrested and charged a Taiwanese national with operating darknet drug bazaar Incognito Market, which he allegedly used to facilitate over $100 million in crypto-denominated sales of illegal narcotics including fentanyl. Prosecutors say Rui-Siang Lin, 23, operated Incognito Market under the pseudonym “Pharoah” and oversaw all of its operations, including employees, vendors and customers, and had “ultimate decision-making authority over every aspect of the multimillion-dollar operation” from its formation in October 2020 to its shutdown in March this year. “The dedicated prosecutors from the Southern District of New York and our law enforcement partners will pursue criminal actors regardless of whether they operate on street corners or in the dark corners of the internet,” said U.S. Attorney Damian Williams in a Monday statement. “The so-called ‘dark web’ is not a safe haven for those who seek to break the law.” Lin was arrested at New York’s John F. Kennedy Airport on Saturday and will be presented in front of a Southern District of New York (SDNY) magistrate judge today. He faces one count of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, one count of narcotics conspiracy, one count of money laundering, and one count of conspiracy to sell adulterated and misbranded medication. The first charge – sometimes called the “kingpin statute” – carries a mandatory minimum sentence of life in prison. Ross Ulbricht, the creator and operator of the now-shuttered Silk Road darknet drug marketplace, was found guilty of the same crime and sentenced to life in prison. The narcotics conspiracy charge carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years and a maximum potential sentence of life in prison. The other two charges carry a combined maximum of 25 years in prison. Lin allegedly made millions from operating Incognito Market, which took a 5% cut of every sale. The darknet market had its own “bank,” prosecutors said, which gave users an additional layer of anonymity by allowing them to deposit cryptocurrency into their own accounts, which the site then automatically transferred from buyers to sellers, minus the fee. According to the complaint, Lin created and operated Incognito Market while an undergraduate student at the prestigious National Taiwan University. In March, Incognito Market shut down after reportedly pulling an exit scam that left users unable to withdraw their funds. Administrators of the site then reportedly began extorting vendors, ordering them to pay a fee ranging from $100 to $20,000, depending on their size, or else risk having their customers’ data leaked. Lin, a self-described crypto developer and fan of privacy coin Monero, said on X that he facilitated a four-day workshop on cyber crime and cryptocurrency for 30 police officers at the Saint Lucia Police Academy in early April.",

    "title": "Ether ETFs Filing Process Sees Abrupt Progress, Though Approval Not Guaranteed: Sources",
    "detailedContent": "The exchanges that want to list and trade shares of spot ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds are abruptly being asked by regulators to update key filings related to these products. Exchanges are being asked to update 19b-4 filings on an accelerated basis by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, three people familiar with the situation told CoinDesk, suggesting they may be moving to approve these applications ahead of a key deadline this Thursday. That doesn\u0027t mean the ETFs will be authorized, though. Would-be issuers also need their S-1 applications approved before the products could begin trading. SEC could take an indefinite amount of time to approve the S-1 documents, one person familiar with the matter said, as it isn\u0027t tied to a deadline. One company in talks with the SEC said it feels like it might be on the right track for approval, in a turnaround from feeling some weeks ago that the SEC was dragging its feet, according to a person familiar with the matter. Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart raised their odds for the approval of a spot ether ETF to 75% from 25% on Monday after hearing chatter that the SEC could be taking a more favorable stance towards the applications. They later corrected their statement, saying that the odds were related to the 19b-4 approvals. The SEC is expected to make a decision on VanEck spot ether ETF on May 23rd. The SEC has been investigating whether ether, the chief native asset to the Ethereum blockchain, is a security, launching a formal inquiry after the network moved from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake mechanism. If ether is deemed to be a security by the SEC, that may be one reason for the regulator to reject the spot ether ETF applications. One test of the agency\u0027s view on whether ETH is a security has newly emerged at Prometheum. The special purpose broker announced Monday it had soft-launched its ether custody service. The company eventually intends to launch custody and trading services for other digital assets – importantly, assets that are treated as securities in the U.S., not commodities.

    "title": "Craig Wright Lied to UK Court \u0027Extensively and Repeatedly,\u0027 Judge Writes",
    "detailedContent": "Craig Wright lied \"extensively and repeatedly\" in both his written and oral evidence in the Crypto Open Patent Alliance case regarding his claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto, Judge James Mellor said in his written judgement on Monday. Mellor also concluded that the issue of injunctive relief - a legal remedy to stop a defendant from doing something - will be argued at a Form of Order hearing that will be appointed after the judgment has been handed down. Mellor in March concluded Wright was not Nakamoto, the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, and that he had not authored the cryptocurrency\u0027s foundational document known as the white paper. \"I want to thank those of you who sent me messages of support yesterday. I await the written judgment at which point I will consider my options for appeal,” Wright said on X (formally known as Twitter) in March. Although the ruling can be appealed, Mellor’s definitive statement following the month-long trial was cause for celebration for the broader crypto industry, which has long criticized and been victim to Wright’s legal battles against members of the community. “Dr. Wright is not the person who adopted or operated under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto in the period 2008 to 2011. Third, Dr. Wright is not the person who created the Bitcoin System. And, fourth, he is not the author of the initial versions of the Bitcoin software,” Mellor said after both parties to the trial had presented their evidence. The Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA), whose stated mission is to protect the adoption of crypto and fight threats against the new technology, filed to take Wright to court in 2021. The trial commenced on Feb. 5, with COPA accusing Wright of forgery and, later, perjury. \"I am entirely satisfied that Dr Wright lied to the Court extensively and repeatedly,\" Mellor said. \"Most of his lies related to the documents he had forged which purported to support his claim.\" COPA, whose backers include Twitter founder Jack Dorsey and crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN), said it will seek several injunctions to prevent Wright from claiming to be Nakamoto and taking Bitcoin developers to court again. It has also said it may ask U.K. prosecutors to consider perjury charges against Wright for statements made during the trial. \"Dr Wright’s attempts to prove he was/is Satoshi Nakamoto represent a most serious abuse of this Court’s process,\" Mellor said in his judgment. \"The same point applies to other jurisdictions as well: Norway in particular.\" Wright also had a nearly five year long legal battle against Norwegian bitcoiner Hodlonaut. In March, Mellor imposed a worldwide freezing order on 6 million British pounds ($7.6 million) worth of Wright assets to ensure he couldn\u0027t move them offshore or evade costs from the COPA trial. According to the order, COPA\u0027s costs for the case amounted to 6.7 million pounds at the time.

    "title": "Crypto Industry Rallies Behind House Bill as It Heads Toward Final Vote",
    "detailedContent": "The U.S. House of Representatives is on the verge of a vote that will represent the closest the cryptocurrency industry has ever been toward finally winning regulation in the U.S., and the sector\u0027s associations and top businesses are encouraging House leaders to support the effort. Through the Crypto Council for Innovation, a coalition of digital assets organizations and companies, including Coinbase, Kraken, Andreessen Horowitz, the Digital Currency Group and about 50 others, wrote a letter to Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-La.) and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), advocating for passage of the bill. The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) has been authorized for floor time next week, where observers are hoping to see a mid-week vote. The bill would set the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as a leading regulator of digital assets, and it sets out clear divisions for what the CFTC will handle and what would fall under the reach of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It would establish consumer protections – including rules around custody of customers\u0027 assets and their treatment in bankruptcy – and set up further guardrails against risky behavior. \"By passing this legislation, we can accelerate the growth of blockchain technology and digital assets, fostering financial inclusion and protecting national security,\" according to the letter. \"It is crucial for the U.S. to maintain its leadership in financial innovation.\" The crypto industry is on a high in Washington at the moment, having watched both the House and Senate easily pass a resolution overturning a crypto accounting policy from the SEC, though President Joe Biden vowed to veto the effort. That move to erase the SEC\u0027s Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121) represented a fight that went decidedly in the industry\u0027s favor, drawing many supporters from the Democratic Party that\u0027s been more reticent than Republicans in backing crypto. For that accounting tussle, more than one in five Senate Democrats voted on the industry\u0027s side, including Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), and it was about one in 10 Democrats in the House. But the comprehensive legislation now approaching a House vote is of a much higher magnitude, and key Senate Democrats have so far seemed unprepared to match the House\u0027s effort. To date, the Senate has only shown a potential willingness to fit a different crypto bill – one regulating stablecoin issuers – into a package deal with other financial legislation. Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee where the bill was launched, said the level of Democratic support for FIT21 in the House could be a major factor in whether the Senate is moved to action. When the measure cleared his committee, it did so with a handful of Democrats on board, despite opposition from their senior member, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) On its way toward the floor, the FIT21 effort drew a range of amendments called for by the House Rules Committee to meet a May 16 deadline.",

    "detailedContent": "Detained Binance executive Tigran Gambaryan’s bail application was denied by a Nigerian court on the grounds that there is a likelihood that he will manage to jump bail, the spokesperson for the executive’s family said on Friday. Binance and the executives’ money laundering, tax evasion and the exchanges detained Head of Compliance Tigran Gambaryans bail hearings all occurred on Friday in Nigeria. The court ruled that Binance can be served with the Federal Inland Revenue Service tax evasion charge through Gambaryan. Tigran’s lawyers objected to the application on the grounds that they needed to review the amended charge to advise Gambaryan on taking his plea. The court agreed to adjourn the matter to May 22 for arraignment, where charges are formally laid against the defendant. Gambaryan, who turned 40 on Friday, has been detained in Nigeria since February when he arrived with the British-Kenyan regional manager for Africa, Nadeem Anjarwalla. Anjarwalla has since escaped. “I truly cannot believe that my innocent husband is now - on his 40th birthday - having to face a trial for charges that he has nothing to do with,” said Yuki Gambaryan, the wife of Tigran Gambaryan. “The whole world is watching what he is being put through, and I just pray that common sense and justice will prevail and that Tigran will be allowed to come home to us.” A month after the exchange’s executives were detained in the country, they, along with the exchange, were charged with money laundering and tax evasion. Gambaryan was later moved to Kuje prison, which also houses the likes of members of the Boko Haram terrorist group. Nigeria’s Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) money laundering trial commenced on Friday with a Nigerian prosecutor who called on Abdulkadir Abbas from the Nigerian SEC as the first prosecution witness. After the prosecution finished examining their first witness, Tigran’s lawyers asked for a stand down—which means to put a matter on hold for a short while—to obtain certified records of certain documents in the proof of evidence to be used in their cross-examination of the witness. The court adjourned the trial until May 23 at noon. “We are deeply disappointed that Tigran Gambaryan, who has no decision-making power in the company, continues to be detained. Tigran has been dedicated to public service and fighting crime for most of his life. These charges against him are completely meritless. He should be freed while discussions continue between Binance and Nigerian government officials,\" a Binance Spokesperson said. Binance’s CEO Richard Teng recently released a blog post calling on the Nigerian government to release Gambaryan.

    "detailedContent": "Türkiye has introduced a legislative proposal aimed at reducing the risks of parties transacting with crypto assets in the country. The proposal has been presented to the parliament. The bill, introduced by ruling party chairman Abdullah Güler, includes various regulations regarding crypto assets and will be implemented by the Capital Markets Board (CMB). This proposal establishes important rules regarding crypto service providers and increases the CMB’s supervision over them. The bill aims to introduce a licensing scheme for crypto firms, which will be handled by the CMB and bring the firms under the regulator\u0027s scope. To protect customers, the scope of inspections for crypto providers will also be expanded. Although there is no provision regarding taxation in the bill, CMB and TÜBİTAK will obtain certain rates of income from crypto service providers. CMB and TÜBİTAK will receive 1% of these revenues from crypto service providers. The Scientific and Technological Research Institution of Türkiye (TÜBİTAK) is a national agency of the country whose stated goal is to develop “science, technology and innovation” policies, support and conduct research and development. This bill is expected to increase Türkiye’s compliance with international standards regarding crypto assets, eliminate criticism from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and make the country’s crypto ecosystem safer. In March, the country’s economy minister, Mehmet Şimşek, shared the government’s efforts to get out of the FATF gray list with the public and stated that a delegation will come to Türkiye for inspection in April-May and emphasized that the gray list will be removed. Also in March, the ruling AK Party Deputy Chairman of Information and Communication Technologies Ömer İleri said, \"We find it very important to carry out a legal study in the field of crypto assets. This legal regulation is primarily a study that will regulate the platforms, but beyond that, it will be a regulation that will protect our citizens and investors.\" CORRECTION (May 17, 13:00 UTC): Removes reference to the bill prohibiting firms without local origin.
