    "title": "Ether ETFs Filing Process Sees Abrupt Progress, Though Approval Not Guaranteed: Sources",
    "detailedContent": "The exchanges that want to list and trade shares of spot ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds are abruptly being asked by regulators to update key filings related to these products. Exchanges are being asked to update 19b-4 filings on an accelerated basis by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, three people familiar with the situation told CoinDesk, suggesting they may be moving to approve these applications ahead of a key deadline this Thursday. That doesn\u0027t mean the ETFs will be authorized, though. Would-be issuers also need their S-1 applications approved before the products could begin trading. SEC could take an indefinite amount of time to approve the S-1 documents, one person familiar with the matter said, as it isn\u0027t tied to a deadline. One company in talks with the SEC said it feels like it might be on the right track for approval, in a turnaround from feeling some weeks ago that the SEC was dragging its feet, according to a person familiar with the matter. Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart raised their odds for the approval of a spot ether ETF to 75% from 25% on Monday after hearing chatter that the SEC could be taking a more favorable stance towards the applications. They later corrected their statement, saying that the odds were related to the 19b-4 approvals. The SEC is expected to make a decision on VanEck spot ether ETF on May 23rd. The SEC has been investigating whether ether, the chief native asset to the Ethereum blockchain, is a security, launching a formal inquiry after the network moved from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake mechanism. If ether is deemed to be a security by the SEC, that may be one reason for the regulator to reject the spot ether ETF applications. One test of the agency\u0027s view on whether ETH is a security has newly emerged at Prometheum. The special purpose broker announced Monday it had soft-launched its ether custody service. The company eventually intends to launch custody and trading services for other digital assets – importantly, assets that are treated as securities in the U.S., not commodities.

    "detailedContent": "A Monday rally during the U.S. trading day put an end to what had been very muted crypto price action over the previous 72 hours, pushing bitcoin (BTC) above $68,000 for the first time in more than five weeks. At press time, the world\u0027s largest crypto was changing hands at $68,250. Leading the rally in crypto was Solana\u0027s (SOL), which has gained 7% over the past 24 hours, also to more than a five-week high. That outperformed both bitcoin\u0027s 2.6% advance and the CoinDesk 20\u0027s 2.8% rise. Read more: Solana\u0027s SOL Could Hit $200 By Month End, Hedge Fund Founder Says The turnaround in the recent downward price action came last week after the government reported softer-than-forecast April inflation data and quarterly institutional filings showed interesting participation in the spot bitcoin ETFs from the Wisconsin state pension board and a number of heavy-hitting hedge funds. Bitcoin rallied from just above the $60,000 to more than $66,000 by week\u0027s end. Alongside that rally came a renewal of big inflows into the spot bitcoin ETFs, which had previously witnessed net outflows over four of the previous seven weeks. All told, the spot funds added 14,389 bitcoin last week, according to HODL Capital, the strongest performance since March. Earlier Friday, Grayscale, the manager of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), announced the exit of CEO Michael Sonnenshein, who will be replaced by Goldman Sachs executive Peter Mintzberg. The move suggests Grayscale may have its eyes on a return to growing assets for GBTC as opposed to the current slow bleed of bitcoin from its holdings.",

    "title": "Phemex Promises Market-Beating Borrowing Rates With Its New Lending Protocol, Elevates Engagement to New Heights With Pulse Season 3",
    "detailedContent": "Phemex, a top-tier cryptocurrency exchange, continues its streak of CeFi and DeFi innovations. Transitioning from a purely centralized platform, Phemex embraced decentralization last year and has evolved into a hybrid exchange, merging the best features of CEXes and DEXes. The latest fruit of this evolution is the Phemex Lending Protocol, which allows users to borrow cryptocurrency against their digital assets with favorable rates and ultimate flexibility, signaling Phemex\u0027s commitment to innovative, user-empowering solutions. While crypto enthusiasts have long expected that feature from their exchanges, Phemex revealed earlier this week some new advantages that can’t be found anywhere else. If you think about it, there are three main reasons why you might want to use any crypto exchange’s lending services: By each of these measures, the Phemex Lending Protocol meets or exceeds industry standards. Participants can take out loans denominated in USDT, BTC or ETH without the need to sell their crypto assets. Loans can also be taken out in PT, Phemex’s high-potential native coin. Because all loans are securely collateralized by participants’ assets, Phemex can provide flexibility to choose loan terms with variable interest rates. Whatever the time horizon on the loan, crypto exchanges can generally offer better rates than brick-and-mortar banks, according to Forbes Advisor. Even so, the Phemex team is confident that their loans compare favorably even among crypto exchanges. Phemex highlights its competitive edge with an annual USDT borrowing interest rate starting at 3.57%, a figure notably lower than the double-digit rates prevalent on competing platforms – not to mention almost two percentage points lower than money-center banks lend to each other overnight. For holders of vePT – the wrapped PT version that will soon confer voting authority in Phemex’s governing DAO – the deal gets even sweeter with an additional 30% discount on borrowing rates. Of course, Phemex community members can withdraw and reallocate funds as they see fit, unfettered by undue limitations or delays. This means that Phemex traders can enjoy more lucrative capital efficiency than they can on other exchanges, aligning with the cryptosphere’s goal of unlocking the potential of money. At Token2049 in Dubai last week, Phemex made a significant splash by hosting an elite gathering of major crypto community players and key opinion leaders. The extensive two-day networking event featured an insightful keynote by Phemex CEO Federico Variola. Another highlight of Token2049 was the introduction of the Phemex Lending Protocol, when Phemex COO Stella Chan showcased its competitive borrowing rates and the opportunity for users to supply assets in return for substantial earnings. In the future, the platform is expected to add uncollateralized loan capabilities which would propel its services beyond that of most DeFi lending protocols. “Phemex Lending Protocol is changing the game with low borrowing rates and a clear loan-to-value ratio, without any hidden fees,\" Chan announced. \"With $22 million in liquidity to start, users can now secure loans leveraging their holdings at just 3.57% APY – far below the high rates of other platforms. Our protocol ensures that users keep control, allowing them to freely withdraw and manage their funds. Additionally, by contributing to our lending pools, they can earn competitive APY returns, creating a robust passive income stream. It\u0027s a complete solution for favorable borrowing and earning.” By integrating these lending features, Phemex is not only expanding its services but also reinforcing its commitment to fostering a more inclusive and accessible financial environment for all its users. Certainly, Phemex has a grander vision than just providing lower interest rates on collateralized loans. The team there has been all about innovation. All this leads into its Web3 ecosystem, Phemexia, aiming to provide users with greater autonomy and cultivate a robust community where trust and permissionless collaboration are paramount. “Phemex is at the forefront as the crypto world evolves far beyond just digital cash, spearheading the charge into a digital ecosystem integral to our online lives,\" Chan says. \"Our users want democratized financial tools with uncompromising security, and we\u0027re delivering just that. We\u0027re pioneering in the Web3 space, answering the call with innovations like our new hybrid stack. It combines on-chain autonomy with reliable centralized performance, showcased by our latest offering – the Phemex Lending Protocol. Soon, users will be able to enhance our exchange\u0027s liquidity and earn rewards using our AMM protocol. We\u0027re eager to drive more innovation and sustain our collaborations with visionary partners in upcoming integrations and listings.” While Phemex’s PT token may be the most successful exchange-native coin this year, Phemex also generated a lot of buzz with the launch of its new SocialFi product Pulse. The platform elevates community groups within the social media realm by offering a decentralized hub, similar to a mix of Telegram\u0027s groups and Twitter\u0027s connectivity, but within the realm of Web3. Pulse sets itself apart with a unique reward system where community interaction directly earns users PT, a feature unmatched by any other social network. Phemex is now gearing up for the launch of Pulse Season 3, responding to community feedback by enhancing the platform with features that incentivize superior content. With the introduction of “Cast” for sharing insightful content and “Tip” as a way to appreciate high-quality engagement, users can now earn tips for their casts, increasing their chances of winning a portion of the daily 10,000 PT prize pool and ensuring that outstanding content is rewarded. Ultimately, the team’s goal is to expand Web3 use cases into the broader world. The more people get comfortable with blockchain technology and functions, the more widely digital assets will gain acceptance – and the faster these assets will appreciate in value. “Our mission is rooted in providing a user-centric ecosystem that offers the best trading experiences alongside a vibrant community. As we roll out our hybrid stack with the Phemex Lending launch, we\u0027re simultaneously fine-tuning Pulse based on user insights,” Chan says. “Community-driven development is pivotal to Pulse\u0027s growth, and with Season 3 on the horizon, we aim to reward the creation and engagement of premium content. We are dedicated to nurturing a community where meaningful interaction is recognized and rewarded.”",

Sonnenshein, who became CEO in 2021, will be replaced by Peter Mintzberg, head of strategy for asset and wealth management at Goldman Sachs on Aug. 15, Grayscale said on Monday. Mintzberg has more than 20 years of experience in TradFi, having previously worked at BlackRock, OppenheimerFunds and Invesco. CFO Edward McGee will lead the company on an interim basis until Mintzberg fills the role. \"Michael guided the firm through exponential growth \u0026 oversaw its pivotal role in bringing spot bitcoin ETFs to market, leading the way for the broader financial industry,\" Barry Silbert, CEO of Grayscale\u0027s parent company Digital Currency Group, wrote on X. In January, Grayscale was one of about a dozen firms to finally have a spot bitcoin ETF approved to list in the U.S. in January. The firm had taken the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to court over the regulator\u0027s repeated refusal to allow it to convert its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), then a closed-end fund, into an ETF. GBTC saw around $15 billion of outflows in the following three months as the firm kept fees higher than its competitors.

    "detailedContent": "Craig Wright lied \"extensively and repeatedly\" in both his written and oral evidence in the Crypto Open Patent Alliance case regarding his claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto, Judge James Mellor said in his written judgement on Monday. Mellor also concluded that the issue of injunctive relief - a legal remedy to stop a defendant from doing something - will be argued at a Form of Order hearing that will be appointed after the judgment has been handed down. Mellor in March concluded Wright was not Nakamoto, the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, and that he had not authored the cryptocurrency\u0027s foundational document known as the white paper. \"I want to thank those of you who sent me messages of support yesterday. I await the written judgment at which point I will consider my options for appeal,” Wright said on X (formally known as Twitter) in March. Although the ruling can be appealed, Mellor’s definitive statement following the month-long trial was cause for celebration for the broader crypto industry, which has long criticized and been victim to Wright’s legal battles against members of the community. “Dr. Wright is not the person who adopted or operated under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto in the period 2008 to 2011. Third, Dr. Wright is not the person who created the Bitcoin System. And, fourth, he is not the author of the initial versions of the Bitcoin software,” Mellor said after both parties to the trial had presented their evidence. The Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA), whose stated mission is to protect the adoption of crypto and fight threats against the new technology, filed to take Wright to court in 2021. The trial commenced on Feb. 5, with COPA accusing Wright of forgery and, later, perjury. \"I am entirely satisfied that Dr Wright lied to the Court extensively and repeatedly,\" Mellor said. \"Most of his lies related to the documents he had forged which purported to support his claim.\" COPA, whose backers include Twitter founder Jack Dorsey and crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN), said it will seek several injunctions to prevent Wright from claiming to be Nakamoto and taking Bitcoin developers to court again. It has also said it may ask U.K. prosecutors to consider perjury charges against Wright for statements made during the trial. \"Dr Wright’s attempts to prove he was/is Satoshi Nakamoto represent a most serious abuse of this Court’s process,\" Mellor said in his judgment. \"The same point applies to other jurisdictions as well: Norway in particular.\" Wright also had a nearly five year long legal battle against Norwegian bitcoiner Hodlonaut. In March, Mellor imposed a worldwide freezing order on 6 million British pounds ($7.6 million) worth of Wright assets to ensure he couldn\u0027t move them offshore or evade costs from the COPA trial. According to the order, COPA\u0027s costs for the case amounted to 6.7 million pounds at the time.

    "title": "Will RFK Jr. Debate Trump or Biden? Probably Not, Prediction Market Says",
    "detailedContent": "This week in prediction markets… A presidential debate that includes independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. alongside President Biden or Republican frontrunner Donald Trump is unlikely to happen, bettors on crypto-based predictions platform Polymarket are signaling. \"Yes\" shares in the contract are trading at 27 cents, meaning the market sees a 27% chance of it occurring. Each share pays out $1 if the prediction comes true, and zero if not. The machinations of the American political-industrial complex make it difficult for a third party, or independent candidate, to succeed. Ballot access laws favor major parties, creating significant barriers for third-party candidates. Getting on a debate stage has another high threshold of its own. Rules for the first debate, scheduled for June 27 on CNN, say that the candidates must appear on enough state ballots to hypothetically reach 270 electoral votes, and also receive 15% in four polls. A second debate on ABC is scheduled for September, and it also has a 15% polling rule. Currently, RFK Jr. is polling at just under 10% in national polls compiled by 270toWin. Right now his team says they have confirmed ballot access, or are working on it, in enough states to win 201 electoral votes, which is enough to be a spoiler, but not to win the presidency. But independent candidates have participated in the debates in living memory: in 1992, independent candidate H. Ross Perot appeared on stage alongside George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton. To be clear, the Polymarket contract says that RFK Jr. must participate in a debate including Trump or Biden. It doesn\u0027t say that the debate must be an official one. Trump\u0027s campaign wants more debates, according to reports, proposing one per month from June to September, preferring two-hour stand-up debates in larger venues with live audiences. The current train of thought holds that RFK Jr.\u0027s campaign is more of a threat to Biden than Trump\u0027s, and polls that include him give Trump a slight edge, up to 5 points in some. It\u0027s plausible that the Trump campaign could decide to host a streaming debate with the Kennedy campaign, or hold it on a lesser-known network like OANN. It just needs to be a \"publicly broadcast debate\" per Polymarket\u0027s rules. (Don\u0027t forget that Kennedy is coming to CoinDesk\u0027s Consensus conference, taking the stage on May 31 at 4:30 PM) Sora, OpenAI\u0027s text-to-video generator, wowed the world when Sam Altman\u0027s company demoed the project back in February. Missing is a launch date. Bettors on Kalshi, a U.S.-regulated platform, are predicting that launch will take place sometime between September and the end of 2025, with only a 27% chance it will occur before September. But there\u0027s one thing that\u0027s getting in the way of a wide release of Sora: the availability of high-end graphics processing units (GPUs). Rendering video from text prompts is going to take a lot of them, more, in fact, than many of the world\u0027s largest customers of Nvidia have in their data centers. According to a report by Factorial Funds, OpenAI\u0027s Sora faces significant challenges regarding GPU availability, as mainstream adoption of text-to-video generation would require hundreds of thousands of server-grade GPUs at a cost of tens of billions. Factorial estimates that supporting the creator community of platforms like TikTok and YouTube alone would necessitate around 720,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs, far exceeding the combined resources of major tech companies like Microsoft, Meta, and Google. But remember, the contract isn\u0027t asking if Sora will be widely available. A launch with limited availability and a high monthly cost would still count. It\u0027s just asking if it will launch. Punters on Polymarket aren’t expecting any of the best-known cat meme coins to become the first such token to reach the $1 billion market cap milestone. A market capitalization bet for cat-themed tokens, which some expect to flip their dog-themed counterparts in the next bull cycle, has racked up $1.2 million in bets since going live in March. As of Monday, popular tokens Popcat (POPCAT) and cat in a dogs world (MEW) have 22% and 7% odds, while shark cat (SC) and toshi (TOSHI) have odds of under 2%. Despite all these memes being valued at over $200 million and occupying massive mindshare in the meme coin community, punters aren’t expecting any of these to become the first billion-dollar cat meme. Instead, the “others/none in 2024” category dominates the odds at 68%. Other cat-themed tokens in the open market but not referenced in the Polymarket contract are mog (MOG), wen (WEN) and maneki (MANEKI), according to CoinGecko. The high odds for two distinct outcomes suggest traders either expect a whole other cat meme to become the biggest or expect no single token in the category to get such a rich valuation. The apparent bearish sentiment is likely not due to the lack of buying pressure, either. Two dog tokens, bonk (BONK), dogwifhat (WIF), and the frog-themed pepe (PEPE), were launched in 2023 and zoomed to over $3 billion each in less than a year, showcasing the demand for such tokens. Among meme coin hunters, the perceived cuteness of a meme drives its virality and, ultimately, price. So which is cuter: a dog with a pink beanie hat or a cat with a mouth that pops? The punters have decided. A market betting on Solana fees flipping those of Ethereum has fallen 12 points in the past week, after jumping up to 35% earlier in the month. The “Solana flips ETH in daily fees in May?” market, which has seen over $60,000 in wagers placed, is a market on whether the daily fees of Solana (SOL) will surpass that of Ethereum (ETH) for any day within this market’s time frame from May 10 to May 31. Odds of the flip rose earlier this month due to a revival of meme coin trading as GameStop stock prices surged higher, aiding growth in meme tokens. However, the odds fell following a $2 million exploit on Pump.Fun, a tool that lets anyone deploy a tradeable token on Solana. The brief exploit may have been expected by some to slow the rapid issuance of meme coins on Solana, which would in turn depress daily fees. Despite being extremely cheap compared to Ethereum, the Solana blockchain collects millions of dollars in fees every day thanks to the sheer magnitude of meme coin trading activity on the network. Still, the fee difference isn’t a big one. Blockchain activity on Ethereum netted it over $1.84 million in the past 24 hours, while it was nearly $1.2 million for Solana, DefiLlama data shows. Pump.Fun has since come back online, and is seeing thousands of new memes launched daily as usual. Peruse it at your risk.",

These are just a handful of the cutting-edge blockchain tech topics on the agenda at CoinDesk\u0027s Consensus 2024 conference, which runs Wednesday, May 29, through Friday, May 31, in Austin, Texas. For blockchain developers, it\u0027s red meat. For others, it may sound unfamiliar. For everyone, including those somewhere in between, the three days are packed with opportunities to learn about the hottest crypto tech on Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Cosmos and XRP Ledger – from the world\u0027s top experts. We took a spin through the agenda to identify stages and sessions likely to interest blockchain developers and people interested in the technology. In general there are six broad categories of relevant programming: The overall Consensus agenda is pretty sprawling. In terms of the blockchain tech highlights, the following would represent our picks.

    "title": "Crypto Old-Head Otoh Talks Casascius Bitcoins, Tax Havens and Old Friends",
    "detailedContent": "It’s quite likely that Otoh has lost more bitcoin than most people will ever hold. An early bitcoin investor, Otoh, a pseudonym that stands for “on the other hand,” has many lessons to share about finding opportunities and making one’s own luck. Otoh is a speaker at this year’s Consensus festival, in Austin, Texas, May 29-31. Scheduled to speak on stage at Consensus 2024, in Austin, Texas, alongside crypto luminaries like Litecoin creator Charlie Lee and BTCC and Ballet founder Bobby Lee, Otoh is known among the early crypto crowd for his massive holdings of physical bitcoins – a.k.a. Casascius coins. “I\u0027ve never sold any. I’ve just been accumulating them as my version of a cold storage,” Otoh told CoinDesk in an interview, discussing his recent auction of over 200 worth of physical bitcoins in what was the Heritage auction firm’s first crypto sale. Casascius coins, created by Mike Caldwell (who went by Casascius, an acronym for “call a spade a spade,” on Bitcoin forums), were a solution to spending bitcoin in face-to-face transactions by embedding a Bitcoin private key in a metal coin. The last ones were made in 2013 after the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network told Caldwell that he was operating an unlicensed money transmitter business. There are only about 90,000 Casascius coins in circulation, of varying denominations, though other manufacturers including Bobby Lee created their own versions. A part of Bitcoin lore and its physical history, Casascius coins are now sought after by collectors (some are so valuable that they have to be declared to U.S. Customs when entering the country). In some sense, these coins are the most long lived and recognizable image of the purely a digital currency. “It seemed the right time to let some of the physical coins go,” Otoh said. “Let other people look after them and enjoy having them.” Of course, part of the danger of bringing bitcoin into the physical realm is that it makes the assets as easy to steal as a $20 note from mom’s purse – and unfortunately, Otoh thinks he was the victim of a theft about a decade ago. He recounted a story of receiving a shipment of coins where the box had been obviously tampered with. The 55 BTC missing from his collection were worth about $20,000 at the time they were purchased, and are now worth about $3.5 million, “which is a huge sum in most anyone\u0027s book,” he said. “I\u0027m very happy to offer a half a million dollar reward for their return. And unconditionally, I wouldn\u0027t want to press charges if someone decided to give them back to me,” he added. See also: Why, for Some, Crypto Is the Defining Political Issue of Our Times | Opinion CoinDesk caught up with Otoh ahead of Consensus to discuss his recent auction of vintage physical bitcoins, early investments in other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum’s initial coin offering and how he manages his wealth by diversifying into properties around the world and residing in a tax haven in the British Channel Islands. Could you give a sense of what you’re talking about at Consensus? I’m on the panel about physical bitcoins. I\u0027m basically a fill-in for Mike Caldwell, who invented Casascius coins, who couldn\u0027t make it unfortunately. Oh, that\u0027s so cool. Would be nice to meet him one day. Bobby Lee and Charlie Lee asked if I\u0027d be a substitute for the gap on the panel because I am a large investor. Do you remember buying your first coin? Yes, very much. It was at the London Bitcoin Conference in 2012. I had just started on bitcoin in the summer of 2011, around July. I remember at the time I met with some German guys – there were all these privacy advocates wearing masks who had a whole bunch of physical coins to sell. I believe it was 10 regular bitcoins and a 10 bitcoin unit piece. The price at the time, with the premium and everything, was $12 a bitcoin. What does Otoh stand for? It’s an acronym for “on the other hand.” That\u0027s how it\u0027s usually used. I just adopted it because I find myself, a lot of the time, not necessarily being argumentative but looking at different viewpoints. I thought bitcoin and crypto is also a different way of looking at finance. Nearly everyone had a nickname on the BitcoinTalk forum. That\u0027s the way that came about, but I didn\u0027t give it much thought at the time. It was just the first thing that came into my head. Are there any particular memories of the early days of Bitcoin that you remember fondly? Fondly? Yes, that must be getting my first coin – that was a big deal. At the time people were still giving away free coins. By the time I joined, word had spread, and it often wasn\u0027t a full coin anymore, just a fraction of a coin, but it was still fun to have my own address and then be sent this little token amount of coins to see how it could function. At the time I was traveling between Europe and the States quite a bit and also buying and selling in Europe and the States. With bitcoin, it suddenly became really easy to send money. A few of the other memories are more traumatic. It\u0027s very easy to mess up. As you learn as you go. You\u0027ve probably lost more bitcoins than most people have today. If you count the ones that were stolen off me. Like that list I just gave you that I put together from nine years ago. Somewhere out there there is a lost, stolen treasure of a few million dollars. What do you suspect happened there? A rogue employee? I think it is most likely a rogue U.S. Postal Service employee who just used a box cutter and saw something that looked promising. He probably thought it was Gold Eagles or Silver Eagles or something. I don\u0027t know what the reaction would be, whether they were disgusted to see it was just some weird tokens and threw them away or whether they thought “Oh, this looks cool.” I’ve always hoped that I’d have a brainstorm and remember if I’ve stashed them away somewhere. But it doesn\u0027t make any sense – I\u0027ve got everything else very well looked after and itemized. A friend of mine whose house I had been staying in at that time remembers receiving a box that was cut open and resealed. Is there anything that you want to say about the OTOH Collection of Physical Cryptocurrency? Well, after a decade, I decided it\u0027s time to sell. I\u0027ve never sold any, I’ve just been accumulating them as my version of a cold storage. Now that I\u0027ve sold all my digital crypto, it seemed the right time to let some of the physical coins go. Let other people look after them and enjoy having them. You\u0027re also a real estate investor. At this point, do you think it’s better for people to invest in bitcoin or physical property? I think it’s a mixture of the two. Bitcoin is high-risk, but potentially it has very high returns. And property is a hedge. It\u0027s a safety net. It\u0027s also very hard to steal, whereas bitcoins can be very easy to steal. If I was still in my 20s, then I\u0027d probably be keeping a much higher percentage in crypto, but nowadays I like the security of having a bunch of properties and enjoy renovating them. Are you interested in other digital assets? In the past I pretty much have been. I was the largest holder of litecoin (LTC) when it was a few cents. I think I had roughly 600,000. It was the first altcoin, and was quite controversial with Bitcoin Maximalists. They disliked it intensely because they thought it withdrew funds and interest away from Bitcoin. But I was quite convinced from the first time I saw it, it\u0027s impossible for anything to exist without its opposite. And so that paid out very well. After Litecoin, I moved into Dash and was the largest holder of those and helped develop the project in some ways. And then I kind of lost interest and moved onto other things. I was highly recommended Ethereum at a Dutch conference and participated in the ICO. I got 100 bitcoins worth, which was 210,000 ether (ETH). Unfortunately, I sold those way too soon. I made 100% or 200% profit, but I sold them for something like $2. So I will rue the potential $800 million there. Otherwise I\u0027m pretty much fully bitcoin nowadays. The way you discussed bitcoin earlier in the conversation you discussed it mostly as a method of transaction. Are you convinced by the arguments that it has properties like gold? I think it is excellent as an investment. I think that\u0027s its main use at the moment. It’s perhaps the best performing investment in history, and it continues to grow. It is a trillion dollar asset class, and a great way to store value. Satoshi viewed it in the beginning as a hedge against the degenerate behavior of central governments and banks abusing the currencies that we will have to use every day. It\u0027s much more versatile than gold, in that it can be transferred pretty much anywhere around the world from anyone to anyone, instantly, with no armored trucks or anything and next to no fees. It\u0027s quite miraculous really, that it\u0027s come into existence. It\u0027s still very early days, but it really has transformed the world in many many ways. What have been your biggest purchases made with crypto? I must admit I\u0027ve done very little with buying and selling with crypto. I go from fiat currency into crypto and then back out to fiat currency. Capital gains taxes make spending crypto sort of annoying, to some extent. For many people it would, yes. I\u0027m fortunate that I am based in a tax haven where there isn\u0027t any capital gains tax. I make sure that I\u0027m physically there when I cash any out. So I don\u0027t have that issue. There\u0027s also no income tax. You mentioned you have a home in California. How do you balance the tax situation there, where state tax authorities may want to charge you income tax? I’ve got homes in many countries around the world; it doesn\u0027t mean I\u0027m suddenly a tax resident. I make sure I count my days very carefully – I don’t overstay. As long as I\u0027m not here for more than six months of the year, I won\u0027t be liable for any tax. And I don\u0027t do any business here. Do you mind if I ask what tax haven? It’s a little island in the British Channel Islands called Sark. It’s a three square mile island and fairly unique in the world for having next to no tax. You just pay a small proportion of your property tax as a contribution to the kind of upkeep of the island. The main thing about it that\u0027s attractive is you don\u0027t have to keep records of what you\u0027re doing, which would have been hugely complicated when I was converting altcoins into bitcoin and then into other alternative currencies and then back into dollars. I pity the people who had to try and keep these records and then present them to a tax authority – it must be a nightmare. Did you give up your passport? No, I still keep a U.K. passport. I could trade it in for a Guernsey passport, which is the main island in the channel. It\u0027s really just a clone of the U.K.. It has all the same benefits, but I haven\u0027t bothered to do it. It doesn\u0027t really matter what nationality I have. It really only matters where I\u0027m a fiscal resident. How would you describe your political views? Well, like many people, with age I probably have become a little more conservative in some ways. But I\u0027m pretty much a capitalist; I believe that\u0027s a good way for people to behave. I\u0027m not overtly political. I was probably quite anarchist in the past. I just adapt to whatever the majority believes. I am not trying to change things myself in a big way – I’m pretty apolitical. Is there anything more you want to say about the possible theft of those Casascius coins? I believe it was 55 bitcoins in value, something like $3.5 million at present value. At the time they were lost or taken they were only worth about $13,000. Still a lot but nothing compared to right now. So I\u0027m very happy to offer a half a million dollar reward for their return. And unconditionally, I wouldn\u0027t want to press charges if someone decided to give them back to me. See also: Spot Bitcoin ETFs: What You Need to Know One day, I expect they\u0027ll turn up unless they\u0027ve gone on a destructive route somehow. Everyone can see the addresses; I was really surprised when I checked a couple of weeks ago that they had never been moved and that they hadn\u0027t been peeled. So they\u0027re probably out there somewhere. Last question, what are you looking forward to at Consensus? Well, meeting Bobby Lee and Charlie Lee again. They both in their own ways have been very instrumental in helping me with my crypto journey. Charlie Lee by inventing Litecoin, where I did extremely well – probably even better than I did with bitcoin. And Bobby Lee for having BTCC (also known as BTCChina) and the physical coins. He produced physical coins just like Mike\u0027s Casascius coins. I have still got all my BTCC coins. That will be a future auction. I\u0027ve had quite a few adventures with the physical coins. I had to physically go to Shanghai to pick them up, as they couldn\u0027t be shipped at the time. That was an adventure in itself. There\u0027s other people that I know from forums and interacting with on the internet who I\u0027m sure it would be nice to see again in person if I\u0027ve met them at other conferences. It\u0027s a chance to put people together and exchange ideas that if one just sat behind a computer at home, perhaps wouldn\u0027t happen. So I\u0027m looking forward to it. It\u0027s quite exciting. It\u0027s my first visit to Texas.",

    "title": "\u0027What Are We Waiting for\u0027? SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce Discusses Moving Crypto Regulation Forward",
    "detailedContent": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is not a monolithic institution. Look no further than Hester Peirce (a.k.a. Crypto Mom), who is currently serving her second term as one of five overseeing commissioners. Over the past several years, Peirce has made a reputation as a defender of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology — writing innumerable dissenting opinions regarding the many legal actions the SEC has waged against crypto protocols and companies. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce will speak at Consensus 2024 this May. Grab your pass here. To some extent, Peirce’s disagreements with SEC Chair Gary Gensler stem from their varying philosophical and political beliefs. Peirce, a Republican and member of the Federalist Society, thinks the government should have a limited hand in regulating commerce. Whereas Gensler, who swims in Democratic circles, is often harder to pin down. While Gensler has seemingly evolving opinions on crypto (having appeared as a blockchain supporter while teaching the subject at MIT), Pierce has remained steadfast in her support of economic innovation. “It’s a fundamental American principle that people are free to make choices. The government is not there to protect people from their own choices,” Peirce told CoinDesk in an interview. This view colors Peirce’s opinions on whether the SEC should block spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs), go after U.S.-based exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken as well as what role agency should play in overseeing crypto markets. CoinDesk caught up with Commissioner Peirce ahead of Consensus 2024, where she’s scheduled to speak this May, to discuss the SEC’s enforcement actions, her distaste of Big Banks and where U.S. crypto regulation first went wrong. Hi mom. To start off with an easy one, would you be able to describe the fundamental split in opinion that you have with SEC Chair Gary Gensler? It\u0027s not an easy question. Just to start out, look, the views I represent and will reflect are my own views, not necessarily those of the SEC or my fellow commissioners, so I can\u0027t speak for anyone else at the commission. Are you talking about crypto specifically or about the universe of issues? I wanted to maybe widen the scope. What are your fundamental political or philosophical differences? So, in terms of philosophy — I have the view that I don\u0027t necessarily know what\u0027s best for other people. We have our statutory mandates that we have to implement. But within those mandates, we\u0027re often given discretion. And if we have discretion, my preference is to say, well, let\u0027s let market participants make a decision about what they want to do. Now, sometimes there\u0027s a reason that we have to step into the middle of a transaction, and say “No, you can\u0027t do that” or “Yes, you can do it, but you have to do it in this particular way.” But we better have a really good reason for stepping into the middle of that transaction. See also: SEC in \u0027Enforcement-Only Mode\u0027 for Crypto, Commissioner Peirce Says It’s a fundamental American principle that people are free to make choices. The government is not there to protect people from their own choices. It\u0027s there to protect people if someone else harms them, but not to make their life decisions for them. In the past, you\u0027ve been critical of big banks but have also argued that the regulatory response to the Great Financial Crisis was offbase. I’m wondering if this somehow connects to your interest in crypto? I think my interest in crypto stems from a couple of things. First, I think it\u0027s a good test for how we handle innovation — or maybe a bad test in the sense that I think we\u0027re not passing it. Crypto came to us with a lot of new players and a lot of new ideas. I think we should have figured out how to work with these new players and figure out a way how they could do what they wanted to do in a way that would be compliant, but also allowed them to move forward. There is a connection in the sense that when I look at the financial crisis — a lot of people have looked at it and come to different conclusions about the causes — one of the things going on was poor regulatory design. A regulatory design that led to everyone making the same dumb mistake at the same time. One way to address that is to build resilience into the system, and having heterogeneity in the system is a good way to build resilience. There are some interesting concepts within crypto that allow for more decentralization of the financial system. So yes, in that sense, there\u0027s a connection. But do I think that the decentralized future is going to replace centralized intermediaries in the financial system? My prediction would be not; people want to deal with a centralized intermediary. But I think that there will be a role for decentralized finance. Maybe it\u0027s in the background. Maybe it’s more than that. I predict most people will access it through a centralized intermediary. I could be wrong. You don\u0027t have to answer this question, but do you hold cryptocurrencies? Because I work on these issues all the time. I do not, and would not even if I could. I feel like there\u0027d be a conflict. If you work on these issues, you can\u0027t have crypto, basically. I\u0027m speaking only for what the rules are that apply to me. A question from my editor: Prometheum; what\u0027s going on there? Is this an example of the SEC picking winners? I\u0027m not going to speak to any particular entity. Nice try. That\u0027s fair enough. Your Safe Harbor proposal is common sense, but in the intervening years since you\u0027ve published it, I think it\u0027s arguably become clear that maybe three years is too short of a time for protocols to decentralize. Solana, Cardano, even Ethereum to an extent have centralized entities directing development — the non-profit organizations founded alongside the network. Do you think we should be thinking about decentralization on a longer timeline? Decades? Again, decentralization is not an end in itself. It is the right thing in certain circumstances. However, sometimes having a centralized entity is the right thing. We should all take a step back and think about what we\u0027re trying to achieve. And fundamentally, what we need to achieve is the ability for people to know whether or not they\u0027re dealing with a security, so when they do something or sell something they understand whether it’s a securities offering. They need to know that in the primary and secondary markets. Then, if we decide that certain crypto assets are securities, or that it doesn\u0027t make sense to adjust the rules, there is a sensible framework that makes sense for crypto assets. Does it make sense to set up some sort of disclosure regime for centralized entities? That\u0027s really a congressional decision. But we can\u0027t even really have these conversations at the SEC right now because the conclusion is just to apply exactly the same rules that apply to stocks and be done with it — and I just don\u0027t think that works. But just taking a step back and thinking about what we\u0027re really trying to solve might take some pressure off the decentralization question. How closely do you or the other four commissioners work with the Enforcement Division. Do you suggest cases to litigate? So, just to give you a sense of how things work on the enforcement side. As with the rulemaking side, it\u0027s the staff that does the bulk of the work. They consider a rule and will propose it for us and we\u0027ll consider it. Often the vote happens at a public, open meeting. With enforcement actions, we also get recommendations. Typically, the staff will recommend authorizing an enforcement action and settling it at the same time. So we often don\u0027t see the case until the end, and are not involved in the guts of the matter. So we\u0027re either going to authorize the division to sue or authorize you to sue and settle with them on the same day. Most of our cases settle like that right away. The voting happens in a process called seriatim, where we\u0027re just voting on the papers, or we vote at a meeting where we have a discussion, but those meetings are, as you might guess, not open to the public. So in a way, if there was a change in the presidential administration in the upcoming election, then the current enforcement regime could continue, more or less, as is? I think these are great questions because the structure of the agency is a little strange. Strange in the sense that it\u0027s not like a lot of other agencies that have a single head. But while there are five of us commissioners, Chair Gensler does have the authority to set the rulemaking agenda and staff also report to him. The chair can certainly push the direction that things go, but you\u0027re right, it\u0027s not as if when a new chairman comes in all the existing enforcement investigations just stop. The agency is designed to keep going. Would you take the job if Trump or Tulsi were elected? That\u0027s not even on the radar. No? Yeah, I\u0027m focused on The Now, and trying to try to shift us to a better place. I\u0027ve been here for six years, and it\u0027s very discouraging to see that we have not taken a productive path at all. To me, it\u0027s inevitable that we\u0027ll have to take a productive path at some point — so why not start now? What are we waiting for? This isn\u0027t a question about the present, but I am curious in what ways the agency has changed since your first couple of stints during the early 2000s at the SEC? Over the years we\u0027ve gotten progressively more prescriptive in our rulemaking approach. An issue I raised in a speech last week is that we\u0027ve gotten less willing to engage on some of the difficult issues with the staff and the public. That has not been a positive set of changes. Is there any reason to believe or to hope that the spot market ETH ETF process won\u0027t unfold similarly to what happened with the spot market bitcoin ETFs? I can\u0027t talk about that one because we\u0027ve got some applications under consideration. Do you think the 2017 DAO Report set the crypto regulation off on the wrong foot? Yeah, I do. Because I think that the facts of the DAO Report are different from the facts of most crypto offerings that we see, right? The facts were unique. And I just don\u0027t think that the legal analysis that we\u0027ve applied to thinking about tokens has been helpful for really getting to the crux of the issue. See also: SEC Blasts \u0027Purportedly Decentralized\u0027 DAOs in $1.7M Barnbridge Settlement So if I could rewind — I wasn\u0027t here at the time of the DAO report, though I’ve learned a lot in that time — I would change the way we approach things. Do you agree with Judge Failla’s interpretation in the XRP case, that tokens aren\u0027t necessarily securities, but when you sell them to qualified investors it’s an investment contract? Well, again, because that\u0027s litigation, I don\u0027t want to talk about any particular judge\u0027s opinion. But as I have said, in other contexts, when you think about an investment contract, whether it\u0027s a digital asset or some other kind of a tangible asset, the asset itself is not the security on its own. It’s when you offer that asset along with an investment contract that’s what makes a security a security. It becomes the object at the center of the investment contract. But you still have to think about those two things as distinct. The orange groves in Howey were not on their own securities. Your dissenting opinions are often quite artful. Was it your idea or your co-author Mark Uyeda’s idea to include a play in the ShapeShift document? I can\u0027t answer that question either. Thanks again for your time. Well, I appreciate you taking the time and I hope you have a great afternoon.",

    "title": "Irthu Suresh: Using Blockchain Tech to Reduce Water Shortages",
    "detailedContent": "Much of the world takes water for granted. And much of the world has so little water that it’s a matter of life and death. So how can we send water from areas of surplus to areas of need? This is the mission of Atlantis, a project devoted to solving issues stemming from climate change, focusing primarily on water. And they’re trying to crack this problem by using blockchain. Irthu Suresh is a speaker at this year’s Consensus festival in Austin, Texas, May 29-31. Atlantis is not just theoretical. Across 50 villages in the region of Chikmagalur, India, Atlantis deployed a Web3 solution that incentivized people to effectively transfer water from the Haves to the Have Nots. A clever system of “bounties” encouraged villagers to perform tasks that enabled this new distribution. And the pilot program worked. “We’ve exchanged more than 21,000 kiloliters of water,” says Irthu Suresh, CEO of Atlantis. Giving a sneak preview of what he’ll share in Austin at Consensus, Suresh explains why Atlantis adopted blockchain, the challenges they had to overcome for onboarding, and why he wants the world to know that Web3 is not just for trading but that “we can use this to fight water problems, to fight poverty.” Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity. Atlantis didn’t start out as a blockchain organization, but eventually you incorporated the tech. What led you to this? Irthu Suresh: We were trying to build solutions for climate change — primarily through water — as a Web2 company, but a private entity trying to build for the commons was not really striking a chord. And we ran into all kinds of challenges with existing power structures, everything from regulations to unregulated mafia in India. It’s very easy to bring down an idea if it’s built by a private entity. All you need is a bunch of lawyers. And that led us to think, “How can me and my co-founder become insignificant over time as this system scales?\" And that led us to look at decentralized distributed systems. We figured that if this works, no one should be able to bring it down. Then we realized that there were people who were willing to harvest additional water and then supply it into the network. This was creating additional pools of surplus resources. And we were like, “What if we could build this entire system on blockchain?” So what does that look like exactly? In most parts of the world, things like water are heavily regulated. And you have these centralized grids. But as cities and spaces expand, often these centralized grids struggle to catch up. But India is a great example of being built, historically, on decentralized communities. You have small pockets of villages taking care of their needs. It\u0027s hyper-local. So for us, it was a no-brainer to bring some kind of concept that solves for resource allocation problems. There are some parts where water is abundant, and nobody cares about it. And there are other places where access to water is life and death. So for the pilot, when we partnered with Mercy Corps Ventures, we chose a specific location in India where on one side of this hill there’s an abundance of water, and on the other side of the hill there’s a drought. And how could people in this region exchange this excess water? How could we create the infrastructure locally itself? So for our pilot program in Chikmagalur — a rural region with 50 villages — we started with people in different water stress zone. Interesting. What did your system do? First we had people locally volunteer to spread awareness, then we had local people sign up to become water harvesters. Once we had these harvesters and there was a rain that was captured, there was an opportunity for it to be exchanged. How does blockchain fit into this? We built the product on a mobile native app. On this app, everybody could create a profile, sign up, and first mention what their skill is. And based on the skill, we start giving you tasks. And these tasks are pretty much to build up this peer-to-peer water network. You could take part in surveying, you could take part in water sample testing, you could sign up as someone who wants to spread awareness through workshops, or you could become a harvester. All of these tasks are gamified; we call them bounties. People sign up and then they do the required steps that are required, and then they get incentivized. We knew this first required a distributed ledger that is tamper-proof, and we knew that blockchain is useful for that. Amazing. Can you quantify the impact so far? Yeah. We’ve exchanged more than 21,000 kiloliters of water. The network has over 3,000 people and it\u0027s covering 50 villages. Out of the 3,000, predominantly most are consumers who are coming into the network to access water. But we have almost 150 harvesters in the network. And then we have a bunch of surveyors and validators. What’s a validator in this context? Let’s say you plug into the network and say, \"Hey, I\u0027m a harvester.\" Then we put out a bounty for someone in the locality to become a validator, who goes to your place and just validates that, \"Hey, these guys have the infrastructure for it.\" So what happens, in essence, is we’re creating a bunch of these local green jobs. And all of these different tasks are gamified using our bounty system. What problems did you run into? One was off-ramping. Especially in India, it\u0027s tough to off-ramp, because the regulations are still in a gray area. And then starting from the first MVP we designed, at the very onset of onboarding, whenever we asked people to connect to a wallet, that didn\u0027t work. Because people were like, \"What\u0027s a wallet?\" And I got an absolute schooling on UI and UX. We had to really figure out when is the right place to introduce blockchain or the Web3 terminologies. And we had to take extra steps to educate people about it. Because people are like, ”Oh, it\u0027s crypto. That means it\u0027s a scam.” And we’re like, “No, no, hold on!” Right? Like, there\u0027s so much more to it! What tokens are you using to drive the mechanics? We do have an internal token, which we\u0027ll someday launch. During the pilot we actively used it. But seeing how the Web3 market works, we are strong believers that unless we hit a strong product-market fit, launching a token doesn\u0027t make sense for us. So we’ve integrated a mechanism in which different tokens can be brought into the platform. If someone wants to fund a water project in Africa using Solana they can, whereas if somebody wants to do a water project in Vietnam using Optimism, they\u0027re able to do that. We really worked on the interoperability aspect of it because climate change does not care which chain you are on. Well said. Last question: What are you most looking forward to at Consensus? So, one of the biggest lifelines for our project has been Bitcoin. And I know that Consensus is a great place to go and meet people who have pioneered some of these technologies we are using today. I\u0027m hoping that we\u0027re able to come and talk about the things that we’ve been doing with blockchain, which is not necessarily just DeFi trading. We really want people to know that, “Hey, we can use this to fight water problems, to fight poverty.\" The idea of distributed ledgers is super powerful. More people need to know that there\u0027s actual examples of this being played out. Great sentiment. Congrats on what you’ve built and see you in Austin.",

    "title": "DeFi Gigabrain Tarun Chitra on ETH Staking, Restaking and Why ‘Financial Nihilism\u0027 Is a Real Consumer Product",
    "detailedContent": "Crypto is a world built for autodidacts, a playground for polymaths. Tarun Chitra, the founder of the risk management, economic research and software optimization organization Gauntlet, is just one shining example. In a conversation with Chitra, this comes through. It seems there is no corner of crypto he hasn’t examined. Chitra, who often takes his time to pause before answering questions, will be speaking at Consensus 2024, May 29-31, in Austin, Texas. CoinDesk caught up with the bona fide DeFi celebrity known for his colorful style (hair, glasses and clothes) to talk about new financial primitives in crypto, artificial wombs and why he appreciates hecklers. This interview has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity. I thought maybe we could start off with a quick round of overrated/underrated. You could skip any of them or clarify your statements if you prefer. Sure. Life extension? I have a very rough classification in my head of, like, passive versus active life extension. Passive is: I become healthier by eating better and maybe I take some supplements. Active is: I get all sorts of esoteric experimental therapies and, like, injections. You know what I mean, one involves surgeries and the other a simpler change in habits. I was thinking more of the former. Probably overrated. I think the latter is rated correctly. Yeah. Healthy living is good. But that\u0027s why I wanted to separate those. Artificial wombs? I actually think fairly rated. Maybe slightly underrated, actually. But not super underrated. I feel like they\u0027re getting a lot of hype. CLOBs [central limit order book exchanges]. Overrated. Could you say why? I think we had the era of CLOBs as the only thing that worked. Then AMMs took off and CLOBs were like crap. And then in the perpetuals and low-latency blockchain worlds everyone was like “CLOBs are better, CLOBs are better.” Not that we have seen a lot of people necessarily going back to CLOBs, but I feel like the tide has shifted right now. People are constantly sh*ting on AMMs. So that\u0027s fine. But it feels like there\u0027s always this cyclic thing between the two. See also: What Is an Automated Market Maker? Dutch auctions? One shot Dutch auctions are overrated. Multi-shot Dutch auctions are underrated. Omnichains? Can you define what you mean by omnichain for this context? Honestly, not so much. It\u0027s just a term that I’ve seen pop up a lot recently, and I can’t tell what they are. Yeah, well, I have found it to be more of a marketing term than anything real, to be totally honest. So overrated, it feels like it\u0027s not a real thing. It doesn\u0027t refer to a single technical thing that I could write down equations for and tell you like, “this is a guarantee you\u0027re getting from this.” That was the impression that I got as well. This is maybe a mean one, but Aave. Decline to answer. Who are your intellectual heroes? Paul Dirac. John von Neumann. I’m trying to think of a more recent one. The boring one is like the Terence Taos of the world. Is there someone who\u0027s not as famous? … Yeah, stick with those. Those are those well known enough, I feel like the other ones are way too niche. Fair enough. You wrote about DAO governance in 2021. I was wondering if you think we\u0027ve learned anything since then? if DAO governance has at all improved in the intervening years? I think there\u0027s kind of this thing where the actual governance processes for a lot of DAO either worsened or improved. Either due to sclerosis or due to centralized takeover or whatever, there\u0027s lots of reasons for one or the other. I don\u0027t think there have been many new mechanisms that people have focused on because you don\u0027t get rewarded for improving a DAO mechanism. See also: DAOs Beware: Neo-Imperialism Is on the Rise With Compound, I feel like because of the way they launched, they actually got rewarded as a team for improving DAO mechanisms when they decentralized governance in 2020. But since then everyone who has innovated on governance has been generally outside of DeFi. And those haven\u0027t made it. There\u0027s still a lot of mechanistic innovation that hasn\u0027t been done. And part of the reason that hasn\u0027t been done is it\u0027s underfunded relative to other things, right? Like you can raise much more money for making another robot than you could ever raise for a new governance system. When is it appropriate for crypto to embrace financial nihilism? As in, lean into it? Good question. Feels like we are currently leaning in. So I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s an answer to when it is appropriate – but hasn\u0027t it already happened? The problem for me is that financial nihilism is a real consumer application. Most other things considered crypto for consumers, people are like, it’s a scam, or a lie, or it doesn’t really need crypto at all it’d work fine as Web2 to me – I can go down the list. Financial nihilism is a real consumer product. Like there\u0027s no there\u0027s no way around it. It\u0027s hard to get around the fact that they\u0027ve found a way to make Binance more fun to someone who doesn\u0027t like looking at candles – and I think that\u0027s why Pump.fun exists. People love it because it\u0027s the same thing but it doesn\u0027t feel like it and that\u0027s a good consumer application. This will disappoint all the people who raise millions of dollars to do consumer crypto, but it\u0027s just what it is. Do you think Farcaster will ever fully supplant Crypto Twitter and would it be a loss to Farcaster if CT was recreated in full on Farcaster? Farcaster is like where the refugees of the WAGMI [we are all gonna make it] movement of 2021 went. It was all people who really were genuine in the beginning about being part of the cult of toxic positivity. I feel like the ones who were earnest about it went and made Farcaster. I just don\u0027t feel the trader-type people are ever going to perfectly intermesh, so it doesn\u0027t seem possible to fully re-create the “degen side.” Farcaster is so much more wholesome. Do you see any interesting financial primitives emerging that you think will become more and more important? I mean, in general, I think re-staking comes under that. But things that let you not know what network you\u0027re on, but give you the same security guarantees of that network; re-staking is one version of that, aggregation stuff that people are doing and ZK-land is one version of that. I think that\u0027s the key to making the UX of the multi-chain world feel anywhere near as good as something like Solana. There are concerns that there\u0027s already too much ETH staked or will soon be too much ETH staked. Do you buy into that argument? Is there an appropriate amount? That honestly depends. I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a static, fixed quantity that will always forever be the right amount. It depends on usage. If it turns out there\u0027s a lot of usage of ETH in applications on-chain or in centralized exchanges, then it\u0027s kind of bad to have a lot of ETH staked because then there\u0027s no liquidity and you could run into a supply crunch. On the other hand, if there is too little ETH staked, then yeah, of course, different types of attacks are possible. The biggest problem in some ways with proof-of-stake is that it’s easy to calculate the dollar-value of an attack. I can always just take 1/3 times the amount staked and figure out how expensive it is to attack. See also: The Investor\u0027s Definitive Guide to Proof-of-Work With proof-of-work, because people can join and leave, it takes a while to figure out how expensive an attack is and you can\u0027t figure it out quite as precisely. So the lower bound for proof-of-work is actually harder to estimate, and it’s actually harder to attack in some ways. So I think it\u0027s always gonna be dynamic. Some new technologies will help reduce how much you have to have staked – that\u0027s the point of ZK and advanced cryptography, but it will never be constant. It really just depends on how much applications want to use, and if applications are using ether a lot. How many pairs of glasses do you own? Probably like 10. And lastly, is there anything in particular that you\u0027re looking forward to at Consensus? Doing another live podcast. I was there last time. It was good! Yeah, the live podcasts are fun. Especially if you get like an audience heckler. I’ll try to think of something clever to heckle. Yeah well, thanks for stopping by.",

    "detailedContent": "Bitcoin layer 2s. Ethereum restaking. Interoperability. AI. DePIN. Next-generation cryptography. These are just a handful of the cutting-edge blockchain tech topics on the agenda at CoinDesk\u0027s Consensus 2024 conference, which runs Wednesday, May 29, through Friday, May 31, in Austin, Texas. For blockchain developers, it\u0027s red meat. For others, it may sound unfamiliar. For everyone, including those somewhere in between, the three days are packed with opportunities to learn about the hottest crypto tech on Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Cosmos and XRP Ledger – from the world\u0027s top experts. We took a spin through the agenda to identify stages and sessions likely to interest blockchain developers and people interested in the technology. In general there are six broad categories of relevant programming: The overall Consensus agenda is pretty sprawling. In terms of the blockchain tech highlights, the following would represent our picks. Wednesday: 1:45 p.m. (Mainstage): Joe Lubin of Consensys discusses Ethereum with Consensus Chair Michael Casey. 2:45 p.m. (Mainstage): Emin Gün Sirer, CEO, Ava Labs, the primary developer of Avalanche, joins a panel on what blockchain can do for AI, and what AI can do for crypto. 3 p.m. (Town Square): Bryan Bishop, early Bitcoin coder (and now a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal editor), discusses the early days on a panel with other crypto OGs. Thursday: 12:45 p.m. (Mainstage): David Marcus, former head of the Facebook/Meta Diem/Libra, talks about Lightspark, his digital-payments startup based on Bitcoin\u0027s Lightning Network. 1:15 p.m. (Mainstage): Sergey Nazarov, co-founder of Chainlink, talks about his project\u0027s work with the global banking-payments network Swift, in a panel moderated by CoinDesk\u0027s Sam Kessler. 4:15 p.m. (Town Square): John Adler, co-founder and chief research officer of Celestia Labs, and Austin Federa, head of strategy for Solana Foundation, discuss whether modular or monolithic blockchains are the better way to scale. Friday: 10 a.m. (Money Reimagined Stage): MakerDAO co-founder Rune Christensen discusses where DeFi is headed. 10:40 a.m. (Mainstage): Raj Gokal, co-founder and president of Solana Labs, discusses the network\u0027s future and the upcoming release of the Firedancer software designed to improve performance. 11 a.m. (Money Reimagined Stage): Helium CEO Abhay Kumar speaks on a panel about the future of \"decentralized physical infrastructure networks,\" or DePIN (formerly referred to as Internet of Things, or IoT). 11:30 a.m. (Mainstage): Casey Rodarmor, the developer who almost single-handedly created the two most impactful protocols launched atop Bitcoin in the past two years – Ordinals and Runes – talks about what comes next and his vision for the oldest and largest blockchain. 11:45 a.m. (Money Reimagined Stage): CoinDesk\u0027s Margaux Nijkerk leads a discussion on liquid staking and restaking. 12 p.m. (Town Square): AMA with Casey Rodarmor 12:15 p.m. (Startup Village): Injective co-founder Eric Chen discusses his vision for the future of finance. 3 p.m. (Money Reimagined Stage): Gauntlet co-founder Tarun Chitra speaks on a panel about \"de-risking DeFi,\" from preventing smart-contract bugs and rug pulls to dealing with treasury management strategies and audits.

    "title": "This Is (Hopefully) the Last CoinDesk Article to Mention Craig Wright",
    "detailedContent": "Craig Wright is not Satoshi Nakamoto and not the author of the Bitcoin white paper, as was determined by Justice James Mellor, who handed down that judgment after the COPA v Wright trial wrapped up. Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates. This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here. But not only is Craig Wright not Satoshi Nakamoto and not the author of the Bitcoin white paper, he also wasted the court’s time, according to Mellor’s much-anticipated, 231-page written assessment of the trial. As CoinDesk’s Camomile Shumba summarized: Wright is apparently looking to appeal the decision – a bad sign for anyone who wished that COPA’s brave attempt to actually litigate and settle the matter of whether CSW was stealing Satoshi’s valor (by stealing his identity) once and for all. Ever since he arrived on the scene in December 2015, Wright has been causing chaos for the crypto industry – including suing Bitcoin Core developers, public figures and a feline astronaut called Hodlonaut, who was an affirmed private citizen before his CSW imbroglio. And that was essentially the motivation behind COPA’s suit. Although all of CSW’s legal claims essentially centered around the claim that he invented Bitcoin (he was able to copyright the white paper), in all of his libel and infringement lawsuits over the years that was always an incidental issue. Read more: Craig Wright Assets Frozen by UK Judge to Prevent Him Evading Court Costs COPA, which is backed by Jack Dorsey and Coinbase, among others, put the question directly when it filed suit in 2021. Then, over several weeks in a U.K. court, the group was able to systematically prove to the court that Wright had been forging documents, spewing lies and filing costly and wasteful lawsuits for years. “This decision is a watershed moment for the open-source community and even more importantly, a definitive win for the truth. Developers can now continue their important work maintaining, iterating on, and improving the Bitcoin network without risking their personal livelihoods or fearing costly and time-consuming litigation from Craig Wright,” a COPA spokesperson said. In the judgment, which, really, goes above-and-beyond the call of duty to excoriate the Australian computer scientist, Justice Mellor said Wright \"lied to the court repeatedly,\" committed forgery \"on a grand scale\" and “is not nearly as clever as he thinks he is.” (The FT’s Alphaville has a nice rundown of the juiciest morsels from the document.) It’s not just that the judge appears to understand the extent of CSW’s grift, but also Bitcoin itself, arguing that seeking to control Bitcoin through the courts is something Satoshi would never dream of doing. So, with this, I think we may finally be able to bid Wright adieu. He has dropped his five-year legal actions against Holdonaut and podcaster Peter McCormack, and will no longer be able to pursue cases in the U.K., Wright’s chosen venue for the majority of his legal actions due to the nation’s extremely lax libel laws. Good night, sweet prince.",

    "detailedContent": "A Monday rally during the U.S. trading day put an end to what had been very muted crypto price action over the previous 72 hours, pushing bitcoin (BTC) above $68,000 for the first time in more than five weeks. At press time, the world\u0027s largest crypto was changing hands at $68,250. Leading the rally in crypto was Solana\u0027s (SOL), which has gained 7% over the past 24 hours, also to more than a five-week high. That outperformed both bitcoin\u0027s 2.6% advance and the CoinDesk 20\u0027s 2.8% rise.

Bitcoin rallied from just above the $60,000 to more than $66,000 by week\u0027s end. Alongside that rally came a renewal of big inflows into the spot bitcoin ETFs, which had previously witnessed net outflows over four of the previous seven weeks. All told, the spot funds added 14,389 bitcoin last week, according to HODL Capital, the strongest performance since March. Earlier Friday, Grayscale, the manager of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), announced the exit of CEO Michael Sonnenshein, who will be replaced by Goldman Sachs executive Peter Mintzberg. The move suggests Grayscale may have its eyes on a return to growing assets for GBTC as opposed to the current slow bleed of bitcoin from its holdings.",

    "detailedContent": "This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day. Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) were little changed, suggesting a consolidation after last week\u0027s rally. BTC traded at around $67,000 while ETH held steady about $3,100. The wider digital asset market as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) has added 0.3% in the last 24 hours. This week, attention will turn to the SEC\u0027s decision on the approval of ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with the deadline for a response to VanEck\u0027s and Ark/21 Shares\u0027 applications due on May 23 and May 24, respectively. Traders may be keeping their powder dry until then. Traders are also going to be eyeing Nvidia\u0027s earnings, scheduled for Wednesday. Bitcoin trades strongly in correlation with Nvidia, as do artificial intelligence-themed tokens, which surged in February as the chip designer reported better-than-expected earnings. NVDA has risen over 90% year-to-date, with analysts expecting the company to report a big increase in revenue for the quarter ending in April. The direct correlation between Nvidia and ether market movement isn\u0027t as strong as it once was during the mining boom. Still, the rising tide of bitcoin and AI tokens – should Nvidia\u0027s earnings remain strong – will likely lift all boats. Genesis will return 77% of customer assets, worth $3 billion in cash and crypto, to its creditors. Parent company DCG will not be among them. The lender\u0027s holding company filed for bankruptcy in January 2023 following the fallout from events in the crypto market the year before. In the immediate aftermath of the filing, the market was skeptical that customers would be made whole and the bankruptcy proceedings would be completed in an expedient manner. Bankruptcy claims marketplace Xclaim initially listed Genesis claims at 35% of their value in January 2023. As of today, Genesis claims for bitcoin or ether are trading at 97%-110% for claims over $10 million, while claims under $1 million are trading at 74%-94%. - Omkar Godbole",

    "title": "Ether, Bitcoin Open Asia Trading Week Flat as ETH ETF Decision, Nvidia Earnings Loom",
    "detailedContent": "The crypto market was listless early Monday, with bitcoin (BTC), the biggest digital asset market by value, trading flat at $67,156 and ether (ETH) changing hands at $3,127, according to CoinDesk Indices data. The consolidation follows a week of bullish action triggered by renewed optimism about a U.S. rate cut and the rally in stocks. Things could soon get busier again with the first decisions for ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) due. The Securities and Exchange Commission is set to weigh in on VanEck\u0027s ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) on May 23 and the Ark/21 Shares one on May 24, as well as Nvidia earnings. March Zheng, managing partner of Bizantine Capital, told CoinDesk in an interview that while the market has priced near the certainty of a rejection, there are still some reasons to be optimistic. \"There are reasons to believe that the report will contain silver linings for the delay, which should signal an eventual approval of Ethereum in the next year,\" Zheng said. \"The removal of staking prepositions by filers reclassifies underlying ETH as commodities supported by the CFTC and can pave a major pathway going forward.\" Polymarket currently gives a 10% chance of an ether ETF being approved by May 31, a 13% chance of approval by June 30, and a 28% chance of approval this year. Recently, Coinbase analyst David Han wrote that the market may be \"underestimating the timing and odds of a potential approval.\" Zheng argued that positive ETH ETF news might also boost trading sentiments for BASE, a Layer-2 network, whose native token\u0027s price has dropped by nearly 25% in the last two weeks. Traders are also going to be eyeing Nvidia\u0027s earnings, scheduled for Wednesday.

    "title": "Research Firm Favors Bitcoin \u0027Covered Strangle\u0027 Strategy to Enhance Portfolio Yield by 17%",
    "detailedContent": "Bitcoin (BTC) investors looking to generate extra income in addition to their spot market holdings should consider setting a \"covered strangle\" options strategy, research firm 10X, which has an impeccable record of predicting market trends, said Monday. The \u0027covered strangle\u0027 strategy involves holding the underlying asset in the spot market and simultaneously selling an out-of-the-money (OTM) call option at levels (known as strikes in options parlance) above the underlying asset\u0027s going market rate and selling an OTM put at strikes below the underlying\u0027s spot market price. The premium received for selling/shorting the call option, or protecting the counterparty from price rallies, and selling the put or insurance against downtrends, represents the extra yield. 10x suggests selling a $100,000 strike call, which is 50% above BTC\u0027s current market price, and a $50,000 strike put, both expiring in December 2024, while holding the cryptocurrency in the spot market. \"Our favorite strategy is to buy bitcoin Spot, Sell 100,000 strike call, and Sell 50,000 strike put for the December 2024 expiry. Selling the call could yield 11%, and selling the put could yield 6%,\" Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said in Monday\u0027s client note, detailing the suggestion. \"Hence, this strategy provides us with either a 17% downside buffer or 17% more yield, depending on where BTC closes in December, plus we would capture all the upside (or downside) for bitcoin,\" Thielen added. The strategy is preferred when the market outlook is bullish, but the uptrend is expected to unfold slowly, keeping implied volatility or investors\u0027 expectations for price turbulence low. In such conditions, options, particularly OTM call and put options, bleed value faster as expiry nears, making money for sellers. The strategy, though appealing, is now without risks and requires a high tolerance for risk. That\u0027s because the risk is leveraged below the level at which the put option is sold, in this case, $50,000. \"Below the lower strike price, both the long stock and short put incur losses, and, as a result, percentage losses are twice what they would be for a covered call position [buy spot \u003d sell OTM call] alone,\" Fidelity said in a \u0027covered strangle\" explainer. In other words, 10x\u0027s strategy is for those who believe bitcoin\u0027s bull market will progress slowly and corrections, if any, will not see prices drop below $50,000. As of writing, bitcoin changed hands at $67,170, representing a 58% year-to-date gain, CoinDesk data show. Several analysts, including Thielen and Arthur Hayes, former CEO of crypto exchange BitMEX, expect a slow grind higher.",

    "title": "Ether ETFs Filing Process Sees Abrupt Progress, Though Approval Not Guaranteed: Sources",
    "detailedContent": "The exchanges that want to list and trade shares of spot ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds are abruptly being asked by regulators to update key filings related to these products. Exchanges are being asked to update 19b-4 filings on an accelerated basis by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, three people familiar with the situation told CoinDesk, suggesting they may be moving to approve these applications ahead of a key deadline this Thursday. That doesn\u0027t mean the ETFs will be authorized, though. Would-be issuers also need their S-1 applications approved before the products could begin trading. SEC could take an indefinite amount of time to approve the S-1 documents, one person familiar with the matter said, as it isn\u0027t tied to a deadline. One company in talks with the SEC said it feels like it might be on the right track for approval, in a turnaround from feeling some weeks ago that the SEC was dragging its feet, according to a person familiar with the matter. Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart raised their odds for the approval of a spot ether ETF to 75% from 25% on Monday after hearing chatter that the SEC could be taking a more favorable stance towards the applications. They later corrected their statement, saying that the odds were related to the 19b-4 approvals. The SEC is expected to make a decision on VanEck spot ether ETF on May 23rd. The SEC has been investigating whether ether, the chief native asset to the Ethereum blockchain, is a security, launching a formal inquiry after the network moved from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake mechanism. If ether is deemed to be a security by the SEC, that may be one reason for the regulator to reject the spot ether ETF applications. One test of the agency\u0027s view on whether ETH is a security has newly emerged at Prometheum. The special purpose broker announced Monday it had soft-launched its ether custody service. The company eventually intends to launch custody and trading services for other digital assets – importantly, assets that are treated as securities in the U.S., not commodities.

    "title": "Ether, Bitcoin Open Asia Trading Week Flat as ETH ETF Decision, Nvidia Earnings Loom",
    "detailedContent": "The crypto market was listless early Monday, with bitcoin (BTC), the biggest digital asset market by value, trading flat at $67,156 and ether (ETH) changing hands at $3,127, according to CoinDesk Indices data. The consolidation follows a week of bullish action triggered by renewed optimism about a U.S. rate cut and the rally in stocks. Things could soon get busier again with the first decisions for ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) due. The Securities and Exchange Commission is set to weigh in on VanEck\u0027s ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) on May 23 and the Ark/21 Shares one on May 24, as well as Nvidia earnings. March Zheng, managing partner of Bizantine Capital, told CoinDesk in an interview that while the market has priced near the certainty of a rejection, there are still some reasons to be optimistic. \"There are reasons to believe that the report will contain silver linings for the delay, which should signal an eventual approval of Ethereum in the next year,\" Zheng said. \"The removal of staking prepositions by filers reclassifies underlying ETH as commodities supported by the CFTC and can pave a major pathway going forward.\" Polymarket currently gives a 10% chance of an ether ETF being approved by May 31, a 13% chance of approval by June 30, and a 28% chance of approval this year. Recently, Coinbase analyst David Han wrote that the market may be \"underestimating the timing and odds of a potential approval.\" Zheng argued that positive ETH ETF news might also boost trading sentiments for BASE, a Layer-2 network, whose native token\u0027s price has dropped by nearly 25% in the last two weeks. Traders are also going to be eyeing Nvidia\u0027s earnings, scheduled for Wednesday. Bitcoin trades strongly in correlation with Nvidia, as do Artificial intelligence-themed tokens, which surged in February as the chip designer reported better-than-expected earnings. The direct correlation between Nvidia and ether market movement isn\u0027t as strong as it once was during the mining boom. Still, the rising tide of bitcoin and AI tokens – should Nvidia\u0027s earnings remain strong – will likely lift all boats.",

    "title": "Ether Bears Hit a Brick Wall as Price Collides With Bull-Market Trendline",
    "detailedContent": "Ether\u0027s (ETH) sell-off has stalled, with bears hitting a brick wall characterized by an upward-sloping trendline drawn off October and January lows, according to charting platform TradingView. The bears\u0027 inability to penetrate that bull-market trendline since Monday suggests they might have to back up a bit and allow a price bounce before making another attempt at extending recent declines. The native token of the Ethereum blockchain has dropped more than 15% to $3,000 from highs near $4,100 two months ago, according to CoinDesk data. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), a measure of the broader crypto market, lost 17% in the same period. Supporting the case for an ether price bounce is the daily MACD histogram, which has flipped positive, signaling renewed bullish momentum. The MACD is widely used to gauge trend strength and changes. Intraday momentum is steadily improving, with the widely tracked 50-hour simple moving average (SMA) again trending north, providing reassurance. The immediate resistance is seen at the 50-day SMA near $3,180, followed by a descending trendline representing the recent correction, currently at $3,225. If the price drops below the bullish trendline, that would mean the broader uptrend has ended, opening the door for a more pronounced sell-off.",

    "title": "Bitcoin Traders Target $74K Next Week as BTC Spot ETFs Log Four Days of Inflows",
    "detailedContent": "Institutional demand and rising appetite for risk assets could cause bitcoin to breach all-time highs of $74,000 as early as next week, some traders say. “Bitcoin was pulling back towards $65K on Thursday but is already trying to regain its footing above $66K on Friday morning. If cryptocurrencies get support from the global risk appetite on Friday, Bitcoin could exceed $70K over the weekend,” shared Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro senior market analyst, in a note to CoinDesk, referring to increased inflows from spot ETFs. “A test of the $71K-$74K highs area, in our view, could happen as early as early next week, triggering a new episode of FOMO,” Kuptsikevich. Singapore-based QCP Capital gave out similar price targets in a client note earlier this week. Such bullish outlooks come as U.S.-listed spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking the asset have logged four straight days of inflows, ending Thursday at $257 million in net inflows. This is a nearly 180-degree turn from the action of the past few weeks – with some of the biggest ETFs seeing zero inflows on some days. BlackRock’s IBIT received $94 million in inflows on Thursday, the largest among peers. GrayScale’s GBTC, which has mostly seen outflows since its January listing, received over $4.6 million in inflows. Earlier this week, multiple regulatory filings showed that several big-name funds, such as Millennium Management and Elliot Capital, held millions worth of bitcoin ETFs in their portfolios. The softer-than-expected US Consumer Price Index (CPI), which rose 0.3% versus 0.4% in March amid economist forecasts for 0.4%, triggered a break out of the range for BTC on Wednesday. The asset regained the $66,000 mark for the first time since April and posted its biggest single-day gain since March.",

    "title": "Ether-Bitcoin Ratio Slides to Lowest Since April 2021. Here\u0027s Why",
    "detailedContent": "The ratio between ether (ETH) and bitcoin’s (BTC) dollar-denominated prices continues to slide, extending year-to-date losses as suggested by the bearish death cross pattern a month ago. ETH/BTC slipped to 0.04563 on crypto exchange Binance soon before press time, reaching the lowest since April 2021, according to charting platform TradingView. This year, the ratio has declined nearly 16%, indicating a bias for bitcoin or the leading cryptocurrency by market value. The slide to three-year lows follows reduced demand for exchange-traded products (ETPs) tied to ether. According to Bloomberg data quoted by ETC Group in its weekly report, global ether ETPs registered net outflows of around $63.5 million last week, with Hong Kong-listed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) losing the most. Meanwhile, bitcoin ETPs raked in $92.5 million last week. Several factors, including competing layer 1s and lingering uncertainty about the debut of spot ETH approvals in the U.S, are likely responsible for ETH falling out of investor favor. “The approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has reinforced bitcoin’s store-of-value narrative and its status as a macro asset. On the other hand, open questions about ETH’s fundamental positioning within the crypto sector remain. Competing layer-1s (L1s) like Solana detract from Ethereum’s positioning as the \u0027go-to\u0027 network for decentralized app (dApp) deployment,” Coinbase Institutional’s Research analyst David Han said in a note Wednesday. Solana’s share in total decentralized exchange volumes has grown tenfold from 2% to 21% in one year, eating into Ethereum\u0027s market share. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) green-lighted nearly a dozen spot BTC ETFs in January. Since then, these funds have drawn roughly $12 billion in net inflows, according to data source Farside Investors. Approval of spot ETFs tied to ether will open a similar pool of capital for Ethereum’s native token, although it’s unclear when the SEC will approve it. Traders on decentralized betting platform Polymarket see just a 10% chance of the SEC approving a spot ETF on or before May 31. The regulator has until May 23 to decide whether to approve or reject VanEck’s application to launch a spot Ethereum ETF. The deadline for BlackRock’s application is June 23. According to finance lawyer Scott Johnsson, the SEC is looking for reasons to deny ETH ETF applications by BlackRock and others on grounds that they have been improperly filed as commodity-based trust shares and do not qualify if they hold a security. Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets at Marex Solutions, said ether is a \"lightning rod\" for negative sentiment from crypto native and external players and has several weak spots. “Capital gets fragmented. There are proportionally greater numbers of ways to get exposure to the ecosystem through the many Layer 2s tokens (OP, ARB…) and native protocol tokens in each one. The capital gets fragmented,\" Solot said in an email. Solot added that strong anti-ETH sentiment from [rival] Solana community and Bitcoin propounders is driving negative ether narratives and the high beta cryptocurrency is a \"perfect vehicle\" for external players to express bearish view given it trades on traditional exchanges such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Lastly, Ether recently turned inflationary, reversing the bullish deflationary supply trend seen consistently since its parent network Ethereum transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus ecosystem in September 2022.",

    "detailedContent": "Bullish sentiment for riskier assets following soft inflation figures could propel bitcoin (BTC) prices toward the $74,000 mark in the coming days as institutional demand continues to grow, Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a note early Thursday. The softer-than-expected U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.3% versus 0.4% in March amid economist forecasts for 0.4%, triggering a breakout for BTC. The asset regained the $66,000 mark for the first time since April and posted its biggest single-day gain since March. Such a move, coupled with demand from traditional finance, could see bitcoin regaining its March record of $73,700. “We expect bullish momentum here that could take us back to the highs of nearly $74,000,” QCP traders said. “The desk saw sizeable buyers of $100K-$120k BTC Calls for Dec 2024 on this move higher in spot.” “Institutional demand for bitcoin continues to grow, with large asset managers Millennium and Schonfeld investing approximately 3% and 2% of their AUM into the BTC spot ETF,” they added. Multiple filings on Wednesday showed that several big-name funds, such as Millenium Management and Elliot Capital, held millions worth of bitcoin ETFs in their portfolios. Meanwhile, some analysts say the selling pressure on bitcoin appears to have eased off, citing on-chain and exchange data. “Short-term Bitcoin holders are selling at basically zero profit and traders are depleting their unrealized profits in the last few months,” CryptoQuant analysts shared in a Thursday report. “Bitcoin balances at OTC desks stabilizing, which suggests there is less Bitcoin supply coming into the market to sell via these entities.” The firm defines short-term traders as addresses that hold bitcoin for less than 155 days and are likely to capitalize on short-term price movements. A breakout in bitcoin comes after weeks of low volatility. Since March, the market has been range-bound between $60,000 and $70,000, with the halving event in April not providing the expected boost due to a general lack of market catalysts, traders have previously said. Higher risk appetite for token bets showed signs of beginning earlier this week after an X post by retail trader Keith Gill sent some meme stocks and meme coins surging. Gill\u0027s online persona and investment strategies contributed to a short squeeze on video game retailer GameStop’s stock in 2021, and his first post on social application X in three years was considered by some to be a sign of market volatility in the months ahead.",

The developers said the increased use of the Shibarium blockchain for transactions will result in a higher burn rate for the SHIB token, reducing supply. The SHIB price has risen 8.8% in the past 24 hours, in line with a broader market jump. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), a measure of the wider crypto market, has rallied almost 7%. Users can now float new liquidity pools (LPs) on Shibarium, allowing traders to swap tokens on the network and earn a cut of trading fees for providing liquidity. ShibaSwap held over $25 million in locked tokens as of Thursday, data shows, with $1.7 million in trading volumes in the past 24 hours. “The more transactions will run on Shibarium blockchain, the more the protocol will burn base gas fees which will impact the overall burn rate of $SHIB,” they said. Burns refer to the permanent removal of tokens from circulating supply by sending them to an address that no one controls. Every swap and stake on ShibaSwap contributes to the ecosystem\u0027s growth as increased trading volumes bring higher fees for stakers and LP providers, developers said in an X post.",

    "detailedContent": "Futures powerhouse Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) plans to offer spot bitcoin trading to clients as demand for the product mounts among market participants, the Financial Times reported on Thursday. CME is already the top bitcoin futures exchange by open interest, while offshore, non-regulated Binance dominates the spot market. The exchange has held discussions with traders who want to trade bitcoin on a regulated marketplace, the FT reported, citing people with direct knowledge of the talks. CME\u0027s spot trading business could be run through the EBS currency trading venue in Switzerland, the report added. The exchange did not want to comment on the report. The spot market will complement the CME’s existing standard and micro futures contracts, which are widely considered a proxy for institutional activity, and help the exchange become more dominant in the crypto market. The CME is already the top bitcoin futures exchange by open interest, while the offshore, non-regulated Binance dominates the spot market. Coinbase (COIN), the only U.S. traded crypto exchange, is No. 3 by daily trading volume.

    "title": "GameStop Rally Sends Meme Coins Skywards; PEPE, FLOKI, MOG Surge",
    "detailedContent": "Top meme coins climbed higher Tuesday after a viral post by retail trader Keith Gill, whose cult following contributed to the GameStop short squeeze of 2021, sent some stocks and tokens flying at the start of the week. Gill, who turned $58,000 into an estimated $50 million between 2019 and 2021 by buying GameStop (GME) options, sparked a run in the stock after posting from his @TheRoaringKitty X account for the first time in three years. A mere picture posted by Gill sent the stock skywards, nearly doubling in value on Monday despite multiple trading halts, even as Gill did not directly mention Gamestop. GameSpot’s retail euphoria quickly spread to token markets. Several offshoots and joke tokens referring to GameStop, Gill, and his online kitten persona flooded Solana and Ethereum blockchains – with a meme GME token surging as much as 500%. A video featuring the X-Men character Wolverine posted later on by Gill caused dozens of WOLVERINE tokens floated by opportunistic developers, most falling over 90% in the hours following. The action was not limited to microcaps. Larger tokens Pepe (PEPE) and floki (FLOKI), and cat-themed tokens popcat (POPCAT) and mog (MOG) jumped as much as 30% in the past 24 hours, data shows. Such revival showed an early sign of risk appetite returning to the crypto markets following weeks of relatively lull trading action. Gill’s post revived talks of a dogecoin (DOGE) rally among some traders, similar to its 2021, which occurred after GameStop’s run from $4 to $120 in a month. “Roaring Kitty is living proof that retail can mog (outperform) institutions at the highest level,” MOG token developer Shisui told CoinDesk in a message. “His return was perceived as bullish for meme coins because the market remembered that much of the Gamestop mania of 2021 spilled over to $DOGE and other meme coins.” “While we are far from being in a true risk-on environment, the price movements after Roaring Kitty’s comeback hint at which assets will outperform when frothy conditions return. The market has shown its hand, and it wants $MOG,” Shisui added. Among developers and traders, part of Gill’s influential appeal isn’t only that he has made generational wealth: It’s the allure of a single trader taking down hedge funds from his bedroom using publicly available tools and the chance of them landing a similar move. That has contributed to the general acceptance of meme tokens and made the sector a strong contender to DeFi and utility crypto projects compared to previous cycles, some opine. “The industry is only just starting to come to grasp with memes being fun, relatable, enjoyable, and representative of the average person,” said B, lead developer at Floki, in a note to CoinDesk. “The vast majority of retail is flocking over to meme coins and ignoring the tired old \"utility\" crypto projects.” “While many are worried about the \"lack of fundamentals surrounding meme coins\" and the implications of the continued attention they are getting for the space, the strong interest in meme coins was something I predicted years ago,” B said. He pointed out that Floki has now been focused on utility products to engage its audience that initially purchased the tokens as simply a meme.",

    "title": "Bitcoin Runes Protocol Sees Traction Waning After Much-Hyped Introduction",
    "detailedContent": "Activity on the Bitcoin Runes protocol has slowed over the past week, a sign it has failed to generate meaningful traction among users despite a stellar start last month. Runes takes the Ordinals protocol a step further by making transactions even cheaper and faster. Ordinals are a way to embed data into the Bitcoin blockchain by inscribing references to digital art into small Bitcoin-based transactions. The much-hyped Runes went live after Bitcoin’s fourth halving on April 20. Data tracked on Dune Analytics shows that in its first 10 days the protocol racked up more than 85,000 token issuances and generated over $3 million in fees. In the past two weeks, however, all the metrics – including fees, new Runes and user activity – have dropped more than 50%. Only some 5,000 new Runes have been issued since May 1, generating just under $100,000 in fees. At its peak, Runes led transactions and fees in the broader Bitcoin ecosystem, accounting for as much as 80% of all network activity. Now it\u0027s 20%. Worth noting, however, is that the downturn came amid a general market decline marked by falling bitcoin (BTC) prices and slow growth in alternative tokens, which may have contributed to a drop in sentiment for novel technology. Runes generated massive interest on social platform X before its launch with creator Casey Rodamor aiming to make it a protocol ripe for meme coin trading and “degen” traders. Some industry participants expected the protocol to mirror the flourishing meme coin ecosystem on blockchains such as Solana and Base – likely fueling interest and bets on little-known memes. PUPS, a Runes token, emerged as a big play and surged from under $10 million capitalization to over $150 million in under a week, gaining support from several noted traders such as BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes. Several NFT collections and tokens were launched on Ordinals, and even on Ethereum, before the protocol\u0027s introduction – each aiming to transfer over and become the biggest compilation after the launch. Such activity made Bitcoin-based NFTs top other collections on the usual leaders Ethereum and Solana, with tens of millions exchanging hands in an otherwise scant market for non-fungible tokens. Some skeptics say that while Runes may serve as a way to build the Bitcoin ecosystem, there’s still work to be done. \"The success of the Bitcoin L2 project based on OP_Return is doubtful as UTXO based blockchain network is fundamentally different from smart contract based network,\" Ho Chan Chung, head of marketing at CryptoQuant, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. \"The current notion of Bitcoin narrative as a digital currency combined, and the difference in the blockchain network fundamental are the two big hurdles that Bitcoin L2 projects need to overcome.\" \"Lightning network was able to prove it. However, Ordinals, BRC-20, and Runes all seemed to fail at winning the narrative for now.\" Chung added.",

Gill’s initial $53,000 investment was worth nearly $50 million at its peak, emerging as a rags-to-riches story of a lone trader making a fortune from his bedroom by betting against hedge funds.

    "detailedContent": "Bullish sentiment for riskier assets following soft inflation figures could propel bitcoin (BTC) prices toward the $74,000 mark in the coming days as institutional demand continues to grow, Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a note early Thursday. The softer-than-expected U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.3% versus 0.4% in March amid economist forecasts for 0.4%, triggering a breakout for BTC. The asset regained the $66,000 mark for the first time since April and posted its biggest single-day gain since March. Such a move, coupled with demand from traditional finance, could see bitcoin regaining its March record of $73,700. “We expect bullish momentum here that could take us back to the highs of nearly $74,000,” QCP traders said. “The desk saw sizeable buyers of $100K-$120k BTC Calls for Dec 2024 on this move higher in spot.” “Institutional demand for bitcoin continues to grow, with large asset managers Millennium and Schonfeld investing approximately 3% and 2% of their AUM into the BTC spot ETF,” they added. Multiple filings on Wednesday showed that several big-name funds, such as Millenium Management and Elliot Capital, held millions worth of bitcoin ETFs in their portfolios. Meanwhile, some analysts say the selling pressure on bitcoin appears to have eased off, citing on-chain and exchange data. “Short-term Bitcoin holders are selling at basically zero profit and traders are depleting their unrealized profits in the last few months,” CryptoQuant analysts shared in a Thursday report. “Bitcoin balances at OTC desks stabilizing, which suggests there is less Bitcoin supply coming into the market to sell via these entities.” The firm defines short-term traders as addresses that hold bitcoin for less than 155 days and are likely to capitalize on short-term price movements. A breakout in bitcoin comes after weeks of low volatility. Since March, the market has been range-bound between $60,000 and $70,000, with the halving event in April not providing the expected boost due to a general lack of market catalysts, traders have previously said. Higher risk appetite for token bets showed signs of beginning earlier this week after an X post by retail trader Keith Gill sent some meme stocks and meme coins surging. Gill\u0027s online persona and investment strategies contributed to a short squeeze on video game retailer GameStop’s stock in 2021, and his first post on social application X in three years was considered by some to be a sign of market volatility in the months ahead.",

    "title": "Bitcoin First, Not Only: Fostering Widespread Adoption Through Education",
    "detailedContent": "As bitcoin (BTC) continues to gain traction worldwide, the approach to introducing it to newcomers plays a crucial role in its widespread adoption. While some advocates firmly believe in a \"Bitcoin only\" narrative, this aggressive stance can often hinder the conversation and deter potential adopters. Instead, a \"Bitcoin first\" approach, which prioritizes education and understanding, may prove more effective in fostering genuine interest and long-term investment in bitcoin. Burak Tamac is an adjunct professor at Montclair State University, teaching politics and technology. This essay is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package published to coincide with the fourth Bitcoin “halving” in April 2024. Proponents of the \"Bitcoin only\" narrative often argue passionately for the superiority of bitcoin over other cryptocurrencies. However, this approach can come across as confrontational and off-putting to those who are new to the concept. When people feel attacked or told that their current investments are wrong, they are more likely to disengage from the conversation entirely. This is particularly true in countries like Turkey, where many individuals are already familiar with alternative investments like altcoins. To effectively promote bitcoin adoption, the focus should shift from telling people what to do to providing them with the knowledge to make informed decisions. By presenting bitcoin as the first step in understanding the broader cryptocurrency landscape, educators can help people grasp the unique features and advantages of bitcoin without disparaging other investments outright. When individuals learn about the Bitcoin network\u0027s decentralized nature, its limited supply and its potential as a store of value, they can better appreciate its significance. This foundation of knowledge allows them to evaluate other cryptocurrencies more critically and recognize the authenticity of bitcoin\u0027s value proposition. See also: Allen Farrington: Capital in the 21st Century | Opinion Encouraging people to blindly invest in bitcoin without proper understanding is a short-sighted approach. When individuals buy bitcoin solely based on hype or fear of missing out, they are more likely to panic sell during market fluctuations. This behavior not only harms their personal financial well-being but also discourages them to learn more about bitcoin. In contrast, when people invest in bitcoin after learning about its fundamentals and long-term potential, they are more likely to hold their investments through market cycles. This informed decision-making promotes stability and helps to build a stronger, more resilient Bitcoin community. To accelerate bitcoin adoption, I believe advocates should prioritize education to start a conversation; and the education should not start about what they do wrong, but what they can do more. By presenting bitcoin as the first step in a journey of financial literacy and technological understanding, we can create a more welcoming and inclusive environment for newcomers. By adopting a \"Bitcoin first\" approach that prioritizes education and understanding, we can create a more welcoming and empowering environment for newcomers. This shift in narrative, from \"Bitcoin only\" to \"Bitcoin first,\" has the potential to accelerate adoption.",

    "detailedContent": "Meme coins and artificial intelligence (AI)-linked tokens led gains in the past 24 hours as bitcoin and other major tokens started to reverse weekend losses. Bitcoin (BTC) added 3.3% to trade around $66,600 in European morning hours, buoyed by reports prospective ETF providers said they had been approved to offer bitcoin and ether exchange-traded funds in Hong Kong. Solana meme coins, dog-themed meme coins and Base network meme coins jumped over 15% on average, CoinGecko category data shows, while AI tokens zoomed over 17%. There was no apparent catalyst for the jumps. Tokens of layer-1 blockchains, such as ether (ETH), Solana’s SOL and Avalanche’s AVAX, were among the worst-performing categories, with an average rise of 5.5%. The broad-based CoinDesk 20, a liquid index of major tokens, minus stablecoins, rose nearly 6%. On-chain analysis tool Lookonchain said in an X post that whales, a colloquial term for wealthy traders whose actions can move token prices, picked up millions of dollars worth of meme tokens cat in a dogs world (MEW) and slerf (SLERF). Prices for the two rose almost 80% in the past 24 hours. Profit taking ahead of the halving, due later this week, and macroeconomic tremors weighed on the market since late Friday, with bitcoin dropping from last week’s highs around $70,500 to as low as $62,800. That caused a market-wide decline as majors dropped as much as 18%. As a result, $2 billion in futures positions were liquidated over the weekend, the most since March. Over $1.5 billion of those positions were betting on higher prices, data from analysis tool Coinalyze shows. A Coinalyze representative told CoinDesk in an X message that the leverage flush caused open interest – or the number of unsettled futures contracts – to drop $13 billion since Friday, indicative of bets being closed. Some traders said the price fall was expected ahead of the halving, a much-anticipated event on April 20 that will cut the rewards offered to network miners by half. “While previous halving events have historically been followed by 9-12 months of uptrend, they have often triggered short-term \u0027sell the news\u0027 reactions before and after the event,” Matteo Greco, a research analyst at digital asset investment firm Fineqia International, told CoinDesk in an email. “This short-term bearish sentiment is also reflected in the net outflow of $85 million from Bitcoin Spot ETFs during the week, signaling increased profit-taking and investor caution following the strong uptrend in both Q4 2023 and Q1 2024,” Greco added, referring to bitcoin ETF products in the U.S.",

    "detailedContent": "Bitcoin’s (BTC) much anticipated halving event later this month could see a flurry of bets on related networks and ecosystem tokens, with traders expecting upside on both technical and meme coin projects. Halving reduces the rate at which new coins are created and lowers the available new supply. The current block reward is 6.25 BTC, and it will drop to 3.125 BTC after the halving. This event has historically preceded a bull market for the token. Crypto traders say participants seek a “reason to buy” as money narratives continuously shift in the current bullish environment and they may turn their focus on the bitcoin ecosystem in the coming weeks. “There exists a large, untapped pool of capital within the Bitcoin ecosystem that remains dormant, and surprisingly few listed assets that traders can use to gain exposure to the narrative,” the OTC desk of trading firm Wintermute told CoinDesk over email. “Should capital begin to rotate into the Bitcoin ecosystem, tokens like $RUNE, $STX, and $ORDI could benefit significantly and outperform,” they added. THORChain’s RUNE and Stack’s STX have been among the top-performing tokens in the past year, CoinGecko data shows, tracking a bitcoin rise. Meme coin ordi (ORDI) – a nod to the Ordinals protocol on Bitcoin – has surged over 2,500% since its September issuance. Meanwhile, Bartosz Lipinski is the founder of the crypto trading platform Cube.Exchange said in an email that meme coins and the upcoming Runes protocol could rile up risky bets in the bitcoin ecosystem. “Ethereum’s high costs and significant network congestion will cause it to take a backseat as Bitcoin-based projects, like Rune, will redirect meme coin hype to the Bitcoin ecosystem because of the novelty,” Lipinski said. “The BRC-20 (Ordinals NFT) standard is likely to be overtaken by Runes, which is expected to launch on the day of the halving.” “Runes will aim to replace the standard with fungible tokens, which will enable the efficient creation of meme coins to compete with projects on Base and Solana,” he added, referring to the ongoing frenzy for non-serious tokens in the two ecosystems. Ordinals are a way to embed data into the Bitcoin blockchain by inscribing references to digital art into small Bitcoin-based transactions. Ordinal volumes were higher than those of usual leaders Ethereum and Solana in the past week, as reported, led by NodeMonkes and Pups. Non-fungible token (NFT) on other networks buying and selling activity declined 95% across all networks in the same period, suggestive of an isolated interest in Ordinals.",

    "detailedContent": "Money is flowing back into social application Friend.Tech as a new version teases an eventual airdrop, bringing users back to what was among the biggest revenue-generating platforms during the bear market. Over $7 million flowed to Friend.Tech last week after months of outflows, boosting the value locked to nearly $40 million, data shows. Weekly fees have crossed $1.3 million for the first time since November, making the platform over $600,000 in revenue. Built on Base, a layer-2 network, Friend.Tech lets crypto personalities on X issue “shares” for access to a closed group chat. For users, the allure of these chats is that their owners could offer trading insights, token picks or access to seed-funding deals – which raises the value of the shares. The bump in activity precedes the coming of version 2 of the application, which developers said will be released after April 20. A key element of the update is expanding the platform beyond X to attract newer users. Over the weekend, developers also teased a FRIEND token. Expectations among users are that these could be distributed based on how many points – a reward for Friend.Tech usage – they accumulate before the token release. Friend.tech was earning in excess of $1 million per day in fees at its August peak after going viral on X and gaining more than 100,000 unique users, a significant number for crypto application standards. Shares of some crypto X personalities, such as @Cobie and @HsakaTrades, jumped to as much as three ether, or nearly $5,000, at the time. Activity fell off in the months following as the initial allure wore off. Security risks later marred the platform alongside opportunities elsewhere in the sector, leading to months of outflows since November.",

    "title": "Bitcoin Cash Spikes 10% After Halving, Bitcoin Hovers Above $66K",
    "detailedContent": "Bitcoin Cash (BCH) surged 10% after completing its reward halving event, becoming one of the few gainers in an otherwise tepid market as bitcoin (BTC) – whose own halving occurs later this month – remained little changed over 24 hours. BCH changed hands at $660 in European morning hours, a price level not seen since December 2021. The token remains 80% below a lifetime peak of $3,700 set in December 2017. Bitcoin Cash’s block reward is now 3.125 BCH. Halving occurs when the reward for mining transactions is cut by 50%, reducing the rate at which new coins are created and thus lowering the available new supply. Bitcoin’s own halving is expected on April 20, trackers show, and has historically preceded a bull market for the token. The previous halving, in 2020, spurred a 1,000% run to a then-record high of $69,000 roughly a year and a half later. Read more: Bitcoin Halving, Explained Open interest on BCH-tracked futures swelled to $700 million earlier this week from below $200 million in March, showing an increase in leveraged bets on more expected price volatility, as previously reported. Meanwhile, crypto markets remained little changed in the past 24 hours amid the lack of market-moving catalysts. Bitcoin traded at just above $66,300, up 0.3% in the past 24 hours, and the CoinDesk 20, a broad-based liquid index of major tokens, excluding stablecoins, was down 0.7%. Ether (ETH), BNB Chain’s BNB and Solana’s (SOL) were up 1%, while dogecoin (DOGE), Polkadot’s DOT, XRP and Cardano’s ADA were down as much as 1.2%. Alex Kuptsikevich, a senior market analyst at FxPro, told CoinDesk in an email that the current lull was expected and traders were likely to be waiting for macroeconomic catalysts before making a move. “While Bitcoin\u0027s inability to rise is alarming, we saw a weaker dollar and stronger stock indices the day before, which is fuelling risk appetite,” Kuptsikevich said. “The cryptocurrency market\u0027s lagging performance can easily be attributed to accumulated overbought conditions and wariness ahead of the monthly labour market report,\u0027’ which is due tomorrow. “At the same time, we regard the current weakness as consolidation within the bull market, almost excluding the risks of a long-term reversal,” he said.",

    "title": "Why William Hinman`s Emails Matter to the XRP Army and the Crypto’s Price",
    "detailedContent": "On June 13, 2023, documents tied to William Hinman, the former director of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s Division of Corporation Finance from 2017 to 2020, were released to the public in connection with the SEC\u0027s lawsuit against Ripple, briefly sending the price of the XRP token up 7.4% as optimism spread that Ripple would win their ongoing case. Here’s why: Very broadly, Ripple and its partisans have argued that the Hinman emails could reveal a biased or flawed process behind the decision to publicly suggest in a 2018 speech by Hinman that Ethereum (ETH) may not be a security. One smoking gun might have been some sort of display of bias against Ripple and XRP, but the released emails do not mention either directly. Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty argued after the release that the emails showed Hinman ignoring warnings from colleagues that his speech was not grounded in law and created confusion about securities designations. At the very least, Alderoy seems to be suggesting Ripple has been treated unfairly by regulators. Early analysis of the emails does not seem to have found a major win for Ripple Labs, however. After a short rally on the morning of the emails’ release, XRP retraced its price and headed even lower, which may reflect some disappointment on this front. Ahead of the documents’ release, Ripple and XRP supporters had been focused on statements by Hinman suggesting that a token isn’t a security if it is “sufficiently decentralized.” That metric seems to have been used to justify a public carveout for Ethereum, but, at least according to feedback given to Hinman by other SEC staff and officials, was not grounded in existing securities regulation. Ripple has argued that XRP, like Ethereum, is “sufficiently decentralized” and should not be classified as a security according to the standards laid out by Hinman. Critics have long argued, however, that the underlying claim that Ethereum and XRP are comparably decentralized is itself highly debatable. Most significantly, there has now been close to a decade of debate and litigation over whether Ripple itself should be considered the creator of the XRP ledger and issuer of the XRP token – and therefore the issuer and seller of an unregistered security. Ripple Labs allies generally characterize the company as separate from XRP. In particular, they have argued that the XRP blockchain was created by Jed McCaleb and Chris Larsen, working as OpenCoin, before an entity called “Ripple” even existed. But OpenCoin became Ripple Labs and what is today simply called Ripple, and those cofounders “gifted” 80 billion XRP, 80% of the total supply, to Ripple Labs. Over the years, Ripple has made a variety of branding and messaging changes to represent that they are not the creators of XRP. That includes changing the preferred way to discuss the token itself, which for many years was commonly referred to as “Ripple.” Read More: What Is Ripple and the XRP Cryptocurrency? To critics such as Preston Byrne, this looks like an orchestrated deception, and one of the earliest instances of “decentralization theater.” And if XRP was effectively created or issued by Ripple, the parallel to Ethereum breaks down quickly, since Ethereum has no corporate for-profit parent. This could be a more compelling explanation for the different regulatory treatment of the two chains than bias or procedural failures. In any case, however the case develops and is ultimately decided, whenever new information is released that supporters believe bolsters or hurts Ripple\u0027s side of the case, XRP\u0027s price generally moves in parallel with the positive or negative sentiment.

    "title": "Binance Crypto Exchange: Your Questions Answered",
    "detailedContent": "Founded in 2017 by Changpeng Zhao, who is often referred to as just “CZ,” Binance is the world\u0027s leading cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume as of June 2023. The company was originally based in China but had to leave Shanghai due to regulatory restrictions shortly after its launch. Binance developed its own blockchain, Binance Smart Chain (later renamed to BNB Chain), which facilitates trades on the exchange. The native token of the blockchain is Binance coin (BNB) and the company has also launched a stablecoin, BinanceUSD (BUSD). Because of U.S. regulatory rules, Binance created a supposedly separate company for its U.S. clients in 2019, Binance.US. On June 5, 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed charges against Binance.US as well as CZ, who serves as Binance CEO, on allegations of violating federal securities laws by offering BNB and BUSD to the general public, calling them unregistered securities. The SEC lawsuit also casts fresh doubt on the independence of the company’s U.S. arm and its staking service. Read more about the SEC suit here This is not Binance’s first battle with U.S. regulators. Binance is also under ongoing scrutiny from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) who sued CZ and Binance in March 2023, alleging the company knowingly offered unregistered crypto derivatives products in the U.S. Here is everything you need to know about Binance, Binance.US and CEO Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao. CZ is a well-known personality in crypto, actively engaging with the crypto community through Twitter and speaking at conferences and to the media. As for his origins, he was born in China and emigrated to Canada when he was 12 and says he is a Canadian citizen. In high school, he worked part-time at McDonald’s, which is part of his well-known lore. He graduated from McGill University with a degree in Computer Science. After college, he worked for the Tokyo stock exchange and Bloomberg Tradebook developing software for the businesses. He then founded a startup in 2005, Fusion Systems, which focused on creating an automated high-frequency trading platform. Following that, he worked for several crypto startups including a stint as co-founder and CTO of OKCoin. Another piece of the CZ lore is that he first heard about Bitcoin at a poker game, which planted the seed that led him to create his own cryptocurrency exchange, Binance. According to the white paper, Zhao\u0027s goal for Binance was to compete with other exchanges by offering solutions to the numerous problems he saw with the cryptocurrency trading infrastructure – including poor technical architecture, insecure platforms, low market liquidity, poor customer support and poor language support. Shortly after Binance’s 2017 launch, Binance raised $15 million through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) for BNB, the terms of which were also laid out in the white paper. Binance started as one big company, founded in Shanghai in 2017. Because of China’s crackdown on crypto, the company left shortly after and while there were efforts to relocate the headquarters to Singapore and Malta was once thought to be Binance’s base, CZ currently claims that Binance has no headquarters and that wherever he is, that is where Binance is based. Binance also has a native coin, Binance Coin (BNB), which was initially launched on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token and subsequently migrated to Binance\u0027s proprietary blockchain, BNB Chain. BNB functions as an exchange token, meaning holders of BNB with Binance accounts can access discounted fees on the exchange. Binance created Binance.US in 2019 in response to regulatory requirements in the United States and notified customers that their accounts would be required to migrate to the new U.S-based exchange in November 2020. That said, many people noted that by using a VPN service, U.S.-based customers could still use Binance’s services. One of the biggest differences between the two exchanges is that Binance.com offers a much wider range of cryptocurrencies, with over 500 available for trading. Binance.US offers over 120 cryptocurrencies and is not available in all states as of writing, with Hawaii, New York, Texas, and Vermont blocking use of the exchange. The other big difference is that Binance.US does not offer margin trading or futures contracts, while Binance does. Both platforms offer low fees. Finally, unlike Binance’s stance that it has no headquarters, the U.S. arm is clearly based in Palo Alto, California. The SEC suit is specifically against Binance.US and Zhao and not the larger exchange. July 2017: Binance launches and raises $15 million through its BNB ICO. July 2018: Binance acquires Trust Wallet, a free, non-custodial mobile wallet to support its upcoming decentralized exchange (DEX) offering. January 2019: Binance starts to offer support for new token listings through ICOs (initial coin offerings) and IEOs (initial exchange offerings), through its Launchpad product. April 2019: Binance migrates BNB from Ethereum to its proprietary chain, then called Binance Smart Chain (now rebranded to Binance chain or BNB chain) April 2019: Binance launches its DEX ahead of schedule. May 2019: Binance gets hacked for the first time. Hackers steal over 7,000 bitcoin (BTC) from Binance (the equivalent of roughly $41 million at the time). Zhao quickly took to social media to reassure users that no one lost funds and that Binance used its reserve funds to cover the costs of the stolen crypto. CZ\u0027s \"Funds are #SAFU\" tweet has become a meme in the crypto space. June 2019: Binance announces it will launch a new trading platform for U.S. customers, in partnership with a firm called BAM Trading Services. July 2019: Binance hires former Ripple executive, Catherine Coley, to run its planned U.S. marketplace. September 2019: Binance launches its own dollar-backed stablecoin, BUSD in partnership with the Paxos Trust Company. September 2019: Binance.US launches in 37 states. The new marketplace supports six cryptocurrencies at launch: bitcoin, (BTC), ether (ETH), XRP, bitcoin cash (BCH), litecoin (LTC), tether (USDT) and BNB. BUSD is notably not supported at launch. April 2020: Binance buys CoinMarketCap, a cryptocurrency data provider, for a rumored $400 million, making it one of the biggest M\u0026A deals in crypto. “CoinMarketCap has more users than any other product in the crypto space,” Zhao said at the time. “It’s a very valuable platform.” September 2020: Binance rolls out Launchpool, a crypto staking platform. November 2020: Binance notifies U.S. customers they have a hard deadline of two weeks to migrate to the new platform before Binance shutters their accounts. April 2021: Binance.US hires Brian Brooks as CEO to replace Catherine Coley in the role. August 2021: Binance.US CEO Brian Brooks quits over “strategic differences” after just months in the job. September 2021: Binance.US promotes Brian Schroder to CEO; he formerly served as president and board member for the firm. April 2022: Binance.US raises $200 million in its first funding round, giving it a $4.5 billion valuation. September 2022: Binance announces it will stop supporting the second-largest stablecoin USDC and automatically convert customer funds to BUSD. October 2022: Binance suffers another major hack, and had to briefly halt trading on BNB after a “potential exploit” drained $100 million in crypto. October 2022: Binance confirms it has contributed $500 million towards Elon Musk’s bid to buy Twitter. November 2022: Amidst the collapse of FTX, there was a brief moment when Binance was going to buy the rival exchange. That deal quickly collapsed as the scope of FTX’s issues came to light. December 2022: Binance.US reaches an agreement to buy Voyager Digital\u0027s assets for just over $1 billion. Voyager, had gone into bankruptcy earlier in 2022 and originally had agreed to sell its assets to FTX, which folded itself. February 2023: BUSD issuer Paxos is hit with a one-two punch of an investigation by the New York Department of Financial Services and a Wells Notice from the SEC, which some believed hinted at Binance as a future target for the SEC. Following these actions, Paxos halted minting BUSD. March 2023: The CFTC sues CZ and Binance over allegations that the company offered unregistered crypto derivatives products. April 2023: Rumors of an Interpol “Red Notice” for CZ tank BNB price, but there is little to back up the claim. April 2023: Binance.US pulls out of a $1 billion deal to buy Voyager Digital’s assets, attributing the termination to the \"hostile and uncertain regulatory climate in the United States.\" June 2023: The SEC files charges against Binance.US and its founder Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao on allegations of violating federal securities laws with BNB token and Binance-linked BUSD stablecoin. The suit also alleges that Binance\u0027s staking service violated securities law as well as that the entities of Binance.US and Binance were not truly independent.",

    "title": "Crypto Options Liquidity Provider OrBit Markets Offers Bitcoin and Gold-Hybrid Derivative",
    "detailedContent": "Orbit Markets, an institutional liquidity provider of crypto options, is rolling out the first bitcoin and gold hybrid-focused derivative product with execution broker PI Digital. The initiative is among the latest developments among crypto industry firms to provide steady returns during periods of macroeconomic uncertainty. It aims to give investors exposure to gold and digital assets, two assets that hold their value. “This hybrid asset product is a perfect fit for investors that have experience in traditional assets such as gold and are now starting to dip their toes into digital assets,” OrBit Markets said in a press release. The derivative product, XAUT, is a gold-backed token issued by Tether. At maturity, the product will be settled in either USDT, XAUT or bitcoin as designated by OrBit, the Singapore-based company said. In its statement, OrBit noted that traditional financial service firms (TradFi) commonly offer hybrid products, including those combining stocks and commodity assets. The company said that investors “anticipating a sustained rally” in these two “safe haven” assets have risen amid growing concerns about the U.S. central bank’s hawkish monetary policy and resulting turmoil in the banking sector. “It\u0027s a dual option on both BTC and XAUT,” OrBit said, adding that investors could express “various sophisticated views” on bitcoin and the XAU token, including increases or decreases in returns for both, or if returns for one of the assets climbs but fall for the other. The \"worst-of put option\" allows investors to earn an enhanced yield if both assets appreciate. On the flip side, investors may be \"put\" into the worst performer should either asset fall, the liquidity provider said. In March, DeFi-focused asset management company MEV Capital used OrBit markets-issued options contracts to hedge liquidity providers’ positions and prevent losses in Uniswap (v3) liquidity pools. “OrBit aims to offer flexible solutions to our counterparties,” Pulkit Goyal, OrBit Markets VP of Trading adding that “OrBit plans to launch further hybrid products dedicated to institutional investors.”",

    "summary": "",
    "title": "What Is \u0027Web5\u0027 and How Is it Different From Web3?",
    "detailedContent": "The world is still getting its collective head around Web3 – a suite of decentralized protocols that add a (disputably) censorship-resistant financial layer to the internet. So why did Jack Dorsey, the creator of Web2 platform Twitter, skip right ahead to what he calls \"Web5\"? It turns out that, despite the name, Web5 does not follow the yet-to-be-created Web4. The Web5 platform, announced in June, 2022 by TBD, the crypto and decentralized finance arm of Dorsey’s payments company, Block (née Square), is firmly based on Web3 tech, but promises “an extra decentralized web platform.” To land on the name Web5, TBD just added Web3 (an internet powered by blockchain-based smart contracts) to Web2 (centralized content platforms, like Twitter or Facebook). Put simply: 3 + 2 \u003d 5. Web5’s core idea is to “put you in control of your data and identity” – a core tenet of Web3’s decentralized identity systems. Instead of inviting users to sign up for an account on a centralized platform (like an Instagram account), Web3 protocols reference users by their crypto wallet addresses. Protocols like the Ethereum Name Service let users turn their wallet’s garbled alphanumeric string into a word or phrase (like jane.eth) similar to how Domain Name Service (DNS) allowed websites to have addresses like coindesk.com rather than a long string of numbers like 54.235.191.121. Decentralized data storage is a concept already in existence and is provided by platforms like Filecoin and IPFS. Dorsey’s Web5 offers similar capabilities. Instead of an internet that relies on accounts provided by companies that hold customer data “captive in app silos,” Web5 pushes for “a new class of decentralized apps and protocols that put individuals at the center.” There are three pillars at Web5’s core: self-owned decentralized identifiers, verifiable credentials and decentralized web nodes for storing data and relaying messages. It sounds a lot like what decentralized identity services have been doing since the Ethereum Name Service launched in May 2017. So, what’s new here – apart from yet another stab at decentralized identities? Part of the answer may lie in Dorsey’s allegiance to bitcoin and his aggressive dismissal of Web3 culture. For Dorsey, bitcoin, launched in a truly decentralized fashion in 2009, is the only cryptocurrency that matters, the rest having been corrupted by venture capitalists who bent the platforms to their will. Accordingly, Web5 is run without any “special utility tokens or subjective consensus” that is part of the governance-token, decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)-controlled protocols like the Ethereum Name Service. In doing so, Web5 sounds like an attempt to rid Web3 of the centralized actors that Dorsey credits with sullying the mission of decentralization. Zion, a self-described Web5 app, uses Bitcoin’s base layer to help content creators work together with fans. But avoiding corruption is, of course, difficult: Web5’s nascent community already balked at TBD’s attempt to trademark the term Web5. The other thing that is different from Web3 is that Web5 works with existing Web2 services; it does not seek to replace them entirely. Web5’s pitch deck provides the example of Groove adding a playlist to a Web5 user’s decentralized identifier, which another music service, Tidal, can use to fashion its own playlists within the app. The decentralized identifier prevents the user from having to recreate their preferences on another platform. TBD’s other example of Web5 in action involves one user granting her hotel, airline and rental car provider the ability to add information to her database about her trip. The user can revoke access at any time and choose another service to “help her visualize her itinerary.” Again, the idea is to tie data that’s usually locked inside centralized services – something TBD calls “a massive, unworkable mess” – to a single user-controlled identity. Think of it as similar to how many sites and apps leverage a user’s Google account to log in, but in this case it will be a single login with a decentralized network of nodes. Will it work? Time will tell. So far, the only decentralized identity service that’s caught on in any measure is the Ethereum Name Service, and the only data storage system with any cachet is the interplanetary file service (better known as IPFS). One of the key things that distinguish TBD’s ambition is the backing of its billionaire progenitor, Jack Dorsey. But it’s unclear how Web5 would make money or why, ideological reasons aside, the company is creating such a service. Strategy consultant Adrien Book laid out the problem pretty well in a Medium post that followed Web5’s announcement: “Jack seems to want to keep the taste of Web3 without the calories. It’s like a high school student saying ‘yeah, but communism has never been REALLY tried as it’s meant to be.’ It’s naive.”",

    "title": "What Is DESK? CoinDesk’s Social Token, Explained",
    "detailedContent": "At CoinDesk, we’re not just chronicling the business model transformation that digital assets and the blockchain have made possible – we’re actively participating in it. At Consensus 2021, a virtual event, we beta-tested DESK, an experiment in using tokenized rewards to incentivize engagement and community-building, garnering positive feedback from our audience. At Consensus 2022, CoinDesk relaunched DESK as a full-fledged on-chain social token, making it a core part of the experience at our first live event since 2019. In December 2022, CoinDesk expanded the functionality of DESK to integrate the token into the broader user experience. Now, readers can earn DESK by reading articles, watching videos and more on CoinDesk.com. Read More: DESK Upgrade on CoinDesk’s Website Offers Tokenized Reader Experience Below is everything you need to know about DESK and how to use it. This post will be updated regularly as we build out the DESK program, so check back every so often for the latest information. DESK is CoinDesk’s social token. DESK is designed to build a community around the CoinDesk brand and to reward our audience for engaging with our content. DESK’s ethos is modeled on the founding principles of blockchain technology: openness, community, empowerment and innovation. We hope to use DESK to create a feedback loop with our users to help us build out an ecosystem together. As of this update, you can start earning DESK by creating an account at coindesk.com and engaging with our content, such as reading Consensus Magazine articles. Other ways to earn DESK include: At Consensus 2022, attendees were able to redeem DESK for such rewards as: DESK runs on Polygon, a sidechain, or parallel network, to Ethereum. Polygon helps us provide a gasless experience because of the lower costs per transaction. You’ll need to set up a cryptocurrency wallet that works with Polygon. MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet are the easiest ones to use for beginners. Read more: Get Started With DESK: How to Set Up Your Wallet Yes. With the new release in Dec. 2022, you will be required to have a coindesk.com account. In the Web2 era, content creators – be they writers, artists, filmmakers, publishers, media outlets or event organizers – have become beholden to the algorithms of intermediating platforms, complicating their efforts to directly reach and engage audiences. Simply put, the web ended up replacing one set of gatekeepers (major newspapers, magazines and television networks) with another (social media and search engines). We’re hopeful, like many others, that crypto and Web3 solutions involving tokens and new data and governance models will facilitate a more direct relationship with our audience and the expansion of a community of engaged participants that is independent of the platforms. We believe Consensus, which moves the content creator-audience relationship out of the digital realm and into a physical space where internet gatekeepers have less influence, is a great place to experiment with new tokens and incentive models in pursuit of this goal. We hope DESK generates a community that engages year-round in rich interaction with each other and with CoinDesk articles and other content and then comes back each year to gather in person at this cornerstone annual event. Social tokens allow for community-driven tech by creating a feedback loop between product creators and product users. This will allow the DESK team to get real-time data on engagement based on DESK usage, and use that data to iterate on the DESK ecosystem, aligning it more and more to user needs and wants. Initially, the blockchain provides us with data on DESK usage. The blockchain also discourages insider deals or under-the-table giveaways because the public ledger would lay bare any such misbehavior. This means everyone who claims NFTs or physical rewards had to put in the work (engaging with our content) to earn their reward. Simply put: DESK will be used to align our efforts as a media and events company to the wants and needs of our audience. No. DESK is not a currency, nor is it a financial asset or investment product of any kind. It is not for speculation and will not make anyone rich. This is not a vehicle for anyone’s savings nor is it a money-making opportunity. It is a reward token, analogous to airline frequent-flier miles, hotel guest points and the like. CoinDesk will be taking strong measures to discourage its use for speculation or trading. By providing a system where users can contribute to the functioning of a collective, digital system, the blockchain lays the foundation for a new type of organization: the tokenized community. We\u0027ve seen examples of this over the past few years with NFT communities and distributed autonomous organizations (DAO). To highlight this blockchain use case, we decided to focus on activating and expanding social utility to create community value, instead of focusing on monetization. No. DESK can only be earned as a reward for engaging with CoinDesk events and content, or as a tip from fellow users. No. See above. No. We\u0027re not selling the token at all, just distributing it to audience members as a reward for their engagement. Listing, buying or trading DESK is against our terms of use because we want the rewards and value to come from inside the ecosystem. We reserve the right to ban accounts and blacklist wallet addresses that violate our terms of use. It’s important to remember that not all blockchain assets are fully decentralized or claim to be so. Ether, the native currency of Ethereum, is completely user-controlled, but ERC-20 tokens built on top of the network may or may not be, depending on how the issuer designs it. For example, a number of regulated stablecoins are ERC-20 tokens, and their issuers have the power to freeze funds of suspect addresses to comply with law enforcement requests. So, no, DESK is not decentralized, nor does it purport to be. It is not competing with bitcoin or ether. Part of the value DESK provides is what CoinDesk injects into the ecosystem when we want to reward our users for engaging at a deeper level. This means being able to use your DESK to redeem food and drinks at establishments that CoinDesk partners with on the ground. No. The DESK ecosystem is 100% gasless. CoinDesk is covering the gas costs on Polygon. Because DESK has transitioned from testnet to mainnet, DESK collected in 2021 is no longer usable. That being said, we value the feedback and effort from DESK\u0027s beta testers. Piranhas are the fledgling community that formed around DESK during Consensus 2021. They started their own Discord channel and created memes about the token. The phenomenon was a clear validation for CoinDesk of the concept. At Consensus 2022, the official hub of the DESK community was CoinDesk’s Discord server, where we welcomed the Piranhas and newcomers alike. CoinDesk did, with the help of several key external partners, including Coinvise and others. As mentioned, MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet are easiest to use, but any wallet that works on Polygon can be used. Navigate to the DESK dashboard. Select \"Create or Connect Wallet\" and approve the transaction in your wallet. Depends. CoinDesk can associate identities with wallets only when users create accounts on desk.coindesk.com. We will not use this data for anything other than authenticating users when they sign on or distributing DESK rewards, we will never sell it, and we will protect user information assiduously. (See our privacy policy.) DESK transactions will appear on DESK\u0027s page on the Polyscan block explorer, but only the wallet addresses will be displayed.

    "title": "BlockFi’s Rise and Fall: A Timeline",
    "detailedContent": "Crypto lender BlockFi is kaput. The platform, which offered high yields on crypto deposits, has filed for bankruptcy protection. It’s the latest company to fall after the catastrophic collapse of FTX. Indeed, bankruptcy filings show that BlockFi had $355 million worth of cryptocurrencies frozen in FTX and relied on the firm for its credit facility. But how did it all go so wrong? CoinDesk has compiled a timeline to help you piece together the picture. Zac Prince and Flori Marquez founded BlockFi in October 2017 with a lofty mission: provide credit services to the cryptocurrency market. Prince, the CEO, had worked in sales before founding BlockFi. Marquez, the company’s chief operating officer, managed financial portfolios for Bond Street, a small-time lender that Goldman Sachs acquired in 2017, before founding BlockFi. The firm set up shop in Jersey City, New Jersey, and in subsequent years expanded to New York, Singapore, Poland and Argentina. In January 2018, BlockFi launched its first offering: loans of U.S. dollars backed by cryptocurrencies. Simply, clients could deposit bitcoin (BTC) or ether (ETH) and take out loans in fiat against that crypto collateral. Venture capital money followed swiftly. In February 2018, BlockFi raised $1.55 million in a seed round led by ConsenSys Ventures. In July 2018, it raised a hefty $52.5 million in a funding round led by Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital. And at the end of 2018, BlockFi raised another $4 million by issuing convertible notes, with Akuna Capital the main buyer. Flush with cash, the startup got to work. In March 2019 it launched a crypto deposit account that would reinvest earnings from bitcoin or ether deposits and provide an opportunity to earn compound interest at a 6.2% annual percentage yield (APY). BlockFi adjusted these rates over time; oin May 2019 it almost halved the interest rate on ETH deposits. The risk of the high-interest account, as explained to CoinDesk, was that it \"doesn’t come with the backing of the federal government like a savings account at a bank does.” As the market heated up over the next few years and BlockFi continued to grow, that didn’t seem to hold people back from depositing their money with the company. The firm’s next huge cash injection came in August 2019, when BlockFi raised $18.3 million in a Series A funding round led by Peter Thiel’s Valar Ventures. They were joined by Winklevoss Capital, Galaxy Digital, ConsenSys, Akuna Capital and others. Earlier that year, BlockFi reached a milestone of having over $50 million deposited in its interest-bearing accounts. In December 2019, BlockFi got into the crypto trading game, offering an unusual model that charged zero fees on purchases and sales. Instead of charging trading fees, BlockFi profited by selling trading data to institutional crypto firms that, in turn, provided liquidity to BlockFi, similar to Robinhood’s business model. “Market makers want the information about what trades are happening, and they get it by having relationships with as many venues as they can support to receive that order flow,” BlockFi’s CEO said. Peter Thiel’s Valar Ventures led BlockFi’s $30 million Series B funding round in February 2020, with repeat investors including Akuna Capital and new investors including HashKey Capital, which CEO Prince noted as key to helping “BlockFi expand into Singapore” and the Asia-Pacific region. BlockFi partnered with Silvergate Bank to allow customers to utilize cash deposits via wire transfer to buy bitcoin. Prior to the move, BlockFi was limited to “crypto payment rails” such as stablecoins. Prince said he had been inundated by “requests every day from our existing clients, and also from folks who aren\u0027t already cryptocurrency owners.” The company disclosed the previous month it had $650 million of assets on its platform. All was going well. Then: a hack! In 2020, a single attacker targeted an employee’s phone with a “SIM swap” that tricked the mobile carrier into activating the employee’s phone on another device. This allowed the hacker to gain access to some of BlockFi’s retail marketing systems. No funds were lost, but the attacker managed to access confidential information about BlockFi’s customers. In August 2020, BlockFi raised $50 million in a Series C round led by Morgan Creek Digital. At the time, Zac Prince said the lender held $1.5 billion in assets and made a little under $10 million in revenue each month. National Basketball Association star Matthew Dellavedova was among the investors. In October 2020, BlockFi invested big into Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (Grayscale is owned by CoinDesk\u0027s parent, Digital Currency Group), taking a 5% stake of the $4.8 billion fund. The other big whale invested in GBTC at the time? Hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, which had a 6% stake as of June 2020. BlockFi continued to expand its stake in GBTC, to $1.7 billion in GBTC by February 2021. Unfortunately, it later turned out that it was difficult to get money out of GBTC. In addition, as of writing, shares in the trust trade at a huge discount to bitcoin. Early in 2021, BlockFi registered its own Bitcoin Trust with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, putting it in direct competition with Grayscale’s product. The fund offered a lower management fee and partnered with Fidelity Digital Asset Services to custody the assets. In November of that same year, it filed for approval for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund. All was going well for BlockFi. With bitcoin’s soaring price hitting all-time highs (bitcoin crossed the $60,000 mark for the first time in March 2021), BlockFi raised $350 million, giving the company a valuation of $3 billion. It held $15 billion in assets and aimed to increase its staff to 500 people by the end of the year. It said it had 225,000 users, up from 10,000 in late 2019. What could go wrong? New Jersey’s Bureau of Securities was the first to deliver a big blow. The state’s financial regulator claimed BlockFi’s interest accounts amounted to sales of an “unregistered security” and issued a ban on creating new interest-bearing accounts. Alabama issued its own notice to the lender shortly after, and Texas joined on the same day. Two days later, Vermont lodged its complaint, and at the end of the month Kentucky ordered the lender to stop signing up new interest account customers. The CEO called on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to look into the matter. So the national securities regulator did exactly that – and it didn’t end well for BlockFi (we’ll get to that next). It was poor timing for BlockFi, which was looking to raise $500 million in a Series E and was launching a Visa rewards credit card. In February, BlockFi settled with the SEC for $100 million over its high-yield lending product. It registered with the SEC, but from mid-February stopped offering the interest account to new clients in the U.S., and prevented existing U.S. clients from adding more money to their accounts. “Today’s settlement makes clear that crypto markets must comply with time-tested securities laws,” SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a statement. In June, BlockFi’s valuation sank to $1 billion in a “down round” – a third of its $3 billion valuation the previous March, when it raised $350 million. At the end of June, the lender held $1.8 billion in open loans and $600 million of exposure. In particular, BlockFi had made huge loans to the huge crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, which officially filed for bankruptcy protection on July 1. Three Arrows had failed after being overexposed to the collapsed stablecoin ecosystem, Terra; BlockFi, according to reports, had liquidated the hedge fund\u0027s collateral before its bankruptcy. In the same month, bitcoin fell below $20,000. A month later, BlockFi’s main rivals, Voyager Digital and Celsius Network, also filed for bankruptcy protection. In dire straits, BlockFi received a $400 million line of credit from crypto exchange FTX later that summer. The exchange also won the right for its U.S. unit to buy BlockFi FTX US almost bought the lender for just $25 million, and in August could have bought the company for as little as $15 million if certain key terms weren’t met, such as receiving SEC clearance to operate its yield-generating services in the U.S. At the start of the month, FTX itself collapsed after CoinDesk published a story based on private financial documents on Nov. 2 that poked holes in the balance sheet of FTX sister company, trading firm Alameda Research. It took only nine more days for FTX to completely melt down, and it went to bankruptcy court on Nov. 11. That was bad for BlockFi, which needed FTX’s credit facility to remain afloat. Late on Nov. 10, BlockFi paused customer withdrawals amid “the lack of clarity” about FTX. On Nov. 11, California’s financial regulator revoked BlockFi’s lending license. BlockFi started preparing for its bankruptcy filing shortly after that. On Nov. 28, it officially filed for protection under Chapter 11, leaving over 100,000 creditors in the lurch. Filings later revealed that Alameda had defaulted on $680 million worth of loans to BlockFi. After filing in the bankruptcy court, BlockFi sued Sam Bankman-Fried\u0027s Emergent Fidelity Technologies for its Robinhood shares, which were pledged to BlockFi as collateral for a loan. In the first bankruptcy hearing, lawyers for BlockFi said the lender held $355 million in crypto on FTX. All the while, one question looms: Will customers get anything back?

    "title": "What Are \u0027Fully Backed\u0027 Reserves?",
    "detailedContent": "Regular banks do not actually hold all of your money. They lend out most of your deposits in an attempt to eke out returns from financial markets. This works, for the most part, because the bank insures deposits with the federal government and because the bank widely diversifies its exposure to risk to ensure that it won’t be caught short in the event of a financial crash. This system occasionally fails in traditional finance (see: Lehman) but fails frequently in crypto. The government does not insure deposits to crypto platforms and the platforms often do not manage risk particularly well (see: FTX, Voyager Digital, Celsius Network), making high-risk bets that end in catastrophe. Read More: Proof of Reserves: Could it Have Prevented the FTX Meltdown? After so many platforms squandered customer funds, crypto traders are thinking twice about depositing funds to crypto exchanges and lending institutions that “rehypothecate” uninsured deposits – which means they repurpose customer money and lend the funds out in the markets. A safer bet looks like trading on platforms that “fully back” their reserves. But what does this really mean, and should such claims be taken with a pinch of salt? When a financial product, such as a stablecoin or depositary institution, claims to “fully back” its reserves, it means that it has stored enough money behind a product, like a stablecoin or a customer’s trading account, to support its worth. So, a crypto exchange that “fully backs” its reserves should always be able to pay out customer withdrawals, no matter the state of the market. One such example is Coinbase, which does not lend out its customers’ funds without their express permission, meaning it should always have enough money on hand to prevent a bank run. A stablecoin that “fully backs” its reserves is always able to fulfill conversions to the original asset, no matter what. One example is wBTC, or wrapped bitcoin, which holds real bitcoin (BTC) in a cold wallet, then issues an equal amount of an Ethereum-based version of the coin that trades as an ERC-20 token. Fully backed, however, does not necessarily mean that assets are held one to one. That claim refers to the idea that if you, say, give me a dollar, I’ll hold that dollar as a dollar and won’t turn it into something else. Lots of stablecoins that claim to be fully backed, like U.S.-dollar stablecoin USDC, are not backed one to one. This is because the companies that issue USDC hold the deposits of real U.S. dollars in “cash and cash equivalents.” Cash equivalents refer to U.S. Treasury bonds, which is debt issued by the U.S. Treasury Department. These bonds, which pay small returns to holders over time, are close enough to the worth of actual U.S. dollars that the market accepts bonds being essentially worth the same. But “fully backed” does not always mean that the backing can withstand financial shocks. U.S. dollar stablecoin tether (USDT) also claims that its reserves are fully backed, but this backing is secured by “other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether [the issuing company] to third parties.” So, USDT may be fully backed, but it is partially backed by loans to other crypto companies. Until October 2022, USDT was also backed by commercial paper – short-term commercial debt to other companies – and moved those funds to U.S. Treasurys. The concern about the commercial paper was that nobody knew which companies Tether was using to back USDT, so it was impossible to determine the worth of that backing. What’s more, its “fully backed” claim has historically turned out not to be true after it emerged in 2019 that USDT was, at one point, only 74% backed. As wrote the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u0027s Dawn D. Stump, the claim that it was backed to the U.S. dollar was “not 100% true, 100% of the time.” Read more: What Is Tether? How USDT Works and What Backs Its Value Some stablecoins do not fully back their reserves, which has led to catastrophic results in some cases. The popular algorithmic stablecoin UST, for instance, crashed in spectacular fashion, wiping billions from the market. On the opposite end of the spectrum, U.S. dollar stablecoin DAI overcollateralizes its reserves with crypto, meaning it has more than enough crypto on hand to back its coin. DAI has survived several market crashes. ",

    "detailedContent": "The exchanges that want to list and trade shares of spot ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds are abruptly being asked by regulators to update key filings related to these products. Exchanges are being asked to update 19b-4 filings on an accelerated basis by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, three people familiar with the situation told CoinDesk, suggesting they may be moving to approve these applications ahead of a key deadline this Thursday. That doesn\u0027t mean the ETFs will be authorized, though. Would-be issuers also need their S-1 applications approved before the products could begin trading. SEC could take an indefinite amount of time to approve the S-1 documents, one person familiar with the matter said, as it isn\u0027t tied to a deadline. One company in talks with the SEC said it feels like it might be on the right track for approval, in a turnaround from feeling some weeks ago that the SEC was dragging its feet, according to a person familiar with the matter. Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart raised their odds for the approval of a spot ether ETF to 75% from 25% on Monday after hearing chatter that the SEC could be taking a more favorable stance towards the applications. They later corrected their statement, saying that the odds were related to the 19b-4 approvals. The SEC is expected to make a decision on VanEck spot ether ETF on May 23rd. The SEC has been investigating whether ether, the chief native asset to the Ethereum blockchain, is a security, launching a formal inquiry after the network moved from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake mechanism. If ether is deemed to be a security by the SEC, that may be one reason for the regulator to reject the spot ether ETF applications. One test of the agency\u0027s view on whether ETH is a security has newly emerged at Prometheum. The special purpose broker announced Monday it had soft-launched its ether custody service. The company eventually intends to launch custody and trading services for other digital assets – importantly, assets that are treated as securities in the U.S., not commodities.

    "detailedContent": "A Monday rally during the U.S. trading day put an end to what had been very muted crypto price action over the previous 72 hours, pushing bitcoin (BTC) above $68,000 for the first time in more than five weeks. At press time, the world\u0027s largest crypto was changing hands at $68,250. Leading the rally in crypto was Solana\u0027s (SOL), which has gained 7% over the past 24 hours, also to more than a five-week high. That outperformed both bitcoin\u0027s 2.6% advance and the CoinDesk 20\u0027s 2.8% rise. Read more: Solana\u0027s SOL Could Hit $200 By Month End, Hedge Fund Founder Says The turnaround in the recent downward price action came last week after the government reported softer-than-forecast April inflation data and quarterly institutional filings showed interesting participation in the spot bitcoin ETFs from the Wisconsin state pension board and a number of heavy-hitting hedge funds. Bitcoin rallied from just above the $60,000 to more than $66,000 by week\u0027s end. Alongside that rally came a renewal of big inflows into the spot bitcoin ETFs, which had previously witnessed net outflows over four of the previous seven weeks. All told, the spot funds added 14,389 bitcoin last week, according to HODL Capital, the strongest performance since March. Earlier Friday, Grayscale, the manager of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), announced the exit of CEO Michael Sonnenshein, who will be replaced by Goldman Sachs executive Peter Mintzberg. The move suggests Grayscale may have its eyes on a return to growing assets for GBTC as opposed to the current slow bleed of bitcoin from its holdings.",

    "title": "Will RFK Jr. Debate Trump or Biden? Probably Not, Prediction Market Says",
    "detailedContent": "This week in prediction markets… A presidential debate that includes independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. alongside President Biden or Republican frontrunner Donald Trump is unlikely to happen, bettors on crypto-based predictions platform Polymarket are signaling. \"Yes\" shares in the contract are trading at 27 cents, meaning the market sees a 27% chance of it occurring. Each share pays out $1 if the prediction comes true, and zero if not. The machinations of the American political-industrial complex make it difficult for a third party, or independent candidate, to succeed. Ballot access laws favor major parties, creating significant barriers for third-party candidates. Getting on a debate stage has another high threshold of its own. Rules for the first debate, scheduled for June 27 on CNN, say that the candidates must appear on enough state ballots to hypothetically reach 270 electoral votes, and also receive 15% in four polls. A second debate on ABC is scheduled for September, and it also has a 15% polling rule. Currently, RFK Jr. is polling at just under 10% in national polls compiled by 270toWin. Right now his team says they have confirmed ballot access, or are working on it, in enough states to win 201 electoral votes, which is enough to be a spoiler, but not to win the presidency. But independent candidates have participated in the debates in living memory: in 1992, independent candidate H. Ross Perot appeared on stage alongside George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton. To be clear, the Polymarket contract says that RFK Jr. must participate in a debate including Trump or Biden. It doesn\u0027t say that the debate must be an official one. Trump\u0027s campaign wants more debates, according to reports, proposing one per month from June to September, preferring two-hour stand-up debates in larger venues with live audiences. The current train of thought holds that RFK Jr.\u0027s campaign is more of a threat to Biden than Trump\u0027s, and polls that include him give Trump a slight edge, up to 5 points in some. It\u0027s plausible that the Trump campaign could decide to host a streaming debate with the Kennedy campaign, or hold it on a lesser-known network like OANN. It just needs to be a \"publicly broadcast debate\" per Polymarket\u0027s rules. (Don\u0027t forget that Kennedy is coming to CoinDesk\u0027s Consensus conference, taking the stage on May 31 at 4:30 PM) Sora, OpenAI\u0027s text-to-video generator, wowed the world when Sam Altman\u0027s company demoed the project back in February. Missing is a launch date. Bettors on Kalshi, a U.S.-regulated platform, are predicting that launch will take place sometime between September and the end of 2025, with only a 27% chance it will occur before September. But there\u0027s one thing that\u0027s getting in the way of a wide release of Sora: the availability of high-end graphics processing units (GPUs). Rendering video from text prompts is going to take a lot of them, more, in fact, than many of the world\u0027s largest customers of Nvidia have in their data centers. According to a report by Factorial Funds, OpenAI\u0027s Sora faces significant challenges regarding GPU availability, as mainstream adoption of text-to-video generation would require hundreds of thousands of server-grade GPUs at a cost of tens of billions. Factorial estimates that supporting the creator community of platforms like TikTok and YouTube alone would necessitate around 720,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs, far exceeding the combined resources of major tech companies like Microsoft, Meta, and Google. But remember, the contract isn\u0027t asking if Sora will be widely available. A launch with limited availability and a high monthly cost would still count. It\u0027s just asking if it will launch. Punters on Polymarket aren’t expecting any of the best-known cat meme coins to become the first such token to reach the $1 billion market cap milestone. A market capitalization bet for cat-themed tokens, which some expect to flip their dog-themed counterparts in the next bull cycle, has racked up $1.2 million in bets since going live in March. As of Monday, popular tokens Popcat (POPCAT) and cat in a dogs world (MEW) have 22% and 7% odds, while shark cat (SC) and toshi (TOSHI) have odds of under 2%. Despite all these memes being valued at over $200 million and occupying massive mindshare in the meme coin community, punters aren’t expecting any of these to become the first billion-dollar cat meme. Instead, the “others/none in 2024” category dominates the odds at 68%. Other cat-themed tokens in the open market but not referenced in the Polymarket contract are mog (MOG), wen (WEN) and maneki (MANEKI), according to CoinGecko. The high odds for two distinct outcomes suggest traders either expect a whole other cat meme to become the biggest or expect no single token in the category to get such a rich valuation. The apparent bearish sentiment is likely not due to the lack of buying pressure, either. Two dog tokens, bonk (BONK), dogwifhat (WIF), and the frog-themed pepe (PEPE), were launched in 2023 and zoomed to over $3 billion each in less than a year, showcasing the demand for such tokens. Among meme coin hunters, the perceived cuteness of a meme drives its virality and, ultimately, price. So which is cuter: a dog with a pink beanie hat or a cat with a mouth that pops? The punters have decided. A market betting on Solana fees flipping those of Ethereum has fallen 12 points in the past week, after jumping up to 35% earlier in the month. The “Solana flips ETH in daily fees in May?” market, which has seen over $60,000 in wagers placed, is a market on whether the daily fees of Solana (SOL) will surpass that of Ethereum (ETH) for any day within this market’s time frame from May 10 to May 31. Odds of the flip rose earlier this month due to a revival of meme coin trading as GameStop stock prices surged higher, aiding growth in meme tokens. However, the odds fell following a $2 million exploit on Pump.Fun, a tool that lets anyone deploy a tradeable token on Solana. The brief exploit may have been expected by some to slow the rapid issuance of meme coins on Solana, which would in turn depress daily fees. Despite being extremely cheap compared to Ethereum, the Solana blockchain collects millions of dollars in fees every day thanks to the sheer magnitude of meme coin trading activity on the network. Still, the fee difference isn’t a big one. Blockchain activity on Ethereum netted it over $1.84 million in the past 24 hours, while it was nearly $1.2 million for Solana, DefiLlama data shows. Pump.Fun has since come back online, and is seeing thousands of new memes launched daily as usual. Peruse it at your risk.",

    "detailedContent": "The exchanges that want to list and trade shares of spot ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds are abruptly being asked by regulators to update key filings related to these products. Exchanges are being asked to update 19b-4 filings on an accelerated basis by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, three people familiar with the situation told CoinDesk, suggesting they may be moving to approve these applications ahead of a key deadline this Thursday. That doesn\u0027t mean the ETFs will be authorized, though. Would-be issuers also need their S-1 applications approved before the products could begin trading. SEC could take an indefinite amount of time to approve the S-1 documents, one person familiar with the matter said, as it isn\u0027t tied to a deadline. One company in talks with the SEC said it feels like it might be on the right track for approval, in a turnaround from feeling some weeks ago that the SEC was dragging its feet, according to a person familiar with the matter. Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart raised their odds for the approval of a spot ether ETF to 75% from 25% on Monday after hearing chatter that the SEC could be taking a more favorable stance towards the applications. They later corrected their statement, saying that the odds were related to the 19b-4 approvals. The SEC is expected to make a decision on VanEck spot ether ETF on May 23rd. The SEC has been investigating whether ether, the chief native asset to the Ethereum blockchain, is a security, launching a formal inquiry after the network moved from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake mechanism. If ether is deemed to be a security by the SEC, that may be one reason for the regulator to reject the spot ether ETF applications. One test of the agency\u0027s view on whether ETH is a security has newly emerged at Prometheum. The special purpose broker announced Monday it had soft-launched its ether custody service. The company eventually intends to launch custody and trading services for other digital assets – importantly, assets that are treated as securities in the U.S., not commodities.

    "detailedContent": "Michael Sonnenshein, CEO of digital asset investment firm Grayscale, has stepped down after 10 years to be replaced by a veteran from the world of traditional finance (TradFi) world just months after the company\u0027s flagship Bitcoin Trust became an exchange-traded fund (ETF). Sonnenshein, who became CEO in 2021, will be replaced by Peter Mintzberg, head of strategy for asset and wealth management at Goldman Sachs on Aug. 15, Grayscale said on Monday. Mintzberg has more than 20 years of experience in TradFi, having previously worked at BlackRock, OppenheimerFunds and Invesco. CFO Edward McGee will lead the company on an interim basis until Mintzberg fills the role. \"Michael guided the firm through exponential growth \u0026 oversaw its pivotal role in bringing spot bitcoin ETFs to market, leading the way for the broader financial industry,\" Barry Silbert, CEO of Grayscale\u0027s parent company Digital Currency Group, wrote on X. In January, Grayscale was one of about a dozen firms to finally have a spot bitcoin ETF approved to list in the U.S. in January. The firm had taken the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to court over the regulator\u0027s repeated refusal to allow it to convert its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), then a closed-end fund, into an ETF. GBTC saw around $15 billion of outflows in the following three months as the firm kept fees higher than its competitors.

    "title": "How MIT Brothers Allegedly Cheated a Noxious-But-Accepted Ethereum Practice for $25M",
    "detailedContent": "They had it all planned out. In late 2022, the brothers Peraire-Bueno – twenty-something graduates of Massachusetts Institute of Technology who had turned their sights on blockchain – embarked on an effort that ultimately netted them $25 million, in one of the most sophisticated exploits in a decade or so of frequent crypto exploits. At the outset, according to U.S. prosecutors, they outlined a four-step plan. First there was \"The Bait.\" Then there was \"Unblinding the block,\" followed by \"The Search,\" and ultimately \"The Propagation.\" \"In the months that followed, the defendants followed each stage as outlined in their Exploit Plan,\" according to an indictment. The U.S. Department of Justice on Wednesday charged two brothers, Anton Peraire-Bueno, 24, and James Peraire-Bueno, 28, for exploiting a vulnerability in a popular software program used by trading bots on the Ethereum blockchain, netting an estimated $25 million of gains during a 12-second exploit in April 2023. Their father is Jaime Peraire, the former head of MIT\u0027s department of aeronautics and astronautics, CNBC reported. The exploit happened thanks to a vulnerability that the brothers discovered in MEV-boost, a piece of software used by roughly 90% of the validators that run the blockchain, allowing them to see the transactions in blocks before they were officially sent off to validators. MEV, or maximal extractable value, is sometimes known as an “invisible tax” that validators and builders can collect from users by reordering or inserting transactions in a block before they’re added to the blockchain. Sometimes the practice is compared with frontrunning in traditional stock markets, but due to the difficulty of eradicating it completely, the Ethereum community has more or less accepted the practice, and simply tried to minimize the deleterious effects. One of those mitigating strategies is through the use of MEV-Boost, a software program used by roughly 90% of Ethereum validators. The idea is that all comers could earn MEV more equitably. Such a this-is-just-how-it\u0027s-done attitude was explicitly acknowledged by the prosecutors in their charging document. \"Tampering with these established MEV-Boost proposals, which are relied upon by the vast majority of Ethereum users, threatens the stability and integrity of the Ethereum blockchain for all network participants,\" according to the indictment. On Ethereum, users submit transactions that are added to a \"mempool” – an area where transactions are in a holding pattern. MEV-boost lets \"block builders\" assemble those mempool transactions from the mempool and put them into blocks. Then, MEV bots, or \"searchers,” look into the mempool and assess which transactions could make profitable trades, and sometimes bribe those block builders to rearrange or insert certain transactions to squeeze out some extra profits. Ethereum validators then take those blocks from MEV-boost and ink them to the chain, where they become irreversible. All these steps are typically executed automatically by the software in fractions of seconds. What the Peraire-Bueno brothers did in this case was target three MEV bots who didn’t have certain checks in place, and set up 16 validators designed to entice the bots. When the searchers bundle transactions together, they have a target transaction, a signed transaction before it, and a signed transaction after. “The rules of the game are, ‘Well, I give you this bundle, and the bundle has to execute atomically,’ meaning it will only go if all three transactions are included in exactly this order, and any other thing than that, it\u0027s not going to work,” Matt Cutler, the CEO of Blocknative, a blockchain infrastructure firm, told CoinDesk in an interview. Because the brothers set up malicious validators, their intent was always to seize on the opportunity to exploit the bots that did not have those checks, by pulling apart those transactions. “Because the honeypot transactions were very lucrative, and the bots didn\u0027t have checks in place to prevent certain conditions from happening, and they fundamentally trusted the integrity of the validator and MEV-boost ecosystem, the malicious validator got access to signed transactions that were secured and they were then able to manipulate those signed transactions to drain the bots of $25 million of funds,” Cutler said. In its allegations, the government went out of its way to demonstrate that the activities – targeting a crucial juncture of the blockchain\u0027s inner workings, at a level that\u0027s technical even for experienced blockchain developers – diverged from the community norms, and into the realm of fraud. Specifically, the brothers were accused of sending a \"false signature\" in lieu of a valid digital signature to a crucial player in the chain known as a \"relay.\" A signature is needed to reveal the contents of a proposed block of transactions – including all of the potential profits contained inside the bundle. \"In this process, a relay acts in a manner similar to an escrow account, which temporarily maintains the otherwise private transaction data of the proposed block until the validator commits to publishing the block to the blockchain exactly as ordered,\" the prosecutors wrote. \"The relay will not release the transactions within the proposed block to the validator until the validator has confirmed through a digital signature that it will publish the proposed block, as structured by the builder, to the blockchain.\" Based on their research and planning, the prosecutors alleged, the brothers \"knew that the information contained in the false signature was designed to, and did, trick the Relay to prematurely release the full content of the proposed block to the defendants, including the private transaction information,\" according to the indictment. As Cutler put it, “Stealing is stealing, regardless of the terms that enable that stealing.” “Just because your car door is unlocked, doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s okay to break into your car, right?” he said. Ethereum is often susceptible to some controversial MEV trading practices, like front-running and so-called sandwich attacks. But many leading figures in the MEV ecosystem view the exploit that took place last year as pure theft. Taylor Monahan, a lead product manager at MetaMask, wrote on X that “Yes, if you steal and launder $25 million dollars you should expect to go to prison for a long time lmfao.” “It’s a little bit robbing the robbers you could arguably say, but regardless it was clearly an exploit, a manipulation of rule sets, in a manner that is seen to be in violation of established laws of the jurisdiction, right,” Cutler said. Almost to underscore the point, the government alleged that in the weeks following the exploit, Anton Peraire-Bueno \"searched online for, among other things, \u0027top crypto lawyers,\u0027 \u0027how long is us statue [sic] of limitations,\u0027 \u0027wire fraud statute / wire fraud statute [sic] of limitations,\u0027 \u0027fraudulent Ethereum addresses database\u0027 and \u0027money laundering statue [sic] of limitations.\u0027\" The prosecution also noted that the day after the exploit, James Peraire-Bueno emailed a bank representative asking “for a safe deposit box that was large enough to fit a laptop.” Read more: Brothers Accused of $25M Ethereum Exploit as U.S. Reveals Fraud Charges",

    "title": "The Protocol: Lido Backers vs EigenLayer",
    "detailedContent": "I must admit to choking on my tequila drink a couple weeks ago after hearing the phrase \"investable asset class\" applied to the category of digital tokens known as meme coins. But for many investors and projects, the opportunity is being taken quite seriously. See our riff below. ALSO: This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Also please check out our weekly The Protocol podcast. MEME RUSH! An industry source told me over margaritas a few weeks ago, \"You\u0027re starting to hear venture capital firms make the argument that meme coins are becoming an investable asset class.\" What\u0027s undeniable is that meme coins are popping, and there does appear to be a thriving industry in promoting them. In April alone, CoinMarketCap added 138 meme coins to its listings, versus 18 in the same month a year earlier, bringing the total to 2,229, with a market capitalization of more than $50 billion, as reported by our Omkar Godbole. Last week, VanEck, a crypto-friendly institutional investment firm, started a new Meme Coin Index, tracking prices of doggy-themed tokens dogecoin (DOGE) and dogwifhat (WIF) as well as other ridiculousness like BONK. Another dog token, FLOKI, shared the title sponsorship for a cricket series between Pakistan and Ireland. Crypto analysts are talking up the election-related meme coins TRUMP and BODEN, and tokens associated with the X-Men character Wolverine flooded several blockchains after TheRoaringKitty, the personality behind the GameStop meme stock frenzy, posted a related video on X. Even independent Bitcoin programmer Jimmy Song, often a vocal critic of non-Bitcoin token creation, wrote in a Substack post that he appreciated the \"honesty\" of the movement: \"Meme coins obsoleted the VCs and ultimately brought some more honesty to the Nietzschean will-to-power games that were always being played.\" Speaking of Bitcoin, the OG blockchain now has meme coins too, many of them created with the Runes protocol launched last month. Sovryn, a decentralized trading platform with Ethereum-compatible smart contracts and secured by Bitcoin through merge-mining on the Rootstock sidechain, announced Wednesday that it has created a fully-premined rune called POWA, airdropped the tokens to users and established pools for trading them. \"Runes provide a way for projects to create and distribute tokens natively on the Bitcoin blockchain for memes,\" Sovryn said in a press release. STAKERS NOW RESTAKERS? Our Sam Kessler has the scoop: \"The co-founders of Lido, the biggest liquid staking protocol on Ethereum, are secretly funding a competitor to EigenLayer, the buzzy \"restaking\" service that has emerged rapidly this year to become a powerful force in decentralized finance. According to several people with knowledge of the matter, the project is called Symbiotic and has drawn backing from not only the Lido co-founders, Konstantin Lomashuk and Vasiliy Shapovalov, through their venture firm Cyber Fund, but also Paradigm, the crypto venture capital firm that is one of Lido\u0027s lead investors. CoinDesk also obtained internal Symbiotic documents that describe the project, which allows users to \"restake\" using Lido\u0027s staked ether (stETH) token and other popular assets that are not natively compatible with EigenLayer.\" JUST IN: Two brothers have been arrested by the U.S. Department of Justice for attacking the Ethereum blockchain and stealing $25 million of cryptocurrency during a 12-second exploit, according to an indictment unsealed on Wednesday. THE WORDS OF VITALIK. We\u0027ve written quite a bit in The Protocol newsletter about just how prolific (and prolix) the Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin can be as a writer. It\u0027s also true that when he writes, people tend to write a lot about whatever he writes – such as this opus on \"multidimensional gas pricing,\" which Decrypt covered. But apparently Buterin is also crazy fast as a scribbler, especially when it comes to banging out Ethereum improvement proposals on deadline, as chronicled on Tuesday by our Margaux Nijkerk. With time ticking down toward an important meeting to discuss new Ethereum wallet standards, it took Buterin just 22 minutes to draft EIP-7702, offered as a substitute for an earlier proposal, EIP-3074, that had drawn complaints from some developers. The hot-off-the-press publication drew plaudits from critics, with much of the Ethereum community quickly coming around in support of replacing the earlier effort with Buterin\u0027s proposed solution. The courtroom where Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev was sentenced. (Camomile Shumba/CoinDesk) Alexey Pertsev, 31, a developer of the coin mixer Tornado Cash, has been found guilty of money laundering by a Dutch judge, and was given 64 months of prison time. The case, along with other recent actions brought by prosecutors around the world, has raised questions about the extent of responsibility that developers might bear for any code they write. As reported by our Camomile Shumba, prosecutors in the Dutch case made the argument that Pertsev \"should have at least suspected the criminal origins of illicit transactions on the Tornado Cash platform.\" Solana-based crypto trading protocol Cypher has endured its share of hacks and heists. But its latest loss was an inside job. On Tuesday, a pseudonymous developer known as Hoak admitted to stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of cryptocurrencies from Cypher\u0027s hack reimbursement fund. \"I took the funds and gambled them away,\" Hoak said in a statement, blaming his activity on a \"crippling gambling addiction.\" El Salvador set up a new website to track its $350 million bitcoin stockpile, Bitcoin Magazine reported. Degen Chain, an Ethereum layer-3 blockchain dedicated to meme coins, came back online after a two-day outage. (Launched in March, Degen Chain is an \"an ultra-low-cost L3 for the Degen community built with Arbitrum Orbit, Base for settlement, and AnyTrust for data availability,\" according to a blog post at the time by Syndicate, the blockchain\u0027s infrastructure partner.) ICYMI: CoinDesk\u0027s Danny Nelson takes a look inside the shadowy world of crypto influencers known as \"key opinion leaders,\" or KOLs, who invest in the projects they promote on social media – in return for the privilege of selling out before other investors. Top picks of the past week from our Protocol Village column, highlighting key blockchain tech upgrades and news. Hyperbolic\u0027s Proof of Sampling architecture (Zhang et al) 1. Hyperbolic, the two-year-old startup that math olympian Jasper Zhang leads focused on decentralized AI computing, said Thursday that it is introducing a protocol called “Proof of Sampling (PoSP),” aimed at addressing challenges with trust in decentralized AI networks. Hyperbolic was co-founded in 2022 by Zhang and Yuchen Jin, who holds a Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Washington. 2. Lens Lab, a part of the Stani Kulechov-led Avara and the team behind Lens Protocol, a Web3 social platform built on Polygon PoS, announced that it is now developing its own blockchain network, Lens Network. The new network will be built on Matter Labs\u0027 ZK Stack, powered by zkSync on Ethereum. \"The Lens Network will set a new baseline/precedent for how social networks should be built,\" Alex Gluchowski, co-founder and CEO of Matter Labs, said in a press release. 3. Polkadot, the layer-1 chain ecosystem co-founded by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, has debuted Asynchronous Backing, according to the team: It sets the stage for Polkadot 2.0, \"a wave of enhancements expected to significantly improve the scalability, cost, speed and flexibility of the network, and accelerate growth of decentralized applications,\" according to the team. \"Asynchronous Backing cuts block time in half (from 12 to 6 seconds) enables parallel transaction validation block production, and delivers up to 10x higher throughput for Polkadot\u0027s parachain consensus protocol.\" 4. Indian crypto exchange CoinDCX has expanded what started as the Okto wallet into an Okto ecosystem, which will include launching a blockchain, a token, and a points program starting Tuesday. The aim is to give global users a single-click mobile experience while traversing the Web3 space, its co-founders Neeraj Khandelwal and Sumit Gupta told CoinDesk in an interview. 5. Cyber, the just-unveiled rebranding for the developer formerly known as CyberConnect, has launched its own layer-2 network in the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem, describing it as the \"first L2 for social.\" According to the team, the new chain relies on \"top modular solutions. Cyber integrates Optimism’s OP Stack, EigenDA and custom features to provide low fees, high TPS and a user-friendly experience.\" According to a blog post: \"AltLayer will manage the rollup’s technical launch, ongoing management, operations and future upgrades.\" EasyA Consensus Hackathon - Call for Participants This year, Consensus is hosting its first ever in-person hackathon together with the world\u0027s number 1 Web3 learning app, EasyA. This will be a three-day, multi-chain IRL hackathon with world-class sponsors from Sui to Stellar to Polkadot and beyond, and will attract the world’s best developers to build the future of Web3 and raise funding for their projects. Projects launched by EasyA alumni are valued at over $2.5 billion. The EasyA Consensus hackathon is going to be 2024\u0027s most important hackathon yet. We have a few remaining spots left for hackers, so if you\u0027re excited about participating, make sure you sign up here! Avalanche Incubator Colony Lab Co-founders Wessal Erradi and Elie Le Rest (Colony Lab) Even in anything-goes crypto trading, there are conventions designed to protect the little guy. One of those is the vesting period – a window of time following a digital-token sale or airdrop where early investors, such as founders, project contributors and venture-capital backers, are locked up from dumping their allocations. Projects typically do this so that the price of that token doesn’t crash immediately after a listing, say if big stakeholders were to sell right away. Another goal is to make sure insiders and early backers keep skin in the game, an assurance of good faith, as it were. Now comes a new feature from Colony Lab, a developer and project incubator in the Avalanche blockchain ecosystem, called \"liquid vesting.\" If it sounds like a workaround, that\u0027s because it basically is. Have your bags and keep them too. Take liquidity now, without having to wait for the end of the vesting period. Click here for the full article by CoinDesk\u0027s Margaux Nijkerk Fundraisings Data and Tokens We covered last month\u0027s launch of the Runes protocol atop Bitcoin, observing in real time as its instant popularity and uptake right after the bitcoin halving sent transaction fees to record levels, as users scrambled to mint new meme coins, competing to get transactions included in the suddenly-congested blockchain. (As a plug: I\u0027m scheduled to interview Rodarmor onstage on May 31 at CoinDesk\u0027s Consensus conference in Austin.) Even as recently as last week, Runes accounted for a majority of all transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain, outpacing the original bitcoin as well as Ordinals inscriptions and the rival fungible-token standard BRC-20. But the Runes frenzy has now faded somewhat. Runes has been \"written off as a flop, with waning interest failing to match the hype,\" according to a report by the blockchain analysis firm Coin Metrics. The analysts noted, however, that there may still be hope for a resurgence: \"Runes are yet to be validated in the form of listings on major exchanges, trading largely on niche collectibles platforms.\" Transactions related to the new protocol appear to be ticking down: Runes transactions of all types have shrunk since the launch around April 20.

    "title": "Alleged Owner of Darknet Narcotics Bazaar ‘Incognito Market’ Arrested in New York",
    "detailedContent": "U.S. authorities have arrested and charged a Taiwanese national with operating darknet drug bazaar Incognito Market, which he allegedly used to facilitate over $100 million in crypto-denominated sales of illegal narcotics including fentanyl. Prosecutors say Rui-Siang Lin, 23, operated Incognito Market under the pseudonym “Pharoah” and oversaw all of its operations, including employees, vendors and customers, and had “ultimate decision-making authority over every aspect of the multimillion-dollar operation” from its formation in October 2020 to its shutdown in March this year. “The dedicated prosecutors from the Southern District of New York and our law enforcement partners will pursue criminal actors regardless of whether they operate on street corners or in the dark corners of the internet,” said U.S. Attorney Damian Williams in a Monday statement. “The so-called ‘dark web’ is not a safe haven for those who seek to break the law.” Lin was arrested at New York’s John F. Kennedy Airport on Saturday and will be presented in front of a Southern District of New York (SDNY) magistrate judge today. He faces one count of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, one count of narcotics conspiracy, one count of money laundering, and one count of conspiracy to sell adulterated and misbranded medication. The first charge – sometimes called the “kingpin statute” – carries a mandatory minimum sentence of life in prison. Ross Ulbricht, the creator and operator of the now-shuttered Silk Road darknet drug marketplace, was found guilty of the same crime and sentenced to life in prison. The narcotics conspiracy charge carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years and a maximum potential sentence of life in prison. The other two charges carry a combined maximum of 25 years in prison. Lin allegedly made millions from operating Incognito Market, which took a 5% cut of every sale. The darknet market had its own “bank,” prosecutors said, which gave users an additional layer of anonymity by allowing them to deposit cryptocurrency into their own accounts, which the site then automatically transferred from buyers to sellers, minus the fee. According to the complaint, Lin created and operated Incognito Market while an undergraduate student at the prestigious National Taiwan University. In March, Incognito Market shut down after reportedly pulling an exit scam that left users unable to withdraw their funds. Administrators of the site then reportedly began extorting vendors, ordering them to pay a fee ranging from $100 to $20,000, depending on their size, or else risk having their customers’ data leaked. Lin, a self-described crypto developer and fan of privacy coin Monero, said on X that he facilitated a four-day workshop on cyber crime and cryptocurrency for 30 police officers at the Saint Lucia Police Academy in early April.",

    "title": "Ether ETFs Filing Process Sees Abrupt Progress, Though Approval Not Guaranteed: Sources",
    "detailedContent": "The exchanges that want to list and trade shares of spot ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds are abruptly being asked by regulators to update key filings related to these products. Exchanges are being asked to update 19b-4 filings on an accelerated basis by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, three people familiar with the situation told CoinDesk, suggesting they may be moving to approve these applications ahead of a key deadline this Thursday. That doesn\u0027t mean the ETFs will be authorized, though. Would-be issuers also need their S-1 applications approved before the products could begin trading. SEC could take an indefinite amount of time to approve the S-1 documents, one person familiar with the matter said, as it isn\u0027t tied to a deadline. One company in talks with the SEC said it feels like it might be on the right track for approval, in a turnaround from feeling some weeks ago that the SEC was dragging its feet, according to a person familiar with the matter. Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart raised their odds for the approval of a spot ether ETF to 75% from 25% on Monday after hearing chatter that the SEC could be taking a more favorable stance towards the applications. They later corrected their statement, saying that the odds were related to the 19b-4 approvals. The SEC is expected to make a decision on VanEck spot ether ETF on May 23rd. The SEC has been investigating whether ether, the chief native asset to the Ethereum blockchain, is a security, launching a formal inquiry after the network moved from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake mechanism. If ether is deemed to be a security by the SEC, that may be one reason for the regulator to reject the spot ether ETF applications. One test of the agency\u0027s view on whether ETH is a security has newly emerged at Prometheum. The special purpose broker announced Monday it had soft-launched its ether custody service. The company eventually intends to launch custody and trading services for other digital assets – importantly, assets that are treated as securities in the U.S., not commodities.

    "title": "Craig Wright Lied to UK Court \u0027Extensively and Repeatedly,\u0027 Judge Writes",
    "detailedContent": "Craig Wright lied \"extensively and repeatedly\" in both his written and oral evidence in the Crypto Open Patent Alliance case regarding his claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto, Judge James Mellor said in his written judgement on Monday. Mellor also concluded that the issue of injunctive relief - a legal remedy to stop a defendant from doing something - will be argued at a Form of Order hearing that will be appointed after the judgment has been handed down. Mellor in March concluded Wright was not Nakamoto, the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, and that he had not authored the cryptocurrency\u0027s foundational document known as the white paper. \"I want to thank those of you who sent me messages of support yesterday. I await the written judgment at which point I will consider my options for appeal,” Wright said on X (formally known as Twitter) in March. Although the ruling can be appealed, Mellor’s definitive statement following the month-long trial was cause for celebration for the broader crypto industry, which has long criticized and been victim to Wright’s legal battles against members of the community. “Dr. Wright is not the person who adopted or operated under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto in the period 2008 to 2011. Third, Dr. Wright is not the person who created the Bitcoin System. And, fourth, he is not the author of the initial versions of the Bitcoin software,” Mellor said after both parties to the trial had presented their evidence. The Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA), whose stated mission is to protect the adoption of crypto and fight threats against the new technology, filed to take Wright to court in 2021. The trial commenced on Feb. 5, with COPA accusing Wright of forgery and, later, perjury. \"I am entirely satisfied that Dr Wright lied to the Court extensively and repeatedly,\" Mellor said. \"Most of his lies related to the documents he had forged which purported to support his claim.\" COPA, whose backers include Twitter founder Jack Dorsey and crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN), said it will seek several injunctions to prevent Wright from claiming to be Nakamoto and taking Bitcoin developers to court again. It has also said it may ask U.K. prosecutors to consider perjury charges against Wright for statements made during the trial. \"Dr Wright’s attempts to prove he was/is Satoshi Nakamoto represent a most serious abuse of this Court’s process,\" Mellor said in his judgment. \"The same point applies to other jurisdictions as well: Norway in particular.\" Wright also had a nearly five year long legal battle against Norwegian bitcoiner Hodlonaut. In March, Mellor imposed a worldwide freezing order on 6 million British pounds ($7.6 million) worth of Wright assets to ensure he couldn\u0027t move them offshore or evade costs from the COPA trial. According to the order, COPA\u0027s costs for the case amounted to 6.7 million pounds at the time.

    "title": "Crypto Industry Rallies Behind House Bill as It Heads Toward Final Vote",
    "detailedContent": "The U.S. House of Representatives is on the verge of a vote that will represent the closest the cryptocurrency industry has ever been toward finally winning regulation in the U.S., and the sector\u0027s associations and top businesses are encouraging House leaders to support the effort. Through the Crypto Council for Innovation, a coalition of digital assets organizations and companies, including Coinbase, Kraken, Andreessen Horowitz, the Digital Currency Group and about 50 others, wrote a letter to Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-La.) and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), advocating for passage of the bill. The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) has been authorized for floor time next week, where observers are hoping to see a mid-week vote. The bill would set the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as a leading regulator of digital assets, and it sets out clear divisions for what the CFTC will handle and what would fall under the reach of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It would establish consumer protections – including rules around custody of customers\u0027 assets and their treatment in bankruptcy – and set up further guardrails against risky behavior. \"By passing this legislation, we can accelerate the growth of blockchain technology and digital assets, fostering financial inclusion and protecting national security,\" according to the letter. \"It is crucial for the U.S. to maintain its leadership in financial innovation.\" The crypto industry is on a high in Washington at the moment, having watched both the House and Senate easily pass a resolution overturning a crypto accounting policy from the SEC, though President Joe Biden vowed to veto the effort. That move to erase the SEC\u0027s Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121) represented a fight that went decidedly in the industry\u0027s favor, drawing many supporters from the Democratic Party that\u0027s been more reticent than Republicans in backing crypto. For that accounting tussle, more than one in five Senate Democrats voted on the industry\u0027s side, including Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), and it was about one in 10 Democrats in the House. But the comprehensive legislation now approaching a House vote is of a much higher magnitude, and key Senate Democrats have so far seemed unprepared to match the House\u0027s effort. To date, the Senate has only shown a potential willingness to fit a different crypto bill – one regulating stablecoin issuers – into a package deal with other financial legislation. Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee where the bill was launched, said the level of Democratic support for FIT21 in the House could be a major factor in whether the Senate is moved to action. When the measure cleared his committee, it did so with a handful of Democrats on board, despite opposition from their senior member, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) On its way toward the floor, the FIT21 effort drew a range of amendments called for by the House Rules Committee to meet a May 16 deadline.",

    "detailedContent": "Detained Binance executive Tigran Gambaryan’s bail application was denied by a Nigerian court on the grounds that there is a likelihood that he will manage to jump bail, the spokesperson for the executive’s family said on Friday. Binance and the executives’ money laundering, tax evasion and the exchanges detained Head of Compliance Tigran Gambaryans bail hearings all occurred on Friday in Nigeria. The court ruled that Binance can be served with the Federal Inland Revenue Service tax evasion charge through Gambaryan. Tigran’s lawyers objected to the application on the grounds that they needed to review the amended charge to advise Gambaryan on taking his plea. The court agreed to adjourn the matter to May 22 for arraignment, where charges are formally laid against the defendant. Gambaryan, who turned 40 on Friday, has been detained in Nigeria since February when he arrived with the British-Kenyan regional manager for Africa, Nadeem Anjarwalla. Anjarwalla has since escaped. “I truly cannot believe that my innocent husband is now - on his 40th birthday - having to face a trial for charges that he has nothing to do with,” said Yuki Gambaryan, the wife of Tigran Gambaryan. “The whole world is watching what he is being put through, and I just pray that common sense and justice will prevail and that Tigran will be allowed to come home to us.” A month after the exchange’s executives were detained in the country, they, along with the exchange, were charged with money laundering and tax evasion. Gambaryan was later moved to Kuje prison, which also houses the likes of members of the Boko Haram terrorist group. Nigeria’s Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) money laundering trial commenced on Friday with a Nigerian prosecutor who called on Abdulkadir Abbas from the Nigerian SEC as the first prosecution witness. After the prosecution finished examining their first witness, Tigran’s lawyers asked for a stand down—which means to put a matter on hold for a short while—to obtain certified records of certain documents in the proof of evidence to be used in their cross-examination of the witness. The court adjourned the trial until May 23 at noon. “We are deeply disappointed that Tigran Gambaryan, who has no decision-making power in the company, continues to be detained. Tigran has been dedicated to public service and fighting crime for most of his life. These charges against him are completely meritless. He should be freed while discussions continue between Binance and Nigerian government officials,\" a Binance Spokesperson said. Binance’s CEO Richard Teng recently released a blog post calling on the Nigerian government to release Gambaryan.

    "detailedContent": "Türkiye has introduced a legislative proposal aimed at reducing the risks of parties transacting with crypto assets in the country. The proposal has been presented to the parliament. The bill, introduced by ruling party chairman Abdullah Güler, includes various regulations regarding crypto assets and will be implemented by the Capital Markets Board (CMB). This proposal establishes important rules regarding crypto service providers and increases the CMB’s supervision over them. The bill aims to introduce a licensing scheme for crypto firms, which will be handled by the CMB and bring the firms under the regulator\u0027s scope. To protect customers, the scope of inspections for crypto providers will also be expanded. Although there is no provision regarding taxation in the bill, CMB and TÜBİTAK will obtain certain rates of income from crypto service providers. CMB and TÜBİTAK will receive 1% of these revenues from crypto service providers. The Scientific and Technological Research Institution of Türkiye (TÜBİTAK) is a national agency of the country whose stated goal is to develop “science, technology and innovation” policies, support and conduct research and development. This bill is expected to increase Türkiye’s compliance with international standards regarding crypto assets, eliminate criticism from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and make the country’s crypto ecosystem safer. In March, the country’s economy minister, Mehmet Şimşek, shared the government’s efforts to get out of the FATF gray list with the public and stated that a delegation will come to Türkiye for inspection in April-May and emphasized that the gray list will be removed. Also in March, the ruling AK Party Deputy Chairman of Information and Communication Technologies Ömer İleri said, \"We find it very important to carry out a legal study in the field of crypto assets. This legal regulation is primarily a study that will regulate the platforms, but beyond that, it will be a regulation that will protect our citizens and investors.\" CORRECTION (May 17, 13:00 UTC): Removes reference to the bill prohibiting firms without local origin.

    "summary": "Op-Ed: DYOR is your call to action, not a disclaimer.",
    "title": "Bull Market Mastery: 4 Crucial Ways To Do Your Own Research (DYOR)",
    "detailedContent": "Over the years, the phrase \"do your own research\" (DYOR) has become ubiquitous within the crypto community. While it is sound advice, the term has been largely reduced to a mere disclaimer that people use to sidestep responsibility when promoting their projects. This is not how it should be. As we enter the bull market, keep in mind that “DYOR” isn’t just some disclaimer-like catchphrase – it\u0027s an essential practice that separates savvy crypto users from gamblers. Done correctly, DYOR should help inform crucial crypto decisions, mitigate risks, and maximize opportunities. So, with markets heating up, here are the 4 most important things to zoom in on. 1. Onchain Data When figuring out your next big move, it’s essential to make informed decisions based on transparent data rather than relying solely on third-party opinions. This direct access ensures authenticity and transparency, enabling you to uncover insights that may otherwise be obscured. And while data analysis may seem relatively technical at a glance, a new generation of onchain data analytics tools make it easier than ever to dive into the data yourself, regardless of whether you’re a crypto veteran or new user. Onchain analytics tools like Flipside, Nansen, and Messari simplify access to important metrics such as active user count, token distribution, and protocol interactions across the web3 space. For DeFi projects, relevant data points to assess include TVL, trading volume, and liquidity pool dynamics. Note that most onchain data analytics tools require paid subscriptions, but there are free resources out there that let you dig through the data without ever spending a cent. For instance, Flipside lets you create your own custom queries using data from 25+ different blockchains and protocols and browse thousands of existing community-made dashboards for free. No single metric paints a complete picture of a project’s traction and potential, but being open to looking at the data yourself will go a long way toward helping you decipher what is actually taking place onchain. And while it’s often helpful to reference pre-configured and community-contributed dashboards, it’s ideal to dive deeper into the data with your own custom queries. 2. Developer Activity Developer activity provides insights into a project’s technical progress and long-term viability. Industry reports like Electric Capital’s Developer Report provide an interesting macro view of the web3 development landscape, but you’ll need to zoom into specific projects for more actionable insights. It’s often helpful to start with the public documentation listed on a project’s GitHub or GitLab. While these platforms may feel overwhelming at a glance if you’re not a developer, you can still gauge how active these projects are and gain additional context. Note that large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are increasingly capable of synthesizing code repositories and explaining what they do, which can help you to determine what a project is prioritizing and building. Additionally, many projects make a clear effort to attract and support developers to build with them on their network. As a result, it can be helpful to look through a project’s developer resources, including their Gitbook or documentation pages, and see whether they have any ecosystem grants or other builder incentive systems. 3. Community Activity Community is the lifeblood of any web3 project, but this is where most of the red herrings appear. At the end of the day, crypto influencers, analysts, and even regular community members or token holders have their own motivations. If someone finds a compelling market signal, it’s in their best interest to act on it early instead of broadcasting it to the world – so all advice or hopium you come across should be taken with a grain of salt, even if it seems well-intentioned. This doesn’t mean you should ignore all the signals scattered across the crypto social scene; you just need to do your best to filter out the noise, whether you are looking at X (formerly Twitter), Discord, Reddit or any other popular platforms. When assessing a project\u0027s community activity, consider engagement metrics such as the ratio of likes and comments to the project’s total follower count and the quality of third-party mentions. Watch out for red flags like high follower count accounts with low engagement, sudden spikes in followers not accompanied by similar increases in engagement, and generic, repetitive social posts. These patterns may indicate a project’s reliance on bots or other manipulative tactics to fluff its community growth figures. 4. Investors and Project Teams The composition of a project\u0027s key team members and investors can affect its credibility and likelihood of succeeding. Projects with a deep bench of credentialed founders and investors with successful, verifiable track records bring a lot of validation to their brand, and most projects mention key team members and investors on their website. From there, you can look into their respective Linkedin pages, social accounts, and other personal channels. It’s important to note that lesser-known or even anonymous project teams are not necessarily a negative indicator. But very few low-quality web3 projects manage to attract prominent team members with extensive experience in their respective fields. When researching these key players, be sure to take note of whether they publicly advocate for the project on their own social channels. The way these individuals communicate about the project in public can reflect their actual level of involvement and enthusiasm (or lack thereof), and highly engaged team members and investors can signal a project\u0027s strength. DYOR Is Your Call to Action, Not a Disclaimer The crypto community has been increasingly optimistic in recent months, following positive price trends and rumors about potential SEC-approved crypto funds around the corner. But money attracts attention, which is why every bull market is accompanied by a deluge of misinformation, scammers, and hackers. These conditions make it more difficult to discern which projects are high quality and worthy of your time and resources, and which are effectively well-marketed vaporware. But this is exactly why it’s so crucial to actually DYOR. As we enter the next bull market, let\u0027s embrace DYOR – not as a catchphrase to sidestep personal responsibility, but as a practical process that guides our interactions in the exciting and ever-evolving world of web3. - Jim Myers is an engineer, early-stage investor, and the CTO \u0026 Co-Founder of Flipside Crypto, a leading blockchain data analytics and business intelligence platform.

    "detailedContent": "There are many narratives around scalability in web3 and we should remember that they are just that: narratives. Their power lies in the way they frame problems, and, consequently, the way we solve them. In this sense, they are more like tools than final answers. Narratives around the problem of scalability are no different in that they can be useful when applied correctly. Perhaps we can ask ourselves what narratives around infrastructure are better for which kind of use cases. If we step outside of the dominant narratives around “layer n” solutions and the debate among monolithic versus modular blockchains, we find more elegant alternatives that can be better suited to end-user applications. The concept of microchains looks at scalability from a new perspective: that of scaling at the validator level instead of at the blockchain level. The result is an approach that prioritizes web3 applications that need to support an unlimited number of active users. The monolithic chain is dead; long live the monolithic chain Right now, if you ask a development team how they are building a web3 application, they will probably mention including a rollup solution or app-chain. This is because all the web3 applications that are built strictly on a layer-1 are in a constant tug-of-war for blockspace in the network. This is a historical problem. Since the early days of web3 development, we have expected to have “One Network to Rule them All,” or a singular chain that solves all problems. This monolithic view of scalability is unnecessary and has only made it harder for builders to offer users basic things like tolerable transaction speeds or efficient gas costs. As a result, both infrastructure projects and web3 application development teams have rightfully started to look for alternatives. Going layered? Going modular? As the web3 space has evolved, new projects use solutions like L2s and modular chains that help them offer more consistent and reliable user experiences. In recent years, we have seen a lot of development (and investment) focused on technologies like optimistic rollups, app-specific chains, and other layered or modular solutions. It’s easy to understand why modular scalability has been all the rage as of late. By taking a modular approach, L1 chains like Ethereum can focus on scaling only the essential properties of their networks. In turn, they delegate other non-essential scalability problems to third parties and leave room for a whole ecosystem of L2 solutions. In other words, by going for a modular approach to address scalability, they are leaving behind the idea of a monolithic chain and seeing scalability as an add-on. But are modular chains really the ideal, or end state, for blockchain scalability? As useful as they can be, they also introduce new problems, ranging from extra steps in the user journey to some security concerns (including incomplete fraud proof implementations, software bugs in ZK proofs, and front running by centralized entities.) Yet, for the past few years, the industry has been limited in thinking about the problem under these terms. This is because of a certain kind of path dependency: we\u0027re used to thinking about blockchain scalability in one way just because we’ve mimetically taken that as the starting point. These are historical reasons, not practical or technical reasons — and it does not have to be the case. Microchains: beyond the modular approach Let’s take a step back, reframe the problem. What if we could take a step back and design an L1 that scales from the start? We could even revisit the concept of the monolithic chain under a new light — not to go back to it, but to reimagine the main blockchain infrastructure from a more efficient perspective. We have the opportunity to scale a main blockchain infrastructure at the validator level, for web3 applications that can horizontally scale (in the first place). The key element to unlock these capabilities is a system where a set of honest and well-incentivized validators can run multiple — even infinite — lightweight chains in parallel. A similar situation already happens with validators who use their data centers to run on different L1s. Each of these chains — we call them microchains — can be much smaller in size than a typical L1 chain but still share in the same security guarantees of any large-scale delegated proof-of-stake blockchain network. Because they share the same validator set, they can easily share messages and operations between each other, reducing latency. Making room for the Personal Blockchain Beyond scalability, the real advantages of the microchain approach are seen in an improved user experience. Running an unlimited set of parallel chains means that every user could become a partial node for their own chain, with the ability to create their own blockspace as necessary. In this system, individual wallets are at the center, proposing their own blocks, and don’t compete for blockchain infrastructure resources. One way to look at microchains is to see them as a step away from monolithic blockchains and their layered, modular add-ons, and as a step towards what we could call The Personal Blockchain. Imagine every user having their own chain that interacts with other users’ chains and can create new blocks whenever they want. That’s an alternative that exists when we think outside of flavor-of-the-day narratives of web3 scalability. - Mathieu Baudet is the founder and CEO of Linera, the first low-latency blockchain designed to scale elastically through the introduction of microchains.

    "title": "DeFi Predictions for 2024: Private Credit in the Lower Middle Market",
    "detailedContent": "Is web3 alive and well, or is it fizzling out? That seems to be the question on a lot of people’s minds. It’s been a hard couple of years for the global economy at large. In the US, the Fed has taken extraordinary steps to bring inflation under control. It’s also been an incredibly hard couple of years for the crypto industry, exacerbated by large scale collapses stemming from poor risk management all the way to fraud. We are also in an environment of high regulatory uncertainty in the US. Bleak as it may sound, there is activity in web3 that is showing a lot of promise, particularly in private credit. Let’s do a deep dive. Historically private credit had focused on mezzanine loans or opportunistic debt opportunities. In recent years, banks have been growing their residential and commercial mortgage books while reducing exposure to commercial loans. While large issuers were able to raise money from bond issuances in the public capital markets, the wide gap in the middle market has been primarily filled by the private credit industry – currently at $1T in the US and about $1.7T globally. High yield corporate debt is currently providing around 9% yield (as of October 2023) and private credit commands an illiquidity premium of 150-300 bps for uni-tranche or senior debt, the spread increasing considerably for junior debt. Matching Demand and Supply The existing private credit market mostly caters to the middle market. While demand from the lower middle market has been high, supply of capital has always been constrained. This is because large asset allocators invest capital with managers who are unable to underwrite small-scale deals. Smaller institutional investors like family offices, global alternative investment funds etc., have traditionally faced two challenges: Finding high-quality deals for direct or syndicated investments A preference for some liquidity, though the underlying investments themselves may be fundamentally illiquid. Issuers, on the other hand, have not had platforms to avail private credit, often having to rely on high-cost bespoke deals with high net-worth investors. How Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Is Revolutionizing “Lower Middle Market” Private Credit In the past few years, we have seen DeFi lending evolve from fully decentralized overcollateralized crypto lending protocols like Compound and Aave, to protocols like Centrifuge, Goldfinch, Credix, Maple, Huma and others that are able to finance traditional “real world assets” (RWA) using DeFi rails. The spectrum of RWA financing covers diverse use cases comprising real estate financing, asset-based financing (receivables, inventory, and other assets), voluntary carbon offsets, advances (pay advance and royalties advance), receivables factoring and many others. Protocols focused on these use cases are either specializing in specific niches (e.g., Goldfinch focusing on lending to fintechs that lend to small businesses, or Huma focusing on providing receivables-backed financing to financial institutions), or geography-focused (e.g., Credix offering loans to fintechs or funding receivables factoring in Latin America). According to RWA.xyz, an on-chain analytics platform for RWA, the private credit market on DeFi rails is currently at about $550M of active loans. While still in nascence, given the size of the global lower middle market, this sector has huge potential for future growth. What Pain Points Are Being Solved by DeFi In addition to enabling new capital formation for global trade and commerce, there are specific advantages that are natively possible only on the Blockchain. Let us look at the example of Huma and its client Arf. Arf is radically transforming the status quo in the global remittance industry which has traditionally relied on pre-funded accounts (estimated at over $4T) across counterparties to enable fast settlements. Using the Huma platform, Arf can provide just in time credit to its Financial Institution (FI) clients and instantaneously settle with counterparties using USDC (fiat pegged stablecoin issued by Circle). Within 10 months, Arf has done over $400M of settlements on USDC and expects to get to $2B+ in annualized transaction volume in the near term. By freeing up capital locked in pre-funded accounts Arf can remove substantial capital and operational overhead for its clients. Erbil Karaman, co-founder, and CEO of Huma says: “According to the UN, about one in nine people globally rely on funds sent home by migrant workers. What Huma and Arf have achieved shows that remittance companies around the world can now operate with much greater efficiency and instantaneous settlement 24/7 anywhere in the world.” Also, given the short-term nature of these types of receivables, lenders and liquidity providers might have access to higher liquidity (e.g., 30-60 days redemption requests), rather than being locked into illiquid investments for years. What’s Next Stablecoins have achieved about $125B in market capitalization. As programmable money, they are poised to become the payment and settlement rails for web3, the value internet. However, until US regulations on stablecoins are clear, and a bill like H.R. 4766 comes to pass, there will continue to be uncertainty in the broader industry. But we are certainly starting to see major companies like Visa and Paypal getting actively involved in the space. Visa recently expanded stablecoin settlement capabilities with Circle’s USDC on the Solana blockchain, while Paypal, in partnership with Paxos announced the launch of its stablecoin PYUSD, on the Ethereum blockchain. There are still several issues pertaining to risk management that the DeFi private credit industry needs to solve, especially in a global context. In recent months we have seen private credit deals default on well-known platforms, demonstrating the need for good credit underwriting and ongoing performance monitoring. In time, these issues can either be addressed or somewhat mitigated. Various forms of credit enhancements (e.g., tranching, adding pool covers or cash collateralization) can also create layers of principal protection. I expect this industry to continue growing rapidly in 2024 and beyond. - Sanjay is the VP of web3 Initiatives of Roofstock onChain, the web3 subsidiary of Roofstock, where he leads the real estate investing platform’s blockchain initiative.

    "title": "DeFi\u0027s Trust Puzzle: What Institutions Need to Jump In",
    "detailedContent": "Decentralized finance (DeFi) is not just a fleeting trend. Anchored in its promise are financial inclusivity, democratization, and attractive yields. From delivering diverse investment avenues to spearheading technical innovations, to obliterating geographical barriers, DeFi is redefining the boundaries of financial engagement. For all of DeFi\u0027s seismic opportunities, traditional financial institutions remain conspicuously restrained. Their reservations are multifaceted. The concerns surrounding AML/KYC, data privacy, cybersecurity, gaps in governance models, the lack of recourse mechanisms, and the unclear legal terrain are all contributing factors. The palpable tension between the transformative promise of DeFi and the cautious reserve of institutional players underscores a defining moment for global finance. How these two financial domains converge, or diverge, will chart the path for the next era of finance. Navigating the DeFi Minefield: Risks and Roadblocks for Institutions At the heart of institutional reticence towards DeFi lies a complex web of challenges, each posing significant questions about the viability and long-term potential of these decentralized solutions. Security Concerns: The blockchain space is rife with tales of smart contract flaws leading to multi-million dollar losses. 2022 was the biggest year for lost funds yet, with over $3.8b lost. Notable hacks such as Ronin Bridge and Poly Network (over $600m each) have underscored that while blockchain transactions are immutable, they are not impervious. Data Privacy: Institutions catering to high-net-worth clients or specialized markets cannot afford the exposure of trading histories or positions, as it could tip off competitors or undermine strategic market moves. Over time, as data accrues, this openness can inadvertently reveal patterns or investor behaviors. Consider the phenomenon of \"whale tracking\" on platforms like Twitter and Telegram. These tools, utilized by a growing public, monitor substantial crypto-asset movements on decentralized exchanges and various DeFi platforms. This leads to widespread speculations about the identities of these \"whales\" – investors with significant crypto holdings. This level of visibility and the ensuing conjectures can sometimes be unsettling for participants who value discretion in their financial endeavors. Regulatory Uncertainties: The regulatory climate for DeFi remains in flux. Institutions, often under the microscope of regulators, must navigate this uncertain terrain with caution. The fear of future compliance pitfalls or regulatory backlash can be a significant deterrent. This year alone, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued both Coinbase and Binance for either trading or offering unregistered securities. The agency also issued a number of warnings and took steps to increase its scrutiny of the crypto industry by creating a dedicated Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit. AML/KYC Risk Controls: For many institutions, the permissionless nature of DeFi is both a boon and a bane. Ensuring AML/KYC compliance is pivotal, not only to mitigate legal risks but also to uphold institutional reputation by preventing inadvertent association with illicit activities or unsanctioned entities. The EU’s inaugural regulatory framework for crypto assets, Markets in Crypto-assets (MiCA), imposes a number of new requirements on providers of crypto asset services. Under MiCA, they must be authorized by a national competent authority, carry out AML/KYC checks, put limits on leverage, and disclose info about their products and services to consumers. Back in August of 2022, the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Tornado Cash, a cryptocurrency mixer that allows users to obscure the source and destination of their transactions. After alleging that Tornado Cash has been used to launder money for North Korean hackers, a number of exchanges and other crypto businesses delisted Tornado Cash which led to a decline in the price of its native token. Lack of Standardization: The DeFi landscape is diverse and evolving, with each platform often having its own set of rules and mechanisms. The absence of a universal standard or benchmark makes due diligence cumbersome and increases the risk of missteps. Mature Governance and Conduct Models: Institutions are accustomed to stringent governance and conduct models, ensuring transparency and accountability. The decentralized and sometimes opaque governance of DeFi protocols can be disconcerting. For DeFi to genuinely appeal to institutions, it must align with the professional standards expected in traditional finance. The Building Blocks for Institutional Trust The institutional hesitancy around DeFi, while warranted, can be addressed with targeted strategies that rebuild trust and reinforce the stability and security of the sector. Robust Security Measures: The DeFi world has to prioritize paramount security measures. This means regularly conducting in-depth smart contract audits, offering meaningful bug bounties to identify vulnerabilities, and promoting the use of multi-signature wallets to diversify security dependencies. Clear Regulatory Pathways: For institutional trust, ambiguity is the enemy. Collaborative dialogues between DeFi pioneers and regulators can pave a clear, compliant pathway, assuring institutions of the legitimacy of their decentralized endeavors. KYC/AML Initiatives: By integrating rigorous KYC and AML procedures, DeFi can strike the right balance between upholding user privacy and meeting stringent regulatory standards, thereby ensuring a more secure and accountable ecosystem. Awareness \u0026 Educational Initiatives: Misunderstanding breeds mistrust. By rolling out extensive training programs and resourceful guides, institutions can navigate DeFi with newfound confidence, dispelling myths and reinforcing knowledge. Interoperability and Standardization: DeFi stands to gain immensely from cross-chain solutions and standardized practices, fostering smoother, more predictable interactions across platforms. Transparent Governance: An open, decentralized governance model empowers community members, ensuring everyone has a voice. This collective oversight instills trust, as decisions are made transparently, reflecting the broader interests of the community. Conclusion By laying down these foundational blocks, the chasm between institutional reservations and the expansive potential of DeFi can be bridged, ushering in an era of harmonized financial innovation. - Akash Mahendra is Director of the Haven1 Foundation where he leads strategy, operations, and risk management efforts in support of Haven1 — an EVM-compatible L1 blockchain purpose-built to provide a secure environment for on-chain finance.

    "title": "Design Flexibility: The New Pinnacle of Web3 Development",
    "detailedContent": "Decentralized applications (dApps) are at the forefront of the web3 movement, offering a more open and user-centric internet. The development of these applications, however, is not without its challenges. In the long list of web3 hurdles that have been placed in front of web3 developers (security, scalability, UX, incentives), there’s another challenge that remains elusive and less discussed: design flexibility. The Current State of DApp Development In today’s world of traditional software, developers have a wealth of tools and libraries they use to build user-friendly applications. The options for today’s web2 developers are abundant — in short, their design options are flexible. In web3, by contrast, the constraints of the technology often limits developers. This is most obvious for applications built on Ethereum and executed in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Every smart contract interaction (i.e. every transaction) runs through the EVM, updating the network’s state in the process. Every transaction on the EVM incurs a gas cost; the more complex the transaction, the higher the cost. Blockspace is finite on Ethereum, so when rising gas costs and finite blockspace collide, a competitive environment arises. During times of high network demand, competition intensifies. Web3 users and dApps find themselves in bidding wars, vying for their transactions to be processed in earlier blocks and being forced to pay high fees to make it happen. This dynamic, however, doesn’t just translate to high costs. It fundamentally influences how dApps are designed in the first place. Developers are often forced to prioritize gas optimization over software functionality. The result is a development landscape where innovation is stifled and design choices are made not for user experience, but to compensate for the limitations of the underlying infrastructure. Today’s L2 Gas Solutions Gas cost and scalability are critical to the success of web3, and many layer 2 projects today aim to find a solution. By executing transactions off-chain, L2s promise less competition for blockspace. However, while these networks have alleviated some of the acute pressures of gas wars, they don’t fully address the core issue: design flexibility. Even with L2 solutions, dApps remain tethered to the EVM’s constraints. The competitive bidding dynamics between gas and blockspace are inherent to shared EVM spaces, which most of these L2s still are. Even if those pressures are reduced with today’s L2 rollup solutions, developers still find themselves making design compromises. The Search for a Better Development Environment The search for more design freedom has led projects to explore alternatives to the EVM, such as EVM+ and WASM. These alternatives allow developers to write smart contracts in more traditional programming languages like Rust and Python. The real power of traditional programming languages lies in their vast open source libraries. These libraries, built over decades of global developer input, offer pre-written, battle-tested solutions to complex problems. Developers use these libraries to build faster and more efficiently. These web2 libraries rely on an operating system that provides memory management, system hardware, security, and more. However, EVM alternatives cannot support an operating system precisely because of the computational limitations of shared environments in current L2s. This means that even with these “developer friendly” EVM alternatives, dApp developers can’t benefit from most open source libraries. Without those resources, even basic developer tasks remain cumbersome and inefficient. Finding the Right Path to Design Flexibility Reaching the pinnacle of design flexibility thus requires a few different innovations to intersect. First, the competition for blockspace and gas costs needs to be resolved so that developers can focus on the perfect dApp for users rather than the perfect dApp for gas optimizations. Once developers move from a shared environment into an app-specific one, the question becomes: \"what can be done with these massive gains in computing power?\" Now they’ll have the resources to build with full implementations of familiar programming languages rather than limited versions or web3-native languages. These languages need to be available alongside vast open source libraries that benefit from the global “hive mind” of developers. The need for all these intersections requires a fundamentally new approach to achieve design flexibility. Design flexibility is not a “nice to have” feature. It is a necessity for more web3 applications to move beyond intrigue and begin making noticeable, scalable changes to the way we operate online. It is up to the broader community to continue innovating to build the web3 future we all envision. - Felipe Argento is an advisor at the Cartesi Foundation, focusing on Layer 2 research and application.

    "title": "Transforming the Workforce: The Evolving Role of DAOs in Shaping the Future of Work",
    "detailedContent": "There has never been a more opportune moment to establish a DAO. Remote work is still on the ascent, displaying no signs of slowing down, and the gig and creator economies are also scaling up. The future will be defined by on-chain communities, where progress is driven not solely by individuals but by collectives. To get there, DAOs need to level up their approaches to governance, contributor engagement and retention, and improve compensation processes and methods. Here’s how we can move closer to that point. Move away from one token, one vote Judging on a per wallet basis, there are only approximately 2.5 million eligible voters in today’s DAOs. With roughly 676 DAOs in formally recorded existence and 330 of those averaging under 1000 token holders, the DAO space would appear to favor a select few. This is far from the ideal state of shifting the power of the firm and every community in existence back to the people that truly make them run. So what can be done? DAOs need to move away from the pay to play model and onto distributing voting power and ownership more equitably. One example would be a quadratic voting-inspired model where the square root of token weight (tokens owned) is taken to determine voting power, with another being a “DAO-based democracy,” where the whole DAO elects a certain number of officials to vote for it on all issues. Since most DAOs are still one token, one vote, it’s early, but organizations like Gitcoin and the work done by RadicalxChange point the way towards a better future. Truly put crypto on the back-end Still, improving the governance structures behind DAOs is only a fraction of the battle. What about uncovering their greater potential to the world beyond the crypto-sphere? In order for us to even get close to that point, we need, as Jon Hillis from Cabin puts it, for “the infrastructure to be invisible.” Not everyone needs to know how to purchase a token from Uniswap. Tokens aren’t even always needed for DAOs to run. Consider Ukraine DAO. They’ve never had a token and they continue to scale membership, mostly from individuals who have little to no crypto knowledge and do not need to have said knowledge. How do they do it? They make it as easy as possible to both onboard and stay meaningfully involved, pushing the DAO’s mission forward. All DAOs could stand to learn from Ukraine DAO’s example and put crypto on the back-end as much as possible. The easier we make it for anyone to experience the future of coordination and work, the more people will realize that the future can be more distributive than extractive. Introduce credentialing where necessary Decentralized doesn’t always mean fully permissionless in every way. Yes, it could be said to be a hot take. Still, some DAOs need gated workstreams. Consider, for example, a group that wants to decentralize the research and development of medicines and other treatments. VitaDAO does this in the arena of longevity research, splitting interested individuals by their backgrounds, including only letting academics in the field of longevity science be involved in sourcing projects for prospective funding by the DAO. Boys Club requires an invite from an existing member who assures the rest of the community that you are a creative that aligns with the community’s mission. Ukraine DAO ensures that all operational decisions are made by Ukrainians. Bankless DAO relies on guilds, through which existing members vet that prospective members are cut out for the tasks involved, such as legal, writing, or project management, and more. No matter the type of DAO, some degree of credentialing is needed. For some, that means every working group. For others, that means only circles such as legal that require highly specialized skills need to be gated. Judge what to do with your particular DAO based on first, what its mission is, and second, what working groups need to exist to bring it to fruition. Start with what’s needed, pay contributors well Not everything can be bounty-based or highly free-form. Certain positions and certain DAOs need to be equivalent to salaried jobs. The individuals who hold these posts, however, should be both those who have the backgrounds that are most needed to drive the DAO forward and the drive to actually do so. Take VitaDAO, for example. Longevity researchers, scientists, and funding experts should qualify as core contributors. Others can fall along different tiers, still compensated for what they do to further the DAO’s mission. The reason why is simple. VitaDAO exists to tackle “aging with the power of a global community.” Who better to drive that effort than experts in the field? Others like Bankless DAO can be more distributed in their approach to who qualifies as core contributors, by design. Onboarding the next 1 billion people to crypto is an effort that just about anyone in the space can equally contribute to. In the end, there’s no one size fits all mold for DAO compensation but we can take pieces from our compatriots\u0027 approaches and apply them to what we do now and in the future. Moreover, we can develop better structures together. - Samudai, a DAO project management platform that enables collaboration and bounty management for admins, project managers, and contributors, is the hub for all on-chain work and collaboration, dedicated to spearheading the future of work.

    "title": "Five Tips for Managing Your Risks in DeFi",
    "detailedContent": "Decentralized finance (DeFi) offers unparalleled opportunities for investors and users alike. However, with great potential comes inherent risks. DeFi, driven by blockchain technology and smart contracts, introduces unique challenges that require careful consideration. In this article, we dive into five essential tips designed to help you effectively manage the broader risks. By understanding the intricacies of DeFi protocols, evaluating smart contract security, gauging counterparty risks, assessing market and financial vulnerabilities, and staying informed about industry developments, you can further empower yourself to navigate DeFi with confidence. 1. Understand the Protocol Before investing in or using a DeFi protocol, thoroughly understand its purpose, mechanics, and value proposition. A clear understanding of how the protocol works and what problem it aims to solve will help you assess its potential risks and rewards. Delve deep into the mechanics of the protocol. Understand how it operates, from the entry of assets to the execution of smart contracts and eventual outcomes. Comprehend the various components, interactions, and processes involved, whether it\u0027s automated market makers, yield farming, lending, borrowing, or any other functionality. 2. Assess Smart Contract Risk Smart contract risk focuses on the technical security of a platform based on its underlying code. While you don\u0027t necessarily need to be a developer, having a basic understanding of smart contract principles will allow you to gauge the protocol\u0027s complexity and assess the potential for vulnerabilities. It should go without saying that you should carefully review every smart contract transaction you make before signing. Perhaps less obvious is the need to familiarize yourself with how to read data from blockchain explorers such as Etherscan. Taking the time to actually learn to read smart contracts this way will empower you to stay safe as you interact. Investors should also consider the maturity of the smart contract deployment and its associated underlying pool contracts. Evaluate the quantity and credibility of audits conducted; remember that auditors can differ in their effectiveness based on past outcomes. Additionally, inquire into the platform\u0027s history of security breaches by checking on DeFiLlama. If any exploits have transpired, assess whether the detected vulnerabilities have been rectified, followed by a thorough audit to ensure resolution. 3. Evaluate Counterparty Risk Counterparty risk evaluation encompasses both the centralization of the platform and its governance structure, serving as a proxy for assessing counterparty risk within the DeFi ecosystem. Admin access involves the presence of admin keys, allowing protocol developers to modify smart contract parameters, posing potential financial risks. Countermeasures such as timelocks and multi-signature wallets aim to mitigate these risks. Token holders signify the number of parties controlling the protocol, influencing governance attack vulnerabilities. A larger and more diverse holder base can reduce such risks. Oracle-related risks arise from potential manipulation or malfunctions that could lead to financial losses. Decentralized oracles offer resilience against manipulation, although they might not always reflect fair market values. Network security evaluates the underlying security of platforms based on the blockchain they utilize, with Ethereum being a trusted option. Team expertise and reputation, along with project backers, are crucial indicators of a project\u0027s credibility. These elements collectively contribute to a comprehensive platform risk assessment, which aids investors in making informed decisions within the DeFi landscape. 4. Determine Market and Financial Risk Market risks are intricately interwoven with the scale of the DeFi market and the dynamic fluctuations in supply, demand, and trading volumes. These risks carry particular relevance in relation to the protocol\u0027s assets, primarily the collateral. Enhanced performance in these facets directly translates to diminished susceptibility to liquidity crises, challenges in liquidation processes, and potential scenarios resembling bank runs. The evaluation of market cap serves as a gauge of platform adoption and its influence within the market. TVL, or total value locked, showcases the cumulative value of assets staked within a specific protocol. Meanwhile, the utilization ratio provides insights into the probability of scenarios akin to bank runs, calculated by dividing total borrows by total liquidity. The quality of collateral significantly impacts the effectiveness of overcollateralization, relying on the stability and reliability of the collateral itself. Through meticulous consideration and comprehensive assessment of these factors, investors can cultivate a heightened understanding of the inherent market risks that underlie DeFi protocols. 5. Stay Informed In the swiftly evolving realm of DeFi, staying updated is pivotal. It enables you to embrace new opportunities, navigate risks, and understand market trends. The dynamic nature of DeFi introduces constant innovations, making it crucial to stay informed. Trusted news sources and active engagement in social media and community forums provide insights into the industry pulse. This practice empowers decision making, readies you for challenges, and positions you at the forefront of DeFi\u0027s groundbreaking developments.

    "title": "Blockchain Diplomas: The Disruption of Traditional Education Credentials",
    "detailedContent": "As the world becomes increasingly digital, traditional systems are being disrupted across industries, and education is no exception. One area that\u0027s ripe for transformation is the way we handle education credentials. Enter blockchain technology – a game-changer that has the potential to revolutionize how we verify and share educational achievements. Revising Traditional Credentials Traditional education credentials, such as diplomas and degrees, have long been considered the gold standard for verifying educational achievements. However, they come with their own set of challenges. The verification process is often time-consuming, involving manual checks, paperwork, and third-party interventions. This can lead to inefficiencies, errors, and delays in the recognition of an individual\u0027s educational accomplishments. Moreover, the risk of credential fraud and fake certificates remains a significant concern. Enter blockchain. The technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin offers a decentralized and immutable ledger that has the potential to address many of the shortcomings of traditional credentialing systems. Each piece of information, such as educational achievements, is stored as a \"block\" on the blockchain. These blocks are linked in a chronological and secure sequence, creating an unalterable record. This means that once educational data is recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be modified or tampered with, ensuring the integrity of the credentials. Advantages of Blockchain Diplomas The disruption of traditional education credentials by blockchain technology brings forth a range of advantages. First and foremost is the issue of verification. With blockchain diplomas, the need for time-consuming and costly manual verification processes is eliminated. Instead, individuals can provide access to their verifiable blockchain-based credentials with a simple digital signature, allowing employers and educational institutions to instantly validate the authenticity of the information. This not only saves time and resources but also enhances trust in the credentialing process. Another significant advantage is the portability and ownership of credentials. With blockchain diplomas, individuals can maintain ownership of their educational achievements throughout their lives. This empowers learners to easily share their credentials with potential employers, institutions, and other relevant parties, without the need for intermediaries. As a result, individuals have greater control over their own educational data and can present a comprehensive and verified picture of their qualifications. Enhancing Opportunities Blockchain diplomas also have the potential to open up new opportunities for lifelong learning and micro-credentials. As the job market evolves, individuals are increasingly seeking continuous upskilling and specialized training. Blockchain technology enables the creation of micro-credentials, which are smaller units of educational achievements. These can include specific courses, workshops, and projects completed. By recording these micro-credentials on the blockchain, individuals can showcase their diverse skill set and ongoing commitment to learning, making them more competitive in the job market. Challenges and Considerations While the potential of blockchain diplomas is immense, there are challenges to address. One key concern is the standardization of data formats and verification protocols across different educational institutions and platforms. Interoperability is crucial to ensure that blockchain diplomas are universally recognized and accepted. Additionally, data privacy and security are paramount. Several initiatives are already underway to implement blockchain diplomas and take on this challenge. For instance, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) issued blockchain-based digital diplomas to a select group of graduates. This move aimed to explore the potential of blockchain in increasing the security and accessibility of educational credentials. Similarly, the University of Bahrain has partnered with Learning Machine, a blockchain credentialing provider, to issue digital diplomas to its graduates. Another initiative is the Open Campus ID, a universal student ID in the form of an NFT. The idea behind Open Campus ID is to empower learners to own and carry their achievements with them across different learning platforms and, on the flip side, allow institutions and employers to access their records in a verifiable, tamper-proof manner while preserving the learner’s privacy. This is made possible through decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and zero-knowledge proofs, technologies that Open Campus plans to make a core pillar of the protocol’s technology stack. Traditional identity management systems often collect vast amounts of personal data, raising concerns about potential breaches or misuse of this information. Open Campus ID, a Web3-enabled digital identity solution, on the other hand, adopts a privacy-first approach by leveraging novel technologies such as zero-knowledge proofs. Learners also have the ability to share specific attributes or credentials without revealing their entire identity. Looking Forward As blockchain technology continues to evolve, its impact on education is becoming increasingly apparent. Blockchain diplomas have the potential to disrupt the traditional credentialing landscape by offering secure, verifiable, and portable credentials. This innovation not only streamlines the verification process but also empowers individuals to take control of their educational achievements. While challenges remain, the promise of a more efficient, transparent, and learner-centric credentialing system makes blockchain diplomas a compelling proposition for the future of education. - Will Fan is CEO and Head of School at NewCampus, a modern business school for hypergrowth leaders in Asia.

    "title": "5 Use Cases for Zero-Knowledge Proofs in Machine Learning",
    "detailedContent": "Machine learning models rely on massive amounts of data to churn out accurate outputs that seem almost magical in their ability to understand us. But, as the amount of data ingested into machine learning projects grows, privacy flaws will become increasingly apparent — and there may be a tipping point where users are no longer willing to trade their privacy for the output. Before the industry develops further, models need to have a layer of accountability built in. Users need to trust that their data won’t be abused, that the model hasn’t been altered or hacked, and that models meet rigorous data privacy standards. Right now, the standard isn’t being met — but we have the opportunity to change that. Zero-knowledge proofs are one way for developers to create and run machine learning models that prove a computation was done correctly, while being free to choose which properties to make public. The result is the best of both worlds: personalized outputs based on secure, trustworthy models. We see a growing number of real world use cases for zero-knowledge proofs that could provide safeguards as the technology reaches its full potential. Real life applications for zero-knowledge proofs Machine learning will touch every part of our lives in the future, whether we want it to or not. We’re currently in the unique position of being able to add a layer of security in several key use cases, both on-chain (public transactions carried out on a blockchain) and off-chain (transactions confirmed outside of the main blockchain network). On-chain use cases Creating privacy-preserving credit scores When crypto traders borrow, the lender needs to be sure the borrower is trustworthy. Borrowers may be operating internationally and even pseudonymously. A machine learning model can be used to assess the creditworthiness of borrowers in a way that preserves privacy, so borrowers can be matched with lenders that best meet their needs. Building private know-your-customer (KYC) processes As part of the KYC process, new users are often asked to upload a photo of their driver’s license and then perform some form of a liveness test, involving looking into their webcam and turning their head. To protect the user’s personal privacy, a machine learning model could be built leveraging zero knowledge that performs the liveness test, checks it against a user’s driver\u0027s license photo, and returns a score for how closely they match along with a proof indicating the model was run accurately. Generating accurate stablecoin exchange rates Oracles serve an essential purpose by bringing off-chain data on-chain, which is important because smart contracts can’t get to information outside of the blockchain network. They are often used in stablecoins, where the security assumptions rely on regular and timely reporting of an exchange rate between an asset (for example, ETH) and a stablecoin which is supposed to remain pegged to a real-world currency. Machine learning can help make this reporting more accurate and robust, while zero-knowledge proofs guarantee that the oracle performed the computation correctly. Off-chain use cases Safeguarding the use of machine learning in high-assurance industries When lives depend on it, it’s critical to know that machine learning models produce trustworthy results that haven’t been altered or hacked by malicious actors. Any machine learning models used in the military, AI-piloted cars, or medical imaging and diagnostics, for example, should have extra validation software that can validate a zero-knowledge proof that sensor input has been analyzed correctly. Protecting proprietary machine learning models Many companies have already built private machine-learning models that they don’t want to share publicly. Since these models may have been trained on proprietary data or used in highly regulated industries, it may become important to prove that a result came from that specific model. Conclusion As machine learning and AI enter our daily lives, it’s more important than ever for us to trust the models and data used to generate outputs that impact the safety of our world. Platforms like Aleo make developing zero-knowledge algorithms simple thanks to the private by default, programmable platform. Machine learning developers can focus on doing what they do best: creating the algorithms and models that provide new insights into our world. - Frank Chen is the Head of Product at Aleo — the leading zero-knowledge proof-based developer platform for building fully-private, scalable, and cost-effective decentralized applications — where he leads consumer product efforts.

    "title": "These Five Pillars Will Bring Web3 Communication to the Next Billion Users",
    "detailedContent": "By Harsh Rajat, co-founder and lead of Push Protocol Communication! We can\u0027t get very far without it. From our earliest civilizations to the infrastructure that powers our most revolutionary products, communication lies at the core of how we connect to the world. Like technology itself (and in many ways because of it), how we communicate has drastically evolved, a process that hasn\u0027t been without its challenges. Through the innovation of next-generation technologies like web3, we\u0027re experiencing intuitive, new opportunities for seamlessly communicating with each other via applications that don\u0027t force us to rely on centralized web2 services such as email, social media, or text messages. Web3 has a lot of work to do to simplify access, security, and functionality within products (i.e., decentralized applications) if we\u0027re to onboard the next billion users — and keep them. Something as simple as communication is a use case and sector loaded with value and opportunity to bring more people to web3, serving as a bridge between dapps and users through the power of notifications, chat messages, and more across blockchain networks. Here are five pillars — and revolutionary features — that will bring web3 communication to the next billion users. ACCESSIBILITY: Inviting Chat Features that Mirror the Familiarity of SMS Can any of us remember a world before text messaging? SMS set the standard for how easily we can communicate across various connected devices, from phones to embedded web applications to, most recently, AI chatbots like ChatGPT. Web3-enabled communication must follow suit, mirroring the simplicity of text messaging to allow us to easily send and receive familiar chat messages across web3 environments like wallets. Speaking of wallets… PRIVACY: Wallet-to-Wallet Communication Chatting across text messages and social media DMs thrive in its simplicity and user experience but not in privacy. The centralized environments we often communicate in are not owned and controlled by us but by corporations that monitor our data and use it to sell ads. Web3 communication, where we utilize our wallet addresses to send and receive messages, offers a secure and privacy-focused alternative to traditional messaging apps. By leveraging blockchain technology, we can communicate directly via our wallet addresses without personal identifiers like phone numbers. It\u0027s the best of both worlds — web3 privacy and web2 functionality. CUSTOMIZATION: Web3-Enabled Push Notifications Have you ever asked yourself, \u0027Why am I receiving this notification — and more importantly, how do I turn it off?\u0027 While notifications can help keep us on track and in the loop, they\u0027re often at the expense of our control, privacy, and desire (another centralized tactic to monitor our digital identities). In web3 communication, however, we gain oversight and control over how we send/receive notifications and where. Through the power of features like \"delegated notifications,\" pre-approved channel owners can control who can send notifications on behalf of specific channels — and receivers on the wallet end can easily opt-out at any time (without relying on \"unsubscribe\" buttons buried within our crowded email inboxes). FLEXIBILITY: Multi-Chain Communication If we\u0027re going to onboard more users to web3, we have to give them more options of where to engage — and chat! Can you imagine if every mobile phone company had its own SMS, and if you didn\u0027t use it, you couldn\u0027t send and receive messages? Anyone who\u0027s caught flack for being the one Android user in a group chat of iPhones knows that even two SMS systems can cause friction. Web3 communication levels the playing field, allowing users across countless supported blockchains to chat easily via the same decentralized infrastructure. Say goodbye to the Battle of the Text Bubbles! DYNAMIC FORMATS: NFT, Video Chat and Audio Spaces Platforms like Discord, WhatsApp, and Zoom have revolutionized the communication space by giving us countless formats — video, text, audio, and so on. Now imagine the dynamism of chat formats without the centralized dangers (and inefficiencies) of bots, unwanted ads and notifications, and expensive tiered access. In web3 communication, any smart contract and wallet can communicate via video, text, push notifications, DAOs, groups, and NFTs. Web3 is changing how we create content, trade assets, build products, and grow communities. At the core of all of these exciting innovations is our ability to communicate; it’s essential that these conversations and connections should leverage the same unique pillars and features that enable web3 to enhance and reshape the systems of our everyday lives. If we stick to that mission, there\u0027s no telling how far these conversations — and products — can go. - Harsh Rajat is the founder and Project Lead of Push Protocol (formerly EPNS).

    "title": "How Web3 Technology Can Enhance Web2 Loyalty Programs",
    "detailedContent": "Consumers are moving away from their favorite brand. In fact, 71% of consumers admit they’ve switched brands in search of better deals. In this challenging and oversaturated market, brands are unable to maintain, nevertheless grow, their customer base. The future lies in community-powered initiatives that foster mutual commitments and create a culture of customers with shared values. Implementing web3 technology into loyalty programs can offer interoperability, value creation, and provide support and access to brands in new ways. A few key improvements that web3 technology and blockchain-based loyalty programs can provide include: 1. Interoperability: Currently, loyalty points or rewards are often restricted to specific platforms, limiting their usefulness. With web3, loyalty tokens can be standardized and easily transferred between different loyalty programs, allowing users to accumulate and redeem rewards easier. In late 2022, VISA announced a partnership with ShopNEXT, a web3-specific loyalty program for Visa card holders to earn rewards on top of payment transactions which can then be used for digital shopping through a multitude of verticals. 2. Tokenization and Ownership: Web3 allows loyalty tokens to be tokenized, meaning they can exist as unique digital assets on the blockchain. This allows users to truly own and control their loyalty rewards which opens up possibilities for fractional ownership, enabling users to trade or sell their loyalty tokens on decentralized marketplaces. Tiffany \u0026 Co provided token-gated access for CryptoPunks holders, tapping into their existing strong community. In August 2022, Tiffany partnered with Crypto Punks in August 2022 allowing existing CryptoPunk owners to have their own CryptoPunk Tiffany \u0026 Co pendant for 30 ETH. 3. Gamification and engagement: Web3 can enhance user engagement by introducing gamification elements into loyalty programs. By leveraging smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps), loyalty programs can create interactive and immersive experiences, such as loyalty-based games, challenges, or competitions. In 2021, Nike launched NIKELAND, a free sports immersion in the metaverse where users can earn tokens that translate to currency for digital apparel. 4. Community Engagement and Governance: Web3 supports the creation of loyalty program communities where users can actively participate in the program\u0027s governance and decision-making processes. Users within this loyalty program can propose and vote on program changes, influencing the direction of the program and fostering a sense of community ownership. Many web3 projects have implemented decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to further the development of projects and to put the power of decision-making directly into the hands of the users and consumers. For example, Decentraland, one of the largest browser-based metaverses, uses a DAO structure as the decision-making tool for MANA, NAMES and LAND holders. The DAO controls decisions such as harmful or offensive names not allowed in Decentraland, lists of notable locations to be promoted to users in the virtual world, the list of community run servers that host the world and more. 5. Programmable and Automated Rewards: With web3, loyalty programs can leverage smart contracts to automate reward distribution based on predefined conditions and rules. For example, loyalty tokens can be automatically issued when a user completes a specific action or reaches a predetermined milestone. This programmability reduces administrative overhead and ensures timely and accurate reward distribution. Starbucks launched Starbucks Odyssey in September 2022 providing the opportunity for users to earn and purchase digital collectible assets that will unlock access to new benefits and immersive coffee experiences including special events and immersive Starbucks Reserve stores. The future of web3 loyalty programs will be shaped by ongoing developments in web3 technologies, regulatory considerations, and market dynamics. As adoption and understanding of web3 grow, companies have the opportunity to reimagine loyalty programs, opening up more value to customers and fostering stronger brand loyalty. - Craig DeWitt, is the co-founder and Head of Product for Supermojo, an NFT payment solution.

    "title": "ERC-4337: Driving Web3 Adoption for Wallet, NFTs, Decentralized Social and Beyond",
    "detailedContent": "The first wave of NFTs in the summer of 2021 (commonly known as “NFT summer”) can be classified as rigid in function, expensive (both in price tag and due to their skyrocketing gas fees), confusing to obtain, weak in security, and limited in their blockchain of origin — which for the majority of mints were Ethereum. But after billions of dollars of headline-grabbing sales, viral on-chain communities, congested chains, cost-intensive transactions, lost assets, and relatively limited use cases, change is finally in the air — and not just on one blockchain (Ethereum) or through its traditional token standard (ERC-721). Over the last year and more, our market has watched more blockchains and novel token standards grow to support the next wave of blockchain-powered use cases. Dynamic utility, lower costs, and innovative opportunities for security, access, and adoption have demonstrated promise and possibilities for longevity and adoption over hype. From BNB Chain to Solana and Polygon, SBTs (soulbound tokens) to the token standard covered in this piece — Ethereum’s latest upgrade, the ERC-4337 — the future of NFTs and wallets we store are looking increasingly innovative for developers, users, and web3 overall. ERC-4337: What it is and why it’s needed ERC-4337 stands for “Ethereum Request for Comment 4337.” This moniker has nothing to do with public relations, but a smart contract standard for account abstraction, which enables individual Ethereum wallets to act as a customizable smart contract. This novel concept brings to life various user and developer-focused innovations that help abstract away some of the complexities of crypto wallets, like switching networks, cryptographic signatures, and private key management. Through the power of account abstraction, we can empower users with powerful new features that help bypass certain key challenges in web3 that have contributed to the bottleneck in increasing mass adoption of decentralized applications. Below, let’s see what some of these features are and what value they bring. Social Recovery: Think of this like two-factor authorization (2FA) that’s become commonplace as a security standard across most social media, email, and web2 applications. In this case, if you lose your private keys, which grant you access to a web3 wallet like Metamask, you can recover access to your assets through 2FA connected to your phone, email or even biometrics without needing seed phrases. Signature Abstraction: Think of this like a mobile banking app. You can set automated limits on daily transfers, trades, or budgets for certain categories of transactions. By allowing users customization options to define their wallet’s authorization schemes, we can open up an entire range of possibilities. Example: the user can set rules to reject transfers over $500 USDC or require multi-party signatures for transactions above $50 USDC. Session Keys: Consider it like ‘Remember Me’ when signing onto your favorite web2 social application. By utilizing account abstraction, we can enable session keys that remember your wallet without the need to sign every little action on a web3 dApp. Batch Transactions: By batching transactions together, users can execute trades more efficiently and inexpensively. If you’ve ever swapped a token on Uniswap, you know how you have to sign the transaction multiple times (at least twice) to approve and execute that transaction. With account abstraction, we can batch those together, consume less gas and make the user experience less clunky and intimidating. Gas Delegation: This is crucial for the growth of web3 dApps, where congested blockchain often leads to high hefty price tags for users. This is especially apparent in NFTs, where in 2022, an anonymous Bored Ape buyer spent $45,000 in gas fees. By delegating the gas fees to others, or alternatively, an application taking over the responsibility for paying their users’ gas, we can fuel mass adoption in web3 by empowering more people to engage. No user wants to pay for a gas fee every time they perform an action on a dApp. By passing on that cost to the underlying platform, we enable alternate, novel business models that don’t rely on users transacting as much as humanly possible. Multi-Party Computation: Think of this one as ‘sign in with Google,’ but for web3 wallets. Instead of authorizing another application to log into an account for you, it allows you to enable (and require) multiple key signers, each holding their private data to trigger an action (like signing in with a private key) without revealing that action to the other parties. The potential of ERC-4337 in the future of web3 By offering developers and their applications the flexible, approachable, and intuitive features, ERC-4337 shows tremendous potential across multiple use cases, not just in NFTs, but any web3 sector that relies on tokenized assets and on-chain transactions (which is most!). From ease of access to lower transaction costs, approachable security features, and speed, ERC-4337 can help bring more users to growing corners of the blockchain sector like decentralized social apps, where tokenized content and on-chain identity feature warrant more accessibility for communities to engage, leverage wallets, and build audiences. Like any piece of technology that’s made it easier for humans to create and connect, ERC-4337 shows serious potential in ushering a new era of innovation and adoption. - Ryan Li is the Co-Founder of CyberConnect, web3’s earliest and biggest decentralized social network, focusing on building and scaling the next generation of decentralized social media platforms.

    "detailedContent": "By Antoni Zolciak and Matthew Niemerg Privacy can exist on a spectrum. When it comes to this hot topic, it’s easy to think in absolute terms. But the unfortunate truth is that this is rarely a binary, even in real life. This conversation is increasingly important as different jurisdictions start to regulate the roles of individuals, businesses, and governments in the context of technology and privacy. We shouldn’t expect web3 to escape their impact. Moreover, we should understand that web3 has the potential to define the conversation going forward. This is why the conversations around controversies surrounding Arkham Intelligence and web3 privacy are especially important.

Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox, along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right, millions love us!) — what are you waiting for? Privacy, technology, and policy We’re always being selective about our privacy in everyday interactions. We choose to share identity, financial information, or personal interests to everyone ranging from close relatives to online strangers to large corporations to the government. These disclosures happen because that personal information is necessary to the other party and we expect to receive a service or good in return. For example, a company might need your financial information to process a payment or your identity in order to comply with KYC or AML. At the end of the day, individual and enterprise users alike have a right to customize their own privacy settings depending on the context. We should think about online privacy in the same way. True privacy means that everyone fully owns their information and can be selective about how to share it. In a functioning society, this will sometimes mean making disclosures to satisfy business terms or legal requirements. The goal is to make users aware of what, how, why, and who they share their sensitive details with and give them proper tools to manage the process. Revealing secrets selectively There’s a reason, however, why we’ve become used to talking about privacy in the wrong way. The internet’s current server-based architecture lets a handful of centralized entities collect and manage the information of billions of users. As a result, people think about privacy as a “take it or leave it” deal in exchange for convenience. But now we’re at a place where we can digitally emulate real life when it comes to privacy. Web3’s infrastructure puts users back in a position where they can access company services while their information stays with them and not in a remote server. Zero-knowledge proofs even lets them prove claims without revealing any information at all. Whose choice is it? All of this leaves us with the question of who gets to choose what. There’s a balance to strike in terms of how information is shared between individuals, businesses, and government institutions. Individual prerogative The decision to reveal personal information should always remain in the hands of individuals. However, government institutions will still choose when and how to enforce their own terms. This leaves individuals in a position where they’re incentivized to provide information on their own in return for a service, benefit, or protection. A perfect example of how this exists with the European GDPR regulations. Here, individuals always have the option to opt-out of any data exchange before every interaction. This lets them retain their agency. At the same time, it provides businesses the guidelines to operate effectively and within defined boundaries. Business models Just as individuals can define their own privacy decisions, businesses also have a right to enforce their own policy requirements. It wouldn’t be disagreeable for businesses that rely on ad revenue to require certain disclosures in exchange for better services. Both ends of the market can decide what to accept and reject, without a centralized middle man. But we’re seeing recent legislation that could tilt the balance too far in the opposite direction of GDPR. Florida’s “Digital Bill of Rights” (SB262) will require digital services to disclose important competitive information about their business models and comply with individual privacy requests that are operationally unfeasible. Government protection This leads us to the role of governments. It would be naive to expect that governments won\u0027t maintain some degree of enforceability over critical information, especially in matters of national security. Everyday concerns matter, too. The INFORM Consumers Act offers clear protections for buyers against the epidemic of counterfeit goods that exists in online marketplaces. The new regulation rightfully requires platforms to verify vendors\u0027 identities to ensure consumer protection against fraud. The right understanding This is not to say that heavy-handed actions enforced by government institutions are justified. A lot of the fear mongering around web3 privacy is due to a fundamental misunderstanding by regulators on how anonymous transfers actually work. In most of the privacy-preserving protocols in web3 there exists a cryptographic way for a user to reveal the origin of the transaction through approaches such as view keys. This gives users the ability to remove anonymity at their discretion. “Their discretion” being key here. Web3 simply makes privacy more negotiable than ever. Still, there are certainly new lines to be drawn. But they should be in line with the right understanding of web3 technology. In terms of regulatory approach, the outlook on how to regulate the roles of individuals, businesses, and governments should be one of guaranteeing this “negotiability” of privacy. Intelligence exchanges and where privacy matters We should examine new developments around privacy in web3 and Arkham Intelligence’s dox-to-earn business model under this light. We live in a world where everything and anything can be monetized and sometimes the pursuit of profit fails to consider the longer-term detrimental effects on a free society. This disregard for consequences can jeopardize the safety and well-being of individuals and groups. Moreover, the consequences extend beyond personal finances. There is a genuine risk of exposing wallet addresses, as well as the personal information of family members such as children, parents, siblings, spouses, and friends. An Intelligence Exchange aims to undermine the financial privacy of individuals within the web3 space. By doing so, it fosters a culture that undermines the significance of financial privacy and privacy in general. This business model takes away the individual prerogative to privacy and leaves it at the mercy of online mobs. Such reckless exposure has the potential to place individuals in harm’s way, calling for the role of governments to ensure their safety. If web3 returns privacy to its rightful place as an individual prerogative and makes it negotiable, a service like Arkham should be the right focus for regulatory discussions. - The Aleph Zero blockchain was founded in 2018 to enable a fast, secure, scalable, and privacy-preserving environment for Web3 builders.

    "title": "From Classroom to Blockchain: How Crypto Fuels Education Companies",
    "detailedContent": "The world of education is evolving rapidly, and with it comes the pressing need for innovative financing solutions. With the number of venture capital deals dropping 50% year-over-year, conventional funding avenues often fall short in meeting the diverse needs of education companies seeking to scale their operations and expand their impact. With the recent announcement of the US$10M Web3 Global Educators Fund by Open Campus, this draws attention in leveraging alternative financing asset classes, such as cryptocurrency, to drive the growth and transformation of education companies. The Advantages of Crypto for Education Financing One of the key highlights is the decentralized nature of blockchain, which breaks down the barriers that traditional funding sources often impose. With crypto, education companies gain access to a global pool of investors and backers, liberating them from the constraints of geographical boundaries and rigid regulations. With the gaming industry paving the way, this open and borderless approach democratizes capital, allowing more players to participate and invest in the future of education. The transparency and security that crypto offers are equally compelling. Blockchain technology ensures that financial transactions are recorded immutably, creating a trust-driven environment where accountability takes center stage. In an industry where trust is vital, the immutable nature of blockchain instills confidence among stakeholders, from investors to learners. As we venture into this exciting era of education financing, embracing the power of crypto will unlock a wealth of opportunities for growth and innovation. Tokenization and Incentives By harnessing the power of blockchain networks, education companies can revolutionize how they reward and motivate learners and educators. Through the creation of unique tokens, students are empowered with a sense of ownership and recognition for their achievements, fueling their drive to actively participate in their educational journey. Gamification of learning isn’t new. This culture of continuous learning not only boosts learner retention but also fosters a thriving educational community that celebrates growth. With crypto-driven incentives, education companies can go beyond traditional reward structures, offering learners tangible and transferable assets. These tokens hold real value within the ecosystem, opening up new avenues for learners to unlock additional educational resources or even trade tokens with others. Such gamification of education not only deepens learner engagement but also encourages collaboration and knowledge-sharing among peers. As we embrace this exciting era of crypto-powered education, the potential for innovation and learner empowerment is boundless. Collaborative Learning and Content Creation With blockchain technology, education companies can foster a culture of collaborative learning and content creation like never before. By harnessing the decentralized nature of blockchain, institutions, educators and learners can seamlessly come together, exchanging ideas, sharing resources, and co-creating educational materials. This collaborative approach breaks down the barriers of traditional silos, encouraging a diverse range of perspectives and expertise to shape the educational landscape. Blockchain\u0027s transparent and immutable nature also ensures the authenticity and credibility of educational content. By leveraging blockchain for content creation, education companies can provide learners with verified and trustworthy resources, enhancing the overall quality of education. The power of collaboration and content creation on the blockchain not only revolutionizes the learning experience but also cultivates a sense of community and shared purpose among learners and educators. Addressing Challenges and Mitigating Risks When venturing into the world of crypto financing, education companies need to be mindful of the challenges and risks that come with this disruptive technology. Regulatory uncertainties and market volatility can create uncertainty, but proactive planning and staying informed on evolving regulations can help navigate these hurdles. Implementing strong security measures is also paramount to safeguarding the financial interests of learners and stakeholders. It\u0027s essential for education companies to approach crypto financing with a balanced mindset, embracing the benefits while taking prudent steps to address potential risks. With a commitment to compliance and a focus on building trust among investors and learners, education companies can establish a solid foundation for sustainable innovation. Looking Forward The education sector stands on the precipice of transformation, and crypto presents a remarkable opportunity for financing growth. By embracing the principles of decentralization, tokenization, and collaboration, education companies can unleash their true potential and make a lasting impact on learners worldwide. The path ahead may be novel and challenging, but it\u0027s one that daring education entrepreneurs must explore to unlock the full potential of their vision. - Will Fan is CEO and Head of School at NewCampus, a modern business school for hypergrowth leaders in Asia.

    "title": "Web3 Is Getting a Larger Hard Drive, Now It Needs a Faster Processor",
    "detailedContent": "By Felipe Argento and Brandon J. Isaacson The blockchain technology stack is tasked with serving several crucial functions. Until relatively recently, these were all performed by individual L1 blockchains like Ethereum. This setup, known as a monolithic blockchain, doesn’t scale very well. Scaling solutions like rollups are a good way to offload some responsibility from L1s while maintaining roughly the same security guarantees. One type of rollup that is gaining in popularity – application-specific rollups – is poised to scale computation and drive a new wave of innovation in Web3. The scalability issue at a glance To understand why monolithic blockchains struggle to scale, we need to get a bit into the weeds. When one chain is handling every function — consensus, data availability, and execution — a single set of nodes is called upon to verify each and every action, by every DApp and user in the network. This can overload the system very quickly. As usage increases, DApps and users start competing for the chain’s finite blockspace, which becomes an unmanageably scarce resource. The result is that DApps and users who can’t win blockspace bidding wars are excluded from participating. This monolithic setup eventually degenerates into high fees and poses an ever-growing entry barrier for projects and users alike. For example, right now, a single popular NFT mint or highly anticipated airdrop can still render the Ethereum network unusable for nearly everyone else. The “shared” rollup approach To address some of these scaling issues, Ethereum pivoted in late 2020 to a rollup-centric roadmap. Rollups are a way of delegating important functions to systems running outside of the base chain. They then consolidate the results and add them to the underlying blockchain using cryptography techniques like fraud proofs and validity proofs. The rollup-centric path was rooted in the idea that scalability constraints on Ethereum can be broken down into two discrete issues: data scalability and computational scalability. What this means, in simple terms, is that a blockchain’s usage can be limited by two fundamental problems: how much data it can store and how many tasks it can process. If we think of Ethereum as one large, shared computer, Ethereum shifted its focus to scaling how much data its blocks can hold (let’s view this as “upgrading its hard drive”), while delegating computational scalability (“upgrading its processor”) to rollups projects. The first major wave of rollups adoption began in 2021. The launch of Layer 2 (L2) projects like Arbitrum and Optimism was based on “shared” rollups architectures. The rollups from these projects are “shared” in the sense that each DApp on the protocol shares space inside a single rollup with other DApps deployed on the same L2. DApps deployed on shared rollups theoretically enjoy gains in computing power as long as the L2 is less congested than the underlying L1. But there’s a catch. With each DApp sharing space inside the same rollup, there’s still competition amongst DApps for the processing power of L2 validators. Just as is the case with monolithic blockchains, periods of heavy usage on shared rollups can cause L2 fees to spike to unpredictable levels. Ultimately, once a shared rollup gains enough popularity, it’s vulnerable to the same exact congestion and cost dynamics posed by a monolithic design. The “shared” rollup approach brings us back to square one — albeit with some buffer time. The arrival of appchains In search of maximum scalability, customizability, and fee predictability, projects, including Cartesi, are starting to move beyond shared rollup architectures. They’re finding that building on application-specific rollups (commonly referred to as appchains) can bring better results for computational scalability. Similar to shared rollups, application-specific rollups act as off-chain execution layers that inherit security and censorship guarantees from the Ethereum base layer. But now, instead of sharing space inside a single rollup, each DApp has its own dedicated rollup to process off-chain tasks. This setup not only solves the issue of bidding wars amongst applications, but also provides significant gains in computational scalability. With only one application per rollup, each DApp can now benefit from full, unshared computing power. Rather than competing in a zero-sum game for validator computing power, each DApp can have its own high-performing rollup chain. These gains in computing power open the design space for developers in a very meaningful way. DApps deployed on application-specific rollups can now begin to more closely mimic traditional software applications in terms of programmability, cost efficiency, fee predictability, and user experience. Moving forward: the cone of innovation Ethereum’s rollup-centric vision calls for a collective effort. For its part, Ethereum has several initiatives on its roadmap that are poised to scale data availability like EIP4844 and sharding. But for Web3 to reach its full innovative potential, rollups projects must continue to push the boundaries of decentralized computation. The figure below helps us visualize how scaling data and computation together can pave the way for previously impossible decentralized applications: Web3’s Cone of Innovation created by Cartesi core contributors On the x-axis, we see that data availability improves with the implementation of EIP4844 and sharding. On the y-axis, computational capacity scales as we move from a monolithic L1 blockchain, to shared rollups, to application-specific rollups. The blue area on the graph is what we can call Web3’s Cone of Innovation. As scaling progresses in both dimensions, more complex DApps become possible. By contrast, the gray areas outside the cone show what happens when data availability and computation don’t scale in tandem. (The applications and their positioning inside the cone aren’t intended to be taken as gospel. Rather, the figure is meant to provide an intuitive outlook on the growing horizon of decentralized applications.) The main takeaway is that gains in data availability can’t be fully utilized without concurrent gains in computational capacity, and vice-versa. Both need to grow together. Application-specific rollups are a prime solution for growing the Ethereum network’s processing power. - Felipe Argento is an advisor at the Cartesi Foundation, focusing on Layer 2 research and application.

    "title": "5 Ways Projects Can Strengthen Their Communities During a Bear Market",
    "detailedContent": "Crypto is no stranger to bear markets; the last few years have seen significant drawdown in valuations in this relatively new industry. Experienced web3 builders expect and sometimes even welcome bear markets, as they have the ability to “trim the fat” of the ecosystem and return attention from hyped use cases to core fundamentals. For many communities, however, bear markets are tough periods of disillusionment and slowed growth. It’s easy to give into this disillusion, but it’s also vital to recognize just how powerful a tokenized community can be in these periods in terms of support, knowledge-sharing and positivity. Here are five strategies to help communities thrive, especially during a bear market. 1. Roll Out a Content Calendar. Communities respond to consistency. Following the energy of a bull market, the crash can feel severe and discouraging to community members. A consistent content calendar provides the community with regular events, meetings and discussions to look forward to. This calendar should be carefully planned to provide a good balance of education, announcements, entertainment and community-building activities to attract various personas of community members. Depending on your project, these events can include developer office hours, safety and security talks, community feedback sessions, AMAs, sessions with external experts, and trending web3 topics. 2. Involve Members. People join communities for a variety of reasons, but they typically stay in them because they’ve found connection and alignment. During a bear market, it’s more important than ever to create experiences for members to mix and mingle. Whether it’s learning opportunities, multi-player games or open forums, testing out a variety of ways for individuals to build connections can help strengthen your community. Consider quizzes, contests and games that are managed within Discord and provide members with rewards (like POAPs) and points based on participation and success. 3. Grow Community-Born Leaders. There are some better strategies for growing strong communities like identifying, training and growing leaders from within. Community-born leaders have a special sense of insight into the community, and often hold a unique reputation among the rest of the members. Additionally, by involving members in leadership, the project gains valuable insight into what the community needs and wants. Bear markets are especially strong times to elevate these leaders, because you know who has stuck around through thick and thin. 4. Help Build Reputation. Bear markets are opportunities to identify your most loyal community members and provide them with additional value. There are many ways to do this, including tipping, NFT badges, Discord roles and verifiable credentials. These acknowledgements create a positive environment where community members know that their contributions are appreciated, and most importantly shareable. This type of relationship between community members and protocol is core to web3, and allows those individuals to ‘take’ their reputation with them. 5. Maintain a Positive Environment. It’s common to feel down in the bear market, but communities can be the wellsprings of positivity. Light-hearted activities and a collaborative communication style can go a long way in enhancing morale. Enjoyable events like meetups, game nights, and meme contests give your community a way to decompress and enjoy each others’ company and spread good vibes. Your goals during a bear market won’t look exactly like your goals during a bull market. Bear market goals should focus on keeping your community engaged and informed, being a beacon for support and relationships. Remember that a strong community can weather the storm, while preparing for the next bull market. - Collab.Land is a full-service automated member management system for tokenized communities.

    "title": "CoinMarketCap #REBUIDL — What Does The Future Hold And How Can We Move Forward?",
    "detailedContent": "For the last ten days or so, one topic has ruled them all in the crypto space: How the \u0026§%@ did FTX collapse and where do we go from here? CoinMarketCap Academy covered the bank run on FTX in great detail: In the Glassnode on-chain report The Fall of FTX. In our deep dive explainer of the FTX collapse. In our weekly Twitter round-up titled \"Bankrupt Altruism\". That answers the first part of the question. So, where do we go from here? That was covered on yesterday\u0027s CoinMarketCap Twitter Space #REBUIDL Crypto. CoinMarketCap’s mission has always been to provide fair data and education to the masses. With the recent FTX crisis affecting many, confidence in the industry has taken a hit. To help rebuild crypto together and support the community going through hard times, CoinMarketCap has gathered some of the industry-leading voices to discuss the path forward. If you missed it, we have a TLDR of the most important talking points from this illustrious line-up of guests: • Eowyn, CEO of TrustWallet • Dyma, CEO of Hacken • Pete Rizzo, Editor of Bitcoin Magazine • Austin Adams, Researcher at Uniswap • Andrew T, Content Lead at Nansen • Sam, Director of Community and Ecosystem at Circle • Vijay from Uniswap • Laura Shin, crypto journalist • Ritvik Carvalho from Binance • Adrian from BUSD On lessons from the previous bear market Most guests were around for the previous bear market, so everyone knows the drill. Eowyn pointed out that a bear market is the best time to see what remains and has value. It\u0027s also the best time to build new features and capabilities (something that TrustWallet plans to do). On the importance of self-custody Self-custody has been a major talking point since the FTX fiasco. Particularly, bitcoiners have been steadfastly reminding everyone of the importance of self-custody — can\u0027t get liquidated from a cold wallet after all! Pete reinforced that point: self-custody is the number one lesson and the reason why crypto exists in the first place. Still, the consensus was that custodians aren\u0027t going anywhere. Eowyn pointed out that centralized exchanges are here to stay since they provide the most liquidity. But even centralized exchanges have something to gain here. They can leverage on-chain verification of assets for audits (and, by extension, build trust with users), as Dyma from Hacken reminded listeners. On moving on from FTX by building The mood on Crypto Twitter ever since the bankruptcy has been defiant. This \u0027we ain\u0027t leaving\u0027 attitude is backed up by a focus on building, another big talking point of the Space. Two major points emerged as consensus: Building more on-chain audits and self-regulation. Bitcoiners have a natural tendency for skepticism, as Pete explained, so \"promoting a culture of scrutiny\" will do the space a lot of good. Andrew from Nansen agreed that more self-correction in the industry is necessary because regulators won\u0027t do a better job. Besides on-chain audits for CEXes, the robustness of DeFi proved itself to be a useful asset for the future. As Andrew rightly explained, DeFi overcollateralization and automatic liquidations have their strengths. Meanwhile, Austin Adams pointed out that with Uniswap, you don’t need to put your trust in people, but instead “you just have to put your trust in the code and that it works.” As an OG of the space, Pete remembered the sentiment after the Mt Gox collapse, which was very similar to what is happening today: winter is here, so time to dig in and build. On the crypto media coverage of FTX Another interesting topic was the crypto media coverage of the FTX collapse. Crypto journalist Laura Shin praised Coindesk for setting everything in motion by having the guts to break the story in the first place. Still, she rightly said that no one was interested in providing sources on SBF\u0027s flaws when things were going as planned — a reminder how difficult self-regulation of the industry can be. On lessons for the future Two points stood out in this last section: • Data literacy and \u0027on-chain fluency\u0027 is growing (also thanks to FTX). • This will help steer the industry back to its roots. Adrian from BUSD made a great point: Google has \"don\u0027t be evil\" so crypto can have \"can\u0027t be evil\" thanks to on-chain transparency. After all, it\u0027s all about who is trying to grow the industry and do good versus who\u0027s just in it for the money. Finally, Dyma also said that CoinMarketCap has “all the cards to bring trust and transparency back to our industry.” We are definitely working with that goal in mind! A story to keep in mind Even if you skip the two-hour long Space, the last six minutes are worth tuning into. @whatajkay tells his story of how he went from zero to hero (millions) on FTX and back to zero (thanks SBF!) and how to overcome \u0027getting rugged by life.\u0027 His takeaway: Life comes faster than you think, so focus on the future no matter what s**t happened to you yesterday.

    "summary": "Op-Ed: DYOR is your call to action, not a disclaimer.",
    "title": "Bull Market Mastery: 4 Crucial Ways To Do Your Own Research (DYOR)",
    "detailedContent": "Over the years, the phrase \"do your own research\" (DYOR) has become ubiquitous within the crypto community. While it is sound advice, the term has been largely reduced to a mere disclaimer that people use to sidestep responsibility when promoting their projects. This is not how it should be. As we enter the bull market, keep in mind that “DYOR” isn’t just some disclaimer-like catchphrase – it\u0027s an essential practice that separates savvy crypto users from gamblers. Done correctly, DYOR should help inform crucial crypto decisions, mitigate risks, and maximize opportunities. So, with markets heating up, here are the 4 most important things to zoom in on. 1. Onchain Data When figuring out your next big move, it’s essential to make informed decisions based on transparent data rather than relying solely on third-party opinions. This direct access ensures authenticity and transparency, enabling you to uncover insights that may otherwise be obscured. And while data analysis may seem relatively technical at a glance, a new generation of onchain data analytics tools make it easier than ever to dive into the data yourself, regardless of whether you’re a crypto veteran or new user. Onchain analytics tools like Flipside, Nansen, and Messari simplify access to important metrics such as active user count, token distribution, and protocol interactions across the web3 space. For DeFi projects, relevant data points to assess include TVL, trading volume, and liquidity pool dynamics. Note that most onchain data analytics tools require paid subscriptions, but there are free resources out there that let you dig through the data without ever spending a cent. For instance, Flipside lets you create your own custom queries using data from 25+ different blockchains and protocols and browse thousands of existing community-made dashboards for free. No single metric paints a complete picture of a project’s traction and potential, but being open to looking at the data yourself will go a long way toward helping you decipher what is actually taking place onchain. And while it’s often helpful to reference pre-configured and community-contributed dashboards, it’s ideal to dive deeper into the data with your own custom queries. 2. Developer Activity Developer activity provides insights into a project’s technical progress and long-term viability. Industry reports like Electric Capital’s Developer Report provide an interesting macro view of the web3 development landscape, but you’ll need to zoom into specific projects for more actionable insights. It’s often helpful to start with the public documentation listed on a project’s GitHub or GitLab. While these platforms may feel overwhelming at a glance if you’re not a developer, you can still gauge how active these projects are and gain additional context. Note that large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are increasingly capable of synthesizing code repositories and explaining what they do, which can help you to determine what a project is prioritizing and building. Additionally, many projects make a clear effort to attract and support developers to build with them on their network. As a result, it can be helpful to look through a project’s developer resources, including their Gitbook or documentation pages, and see whether they have any ecosystem grants or other builder incentive systems. 3. Community Activity Community is the lifeblood of any web3 project, but this is where most of the red herrings appear. At the end of the day, crypto influencers, analysts, and even regular community members or token holders have their own motivations. If someone finds a compelling market signal, it’s in their best interest to act on it early instead of broadcasting it to the world – so all advice or hopium you come across should be taken with a grain of salt, even if it seems well-intentioned. This doesn’t mean you should ignore all the signals scattered across the crypto social scene; you just need to do your best to filter out the noise, whether you are looking at X (formerly Twitter), Discord, Reddit or any other popular platforms. When assessing a project\u0027s community activity, consider engagement metrics such as the ratio of likes and comments to the project’s total follower count and the quality of third-party mentions. Watch out for red flags like high follower count accounts with low engagement, sudden spikes in followers not accompanied by similar increases in engagement, and generic, repetitive social posts. These patterns may indicate a project’s reliance on bots or other manipulative tactics to fluff its community growth figures. 4. Investors and Project Teams The composition of a project\u0027s key team members and investors can affect its credibility and likelihood of succeeding. Projects with a deep bench of credentialed founders and investors with successful, verifiable track records bring a lot of validation to their brand, and most projects mention key team members and investors on their website. From there, you can look into their respective Linkedin pages, social accounts, and other personal channels. It’s important to note that lesser-known or even anonymous project teams are not necessarily a negative indicator. But very few low-quality web3 projects manage to attract prominent team members with extensive experience in their respective fields. When researching these key players, be sure to take note of whether they publicly advocate for the project on their own social channels. The way these individuals communicate about the project in public can reflect their actual level of involvement and enthusiasm (or lack thereof), and highly engaged team members and investors can signal a project\u0027s strength. DYOR Is Your Call to Action, Not a Disclaimer The crypto community has been increasingly optimistic in recent months, following positive price trends and rumors about potential SEC-approved crypto funds around the corner. But money attracts attention, which is why every bull market is accompanied by a deluge of misinformation, scammers, and hackers. These conditions make it more difficult to discern which projects are high quality and worthy of your time and resources, and which are effectively well-marketed vaporware. But this is exactly why it’s so crucial to actually DYOR. As we enter the next bull market, let\u0027s embrace DYOR – not as a catchphrase to sidestep personal responsibility, but as a practical process that guides our interactions in the exciting and ever-evolving world of web3. - Jim Myers is an engineer, early-stage investor, and the CTO \u0026 Co-Founder of Flipside Crypto, a leading blockchain data analytics and business intelligence platform.

    "detailedContent": "There are many narratives around scalability in web3 and we should remember that they are just that: narratives. Their power lies in the way they frame problems, and, consequently, the way we solve them. In this sense, they are more like tools than final answers. Narratives around the problem of scalability are no different in that they can be useful when applied correctly. Perhaps we can ask ourselves what narratives around infrastructure are better for which kind of use cases. If we step outside of the dominant narratives around “layer n” solutions and the debate among monolithic versus modular blockchains, we find more elegant alternatives that can be better suited to end-user applications. The concept of microchains looks at scalability from a new perspective: that of scaling at the validator level instead of at the blockchain level. The result is an approach that prioritizes web3 applications that need to support an unlimited number of active users. The monolithic chain is dead; long live the monolithic chain Right now, if you ask a development team how they are building a web3 application, they will probably mention including a rollup solution or app-chain. This is because all the web3 applications that are built strictly on a layer-1 are in a constant tug-of-war for blockspace in the network. This is a historical problem. Since the early days of web3 development, we have expected to have “One Network to Rule them All,” or a singular chain that solves all problems. This monolithic view of scalability is unnecessary and has only made it harder for builders to offer users basic things like tolerable transaction speeds or efficient gas costs. As a result, both infrastructure projects and web3 application development teams have rightfully started to look for alternatives. Going layered? Going modular? As the web3 space has evolved, new projects use solutions like L2s and modular chains that help them offer more consistent and reliable user experiences. In recent years, we have seen a lot of development (and investment) focused on technologies like optimistic rollups, app-specific chains, and other layered or modular solutions. It’s easy to understand why modular scalability has been all the rage as of late. By taking a modular approach, L1 chains like Ethereum can focus on scaling only the essential properties of their networks. In turn, they delegate other non-essential scalability problems to third parties and leave room for a whole ecosystem of L2 solutions. In other words, by going for a modular approach to address scalability, they are leaving behind the idea of a monolithic chain and seeing scalability as an add-on. But are modular chains really the ideal, or end state, for blockchain scalability? As useful as they can be, they also introduce new problems, ranging from extra steps in the user journey to some security concerns (including incomplete fraud proof implementations, software bugs in ZK proofs, and front running by centralized entities.) Yet, for the past few years, the industry has been limited in thinking about the problem under these terms. This is because of a certain kind of path dependency: we\u0027re used to thinking about blockchain scalability in one way just because we’ve mimetically taken that as the starting point. These are historical reasons, not practical or technical reasons — and it does not have to be the case. Microchains: beyond the modular approach Let’s take a step back, reframe the problem. What if we could take a step back and design an L1 that scales from the start? We could even revisit the concept of the monolithic chain under a new light — not to go back to it, but to reimagine the main blockchain infrastructure from a more efficient perspective. We have the opportunity to scale a main blockchain infrastructure at the validator level, for web3 applications that can horizontally scale (in the first place). The key element to unlock these capabilities is a system where a set of honest and well-incentivized validators can run multiple — even infinite — lightweight chains in parallel. A similar situation already happens with validators who use their data centers to run on different L1s. Each of these chains — we call them microchains — can be much smaller in size than a typical L1 chain but still share in the same security guarantees of any large-scale delegated proof-of-stake blockchain network. Because they share the same validator set, they can easily share messages and operations between each other, reducing latency. Making room for the Personal Blockchain Beyond scalability, the real advantages of the microchain approach are seen in an improved user experience. Running an unlimited set of parallel chains means that every user could become a partial node for their own chain, with the ability to create their own blockspace as necessary. In this system, individual wallets are at the center, proposing their own blocks, and don’t compete for blockchain infrastructure resources. One way to look at microchains is to see them as a step away from monolithic blockchains and their layered, modular add-ons, and as a step towards what we could call The Personal Blockchain. Imagine every user having their own chain that interacts with other users’ chains and can create new blocks whenever they want. That’s an alternative that exists when we think outside of flavor-of-the-day narratives of web3 scalability. - Mathieu Baudet is the founder and CEO of Linera, the first low-latency blockchain designed to scale elastically through the introduction of microchains.

    "title": "DeFi Predictions for 2024: Private Credit in the Lower Middle Market",
    "detailedContent": "Is web3 alive and well, or is it fizzling out? That seems to be the question on a lot of people’s minds. It’s been a hard couple of years for the global economy at large. In the US, the Fed has taken extraordinary steps to bring inflation under control. It’s also been an incredibly hard couple of years for the crypto industry, exacerbated by large scale collapses stemming from poor risk management all the way to fraud. We are also in an environment of high regulatory uncertainty in the US. Bleak as it may sound, there is activity in web3 that is showing a lot of promise, particularly in private credit. Let’s do a deep dive. Historically private credit had focused on mezzanine loans or opportunistic debt opportunities. In recent years, banks have been growing their residential and commercial mortgage books while reducing exposure to commercial loans. While large issuers were able to raise money from bond issuances in the public capital markets, the wide gap in the middle market has been primarily filled by the private credit industry – currently at $1T in the US and about $1.7T globally. High yield corporate debt is currently providing around 9% yield (as of October 2023) and private credit commands an illiquidity premium of 150-300 bps for uni-tranche or senior debt, the spread increasing considerably for junior debt. Matching Demand and Supply The existing private credit market mostly caters to the middle market. While demand from the lower middle market has been high, supply of capital has always been constrained. This is because large asset allocators invest capital with managers who are unable to underwrite small-scale deals. Smaller institutional investors like family offices, global alternative investment funds etc., have traditionally faced two challenges: Finding high-quality deals for direct or syndicated investments A preference for some liquidity, though the underlying investments themselves may be fundamentally illiquid. Issuers, on the other hand, have not had platforms to avail private credit, often having to rely on high-cost bespoke deals with high net-worth investors. How Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Is Revolutionizing “Lower Middle Market” Private Credit In the past few years, we have seen DeFi lending evolve from fully decentralized overcollateralized crypto lending protocols like Compound and Aave, to protocols like Centrifuge, Goldfinch, Credix, Maple, Huma and others that are able to finance traditional “real world assets” (RWA) using DeFi rails. The spectrum of RWA financing covers diverse use cases comprising real estate financing, asset-based financing (receivables, inventory, and other assets), voluntary carbon offsets, advances (pay advance and royalties advance), receivables factoring and many others. Protocols focused on these use cases are either specializing in specific niches (e.g., Goldfinch focusing on lending to fintechs that lend to small businesses, or Huma focusing on providing receivables-backed financing to financial institutions), or geography-focused (e.g., Credix offering loans to fintechs or funding receivables factoring in Latin America). According to RWA.xyz, an on-chain analytics platform for RWA, the private credit market on DeFi rails is currently at about $550M of active loans. While still in nascence, given the size of the global lower middle market, this sector has huge potential for future growth. What Pain Points Are Being Solved by DeFi In addition to enabling new capital formation for global trade and commerce, there are specific advantages that are natively possible only on the Blockchain. Let us look at the example of Huma and its client Arf. Arf is radically transforming the status quo in the global remittance industry which has traditionally relied on pre-funded accounts (estimated at over $4T) across counterparties to enable fast settlements. Using the Huma platform, Arf can provide just in time credit to its Financial Institution (FI) clients and instantaneously settle with counterparties using USDC (fiat pegged stablecoin issued by Circle). Within 10 months, Arf has done over $400M of settlements on USDC and expects to get to $2B+ in annualized transaction volume in the near term. By freeing up capital locked in pre-funded accounts Arf can remove substantial capital and operational overhead for its clients. Erbil Karaman, co-founder, and CEO of Huma says: “According to the UN, about one in nine people globally rely on funds sent home by migrant workers. What Huma and Arf have achieved shows that remittance companies around the world can now operate with much greater efficiency and instantaneous settlement 24/7 anywhere in the world.” Also, given the short-term nature of these types of receivables, lenders and liquidity providers might have access to higher liquidity (e.g., 30-60 days redemption requests), rather than being locked into illiquid investments for years. What’s Next Stablecoins have achieved about $125B in market capitalization. As programmable money, they are poised to become the payment and settlement rails for web3, the value internet. However, until US regulations on stablecoins are clear, and a bill like H.R. 4766 comes to pass, there will continue to be uncertainty in the broader industry. But we are certainly starting to see major companies like Visa and Paypal getting actively involved in the space. Visa recently expanded stablecoin settlement capabilities with Circle’s USDC on the Solana blockchain, while Paypal, in partnership with Paxos announced the launch of its stablecoin PYUSD, on the Ethereum blockchain. There are still several issues pertaining to risk management that the DeFi private credit industry needs to solve, especially in a global context. In recent months we have seen private credit deals default on well-known platforms, demonstrating the need for good credit underwriting and ongoing performance monitoring. In time, these issues can either be addressed or somewhat mitigated. Various forms of credit enhancements (e.g., tranching, adding pool covers or cash collateralization) can also create layers of principal protection. I expect this industry to continue growing rapidly in 2024 and beyond. - Sanjay is the VP of web3 Initiatives of Roofstock onChain, the web3 subsidiary of Roofstock, where he leads the real estate investing platform’s blockchain initiative.

    "title": "DeFi\u0027s Trust Puzzle: What Institutions Need to Jump In",
    "detailedContent": "Decentralized finance (DeFi) is not just a fleeting trend. Anchored in its promise are financial inclusivity, democratization, and attractive yields. From delivering diverse investment avenues to spearheading technical innovations, to obliterating geographical barriers, DeFi is redefining the boundaries of financial engagement. For all of DeFi\u0027s seismic opportunities, traditional financial institutions remain conspicuously restrained. Their reservations are multifaceted. The concerns surrounding AML/KYC, data privacy, cybersecurity, gaps in governance models, the lack of recourse mechanisms, and the unclear legal terrain are all contributing factors. The palpable tension between the transformative promise of DeFi and the cautious reserve of institutional players underscores a defining moment for global finance. How these two financial domains converge, or diverge, will chart the path for the next era of finance. Navigating the DeFi Minefield: Risks and Roadblocks for Institutions At the heart of institutional reticence towards DeFi lies a complex web of challenges, each posing significant questions about the viability and long-term potential of these decentralized solutions. Security Concerns: The blockchain space is rife with tales of smart contract flaws leading to multi-million dollar losses. 2022 was the biggest year for lost funds yet, with over $3.8b lost. Notable hacks such as Ronin Bridge and Poly Network (over $600m each) have underscored that while blockchain transactions are immutable, they are not impervious. Data Privacy: Institutions catering to high-net-worth clients or specialized markets cannot afford the exposure of trading histories or positions, as it could tip off competitors or undermine strategic market moves. Over time, as data accrues, this openness can inadvertently reveal patterns or investor behaviors. Consider the phenomenon of \"whale tracking\" on platforms like Twitter and Telegram. These tools, utilized by a growing public, monitor substantial crypto-asset movements on decentralized exchanges and various DeFi platforms. This leads to widespread speculations about the identities of these \"whales\" – investors with significant crypto holdings. This level of visibility and the ensuing conjectures can sometimes be unsettling for participants who value discretion in their financial endeavors. Regulatory Uncertainties: The regulatory climate for DeFi remains in flux. Institutions, often under the microscope of regulators, must navigate this uncertain terrain with caution. The fear of future compliance pitfalls or regulatory backlash can be a significant deterrent. This year alone, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued both Coinbase and Binance for either trading or offering unregistered securities. The agency also issued a number of warnings and took steps to increase its scrutiny of the crypto industry by creating a dedicated Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit. AML/KYC Risk Controls: For many institutions, the permissionless nature of DeFi is both a boon and a bane. Ensuring AML/KYC compliance is pivotal, not only to mitigate legal risks but also to uphold institutional reputation by preventing inadvertent association with illicit activities or unsanctioned entities. The EU’s inaugural regulatory framework for crypto assets, Markets in Crypto-assets (MiCA), imposes a number of new requirements on providers of crypto asset services. Under MiCA, they must be authorized by a national competent authority, carry out AML/KYC checks, put limits on leverage, and disclose info about their products and services to consumers. Back in August of 2022, the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Tornado Cash, a cryptocurrency mixer that allows users to obscure the source and destination of their transactions. After alleging that Tornado Cash has been used to launder money for North Korean hackers, a number of exchanges and other crypto businesses delisted Tornado Cash which led to a decline in the price of its native token. Lack of Standardization: The DeFi landscape is diverse and evolving, with each platform often having its own set of rules and mechanisms. The absence of a universal standard or benchmark makes due diligence cumbersome and increases the risk of missteps. Mature Governance and Conduct Models: Institutions are accustomed to stringent governance and conduct models, ensuring transparency and accountability. The decentralized and sometimes opaque governance of DeFi protocols can be disconcerting. For DeFi to genuinely appeal to institutions, it must align with the professional standards expected in traditional finance. The Building Blocks for Institutional Trust The institutional hesitancy around DeFi, while warranted, can be addressed with targeted strategies that rebuild trust and reinforce the stability and security of the sector. Robust Security Measures: The DeFi world has to prioritize paramount security measures. This means regularly conducting in-depth smart contract audits, offering meaningful bug bounties to identify vulnerabilities, and promoting the use of multi-signature wallets to diversify security dependencies. Clear Regulatory Pathways: For institutional trust, ambiguity is the enemy. Collaborative dialogues between DeFi pioneers and regulators can pave a clear, compliant pathway, assuring institutions of the legitimacy of their decentralized endeavors. KYC/AML Initiatives: By integrating rigorous KYC and AML procedures, DeFi can strike the right balance between upholding user privacy and meeting stringent regulatory standards, thereby ensuring a more secure and accountable ecosystem. Awareness \u0026 Educational Initiatives: Misunderstanding breeds mistrust. By rolling out extensive training programs and resourceful guides, institutions can navigate DeFi with newfound confidence, dispelling myths and reinforcing knowledge. Interoperability and Standardization: DeFi stands to gain immensely from cross-chain solutions and standardized practices, fostering smoother, more predictable interactions across platforms. Transparent Governance: An open, decentralized governance model empowers community members, ensuring everyone has a voice. This collective oversight instills trust, as decisions are made transparently, reflecting the broader interests of the community. Conclusion By laying down these foundational blocks, the chasm between institutional reservations and the expansive potential of DeFi can be bridged, ushering in an era of harmonized financial innovation. - Akash Mahendra is Director of the Haven1 Foundation where he leads strategy, operations, and risk management efforts in support of Haven1 — an EVM-compatible L1 blockchain purpose-built to provide a secure environment for on-chain finance.

    "title": "Design Flexibility: The New Pinnacle of Web3 Development",
    "detailedContent": "Decentralized applications (dApps) are at the forefront of the web3 movement, offering a more open and user-centric internet. The development of these applications, however, is not without its challenges. In the long list of web3 hurdles that have been placed in front of web3 developers (security, scalability, UX, incentives), there’s another challenge that remains elusive and less discussed: design flexibility. The Current State of DApp Development In today’s world of traditional software, developers have a wealth of tools and libraries they use to build user-friendly applications. The options for today’s web2 developers are abundant — in short, their design options are flexible. In web3, by contrast, the constraints of the technology often limits developers. This is most obvious for applications built on Ethereum and executed in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Every smart contract interaction (i.e. every transaction) runs through the EVM, updating the network’s state in the process. Every transaction on the EVM incurs a gas cost; the more complex the transaction, the higher the cost. Blockspace is finite on Ethereum, so when rising gas costs and finite blockspace collide, a competitive environment arises. During times of high network demand, competition intensifies. Web3 users and dApps find themselves in bidding wars, vying for their transactions to be processed in earlier blocks and being forced to pay high fees to make it happen. This dynamic, however, doesn’t just translate to high costs. It fundamentally influences how dApps are designed in the first place. Developers are often forced to prioritize gas optimization over software functionality. The result is a development landscape where innovation is stifled and design choices are made not for user experience, but to compensate for the limitations of the underlying infrastructure. Today’s L2 Gas Solutions Gas cost and scalability are critical to the success of web3, and many layer 2 projects today aim to find a solution. By executing transactions off-chain, L2s promise less competition for blockspace. However, while these networks have alleviated some of the acute pressures of gas wars, they don’t fully address the core issue: design flexibility. Even with L2 solutions, dApps remain tethered to the EVM’s constraints. The competitive bidding dynamics between gas and blockspace are inherent to shared EVM spaces, which most of these L2s still are. Even if those pressures are reduced with today’s L2 rollup solutions, developers still find themselves making design compromises. The Search for a Better Development Environment The search for more design freedom has led projects to explore alternatives to the EVM, such as EVM+ and WASM. These alternatives allow developers to write smart contracts in more traditional programming languages like Rust and Python. The real power of traditional programming languages lies in their vast open source libraries. These libraries, built over decades of global developer input, offer pre-written, battle-tested solutions to complex problems. Developers use these libraries to build faster and more efficiently. These web2 libraries rely on an operating system that provides memory management, system hardware, security, and more. However, EVM alternatives cannot support an operating system precisely because of the computational limitations of shared environments in current L2s. This means that even with these “developer friendly” EVM alternatives, dApp developers can’t benefit from most open source libraries. Without those resources, even basic developer tasks remain cumbersome and inefficient. Finding the Right Path to Design Flexibility Reaching the pinnacle of design flexibility thus requires a few different innovations to intersect. First, the competition for blockspace and gas costs needs to be resolved so that developers can focus on the perfect dApp for users rather than the perfect dApp for gas optimizations. Once developers move from a shared environment into an app-specific one, the question becomes: \"what can be done with these massive gains in computing power?\" Now they’ll have the resources to build with full implementations of familiar programming languages rather than limited versions or web3-native languages. These languages need to be available alongside vast open source libraries that benefit from the global “hive mind” of developers. The need for all these intersections requires a fundamentally new approach to achieve design flexibility. Design flexibility is not a “nice to have” feature. It is a necessity for more web3 applications to move beyond intrigue and begin making noticeable, scalable changes to the way we operate online. It is up to the broader community to continue innovating to build the web3 future we all envision. - Felipe Argento is an advisor at the Cartesi Foundation, focusing on Layer 2 research and application.

    "title": "Transforming the Workforce: The Evolving Role of DAOs in Shaping the Future of Work",
    "detailedContent": "There has never been a more opportune moment to establish a DAO. Remote work is still on the ascent, displaying no signs of slowing down, and the gig and creator economies are also scaling up. The future will be defined by on-chain communities, where progress is driven not solely by individuals but by collectives. To get there, DAOs need to level up their approaches to governance, contributor engagement and retention, and improve compensation processes and methods. Here’s how we can move closer to that point. Move away from one token, one vote Judging on a per wallet basis, there are only approximately 2.5 million eligible voters in today’s DAOs. With roughly 676 DAOs in formally recorded existence and 330 of those averaging under 1000 token holders, the DAO space would appear to favor a select few. This is far from the ideal state of shifting the power of the firm and every community in existence back to the people that truly make them run. So what can be done? DAOs need to move away from the pay to play model and onto distributing voting power and ownership more equitably. One example would be a quadratic voting-inspired model where the square root of token weight (tokens owned) is taken to determine voting power, with another being a “DAO-based democracy,” where the whole DAO elects a certain number of officials to vote for it on all issues. Since most DAOs are still one token, one vote, it’s early, but organizations like Gitcoin and the work done by RadicalxChange point the way towards a better future. Truly put crypto on the back-end Still, improving the governance structures behind DAOs is only a fraction of the battle. What about uncovering their greater potential to the world beyond the crypto-sphere? In order for us to even get close to that point, we need, as Jon Hillis from Cabin puts it, for “the infrastructure to be invisible.” Not everyone needs to know how to purchase a token from Uniswap. Tokens aren’t even always needed for DAOs to run. Consider Ukraine DAO. They’ve never had a token and they continue to scale membership, mostly from individuals who have little to no crypto knowledge and do not need to have said knowledge. How do they do it? They make it as easy as possible to both onboard and stay meaningfully involved, pushing the DAO’s mission forward. All DAOs could stand to learn from Ukraine DAO’s example and put crypto on the back-end as much as possible. The easier we make it for anyone to experience the future of coordination and work, the more people will realize that the future can be more distributive than extractive. Introduce credentialing where necessary Decentralized doesn’t always mean fully permissionless in every way. Yes, it could be said to be a hot take. Still, some DAOs need gated workstreams. Consider, for example, a group that wants to decentralize the research and development of medicines and other treatments. VitaDAO does this in the arena of longevity research, splitting interested individuals by their backgrounds, including only letting academics in the field of longevity science be involved in sourcing projects for prospective funding by the DAO. Boys Club requires an invite from an existing member who assures the rest of the community that you are a creative that aligns with the community’s mission. Ukraine DAO ensures that all operational decisions are made by Ukrainians. Bankless DAO relies on guilds, through which existing members vet that prospective members are cut out for the tasks involved, such as legal, writing, or project management, and more. No matter the type of DAO, some degree of credentialing is needed. For some, that means every working group. For others, that means only circles such as legal that require highly specialized skills need to be gated. Judge what to do with your particular DAO based on first, what its mission is, and second, what working groups need to exist to bring it to fruition. Start with what’s needed, pay contributors well Not everything can be bounty-based or highly free-form. Certain positions and certain DAOs need to be equivalent to salaried jobs. The individuals who hold these posts, however, should be both those who have the backgrounds that are most needed to drive the DAO forward and the drive to actually do so. Take VitaDAO, for example. Longevity researchers, scientists, and funding experts should qualify as core contributors. Others can fall along different tiers, still compensated for what they do to further the DAO’s mission. The reason why is simple. VitaDAO exists to tackle “aging with the power of a global community.” Who better to drive that effort than experts in the field? Others like Bankless DAO can be more distributed in their approach to who qualifies as core contributors, by design. Onboarding the next 1 billion people to crypto is an effort that just about anyone in the space can equally contribute to. In the end, there’s no one size fits all mold for DAO compensation but we can take pieces from our compatriots\u0027 approaches and apply them to what we do now and in the future. Moreover, we can develop better structures together. - Samudai, a DAO project management platform that enables collaboration and bounty management for admins, project managers, and contributors, is the hub for all on-chain work and collaboration, dedicated to spearheading the future of work.

    "title": "Five Tips for Managing Your Risks in DeFi",
    "detailedContent": "Decentralized finance (DeFi) offers unparalleled opportunities for investors and users alike. However, with great potential comes inherent risks. DeFi, driven by blockchain technology and smart contracts, introduces unique challenges that require careful consideration. In this article, we dive into five essential tips designed to help you effectively manage the broader risks. By understanding the intricacies of DeFi protocols, evaluating smart contract security, gauging counterparty risks, assessing market and financial vulnerabilities, and staying informed about industry developments, you can further empower yourself to navigate DeFi with confidence. 1. Understand the Protocol Before investing in or using a DeFi protocol, thoroughly understand its purpose, mechanics, and value proposition. A clear understanding of how the protocol works and what problem it aims to solve will help you assess its potential risks and rewards. Delve deep into the mechanics of the protocol. Understand how it operates, from the entry of assets to the execution of smart contracts and eventual outcomes. Comprehend the various components, interactions, and processes involved, whether it\u0027s automated market makers, yield farming, lending, borrowing, or any other functionality. 2. Assess Smart Contract Risk Smart contract risk focuses on the technical security of a platform based on its underlying code. While you don\u0027t necessarily need to be a developer, having a basic understanding of smart contract principles will allow you to gauge the protocol\u0027s complexity and assess the potential for vulnerabilities. It should go without saying that you should carefully review every smart contract transaction you make before signing. Perhaps less obvious is the need to familiarize yourself with how to read data from blockchain explorers such as Etherscan. Taking the time to actually learn to read smart contracts this way will empower you to stay safe as you interact. Investors should also consider the maturity of the smart contract deployment and its associated underlying pool contracts. Evaluate the quantity and credibility of audits conducted; remember that auditors can differ in their effectiveness based on past outcomes. Additionally, inquire into the platform\u0027s history of security breaches by checking on DeFiLlama. If any exploits have transpired, assess whether the detected vulnerabilities have been rectified, followed by a thorough audit to ensure resolution. 3. Evaluate Counterparty Risk Counterparty risk evaluation encompasses both the centralization of the platform and its governance structure, serving as a proxy for assessing counterparty risk within the DeFi ecosystem. Admin access involves the presence of admin keys, allowing protocol developers to modify smart contract parameters, posing potential financial risks. Countermeasures such as timelocks and multi-signature wallets aim to mitigate these risks. Token holders signify the number of parties controlling the protocol, influencing governance attack vulnerabilities. A larger and more diverse holder base can reduce such risks. Oracle-related risks arise from potential manipulation or malfunctions that could lead to financial losses. Decentralized oracles offer resilience against manipulation, although they might not always reflect fair market values. Network security evaluates the underlying security of platforms based on the blockchain they utilize, with Ethereum being a trusted option. Team expertise and reputation, along with project backers, are crucial indicators of a project\u0027s credibility. These elements collectively contribute to a comprehensive platform risk assessment, which aids investors in making informed decisions within the DeFi landscape. 4. Determine Market and Financial Risk Market risks are intricately interwoven with the scale of the DeFi market and the dynamic fluctuations in supply, demand, and trading volumes. These risks carry particular relevance in relation to the protocol\u0027s assets, primarily the collateral. Enhanced performance in these facets directly translates to diminished susceptibility to liquidity crises, challenges in liquidation processes, and potential scenarios resembling bank runs. The evaluation of market cap serves as a gauge of platform adoption and its influence within the market. TVL, or total value locked, showcases the cumulative value of assets staked within a specific protocol. Meanwhile, the utilization ratio provides insights into the probability of scenarios akin to bank runs, calculated by dividing total borrows by total liquidity. The quality of collateral significantly impacts the effectiveness of overcollateralization, relying on the stability and reliability of the collateral itself. Through meticulous consideration and comprehensive assessment of these factors, investors can cultivate a heightened understanding of the inherent market risks that underlie DeFi protocols. 5. Stay Informed In the swiftly evolving realm of DeFi, staying updated is pivotal. It enables you to embrace new opportunities, navigate risks, and understand market trends. The dynamic nature of DeFi introduces constant innovations, making it crucial to stay informed. Trusted news sources and active engagement in social media and community forums provide insights into the industry pulse. This practice empowers decision making, readies you for challenges, and positions you at the forefront of DeFi\u0027s groundbreaking developments.

    "title": "Blockchain Diplomas: The Disruption of Traditional Education Credentials",
    "detailedContent": "As the world becomes increasingly digital, traditional systems are being disrupted across industries, and education is no exception. One area that\u0027s ripe for transformation is the way we handle education credentials. Enter blockchain technology – a game-changer that has the potential to revolutionize how we verify and share educational achievements. Revising Traditional Credentials Traditional education credentials, such as diplomas and degrees, have long been considered the gold standard for verifying educational achievements. However, they come with their own set of challenges. The verification process is often time-consuming, involving manual checks, paperwork, and third-party interventions. This can lead to inefficiencies, errors, and delays in the recognition of an individual\u0027s educational accomplishments. Moreover, the risk of credential fraud and fake certificates remains a significant concern. Enter blockchain. The technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin offers a decentralized and immutable ledger that has the potential to address many of the shortcomings of traditional credentialing systems. Each piece of information, such as educational achievements, is stored as a \"block\" on the blockchain. These blocks are linked in a chronological and secure sequence, creating an unalterable record. This means that once educational data is recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be modified or tampered with, ensuring the integrity of the credentials. Advantages of Blockchain Diplomas The disruption of traditional education credentials by blockchain technology brings forth a range of advantages. First and foremost is the issue of verification. With blockchain diplomas, the need for time-consuming and costly manual verification processes is eliminated. Instead, individuals can provide access to their verifiable blockchain-based credentials with a simple digital signature, allowing employers and educational institutions to instantly validate the authenticity of the information. This not only saves time and resources but also enhances trust in the credentialing process. Another significant advantage is the portability and ownership of credentials. With blockchain diplomas, individuals can maintain ownership of their educational achievements throughout their lives. This empowers learners to easily share their credentials with potential employers, institutions, and other relevant parties, without the need for intermediaries. As a result, individuals have greater control over their own educational data and can present a comprehensive and verified picture of their qualifications. Enhancing Opportunities Blockchain diplomas also have the potential to open up new opportunities for lifelong learning and micro-credentials. As the job market evolves, individuals are increasingly seeking continuous upskilling and specialized training. Blockchain technology enables the creation of micro-credentials, which are smaller units of educational achievements. These can include specific courses, workshops, and projects completed. By recording these micro-credentials on the blockchain, individuals can showcase their diverse skill set and ongoing commitment to learning, making them more competitive in the job market. Challenges and Considerations While the potential of blockchain diplomas is immense, there are challenges to address. One key concern is the standardization of data formats and verification protocols across different educational institutions and platforms. Interoperability is crucial to ensure that blockchain diplomas are universally recognized and accepted. Additionally, data privacy and security are paramount. Several initiatives are already underway to implement blockchain diplomas and take on this challenge. For instance, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) issued blockchain-based digital diplomas to a select group of graduates. This move aimed to explore the potential of blockchain in increasing the security and accessibility of educational credentials. Similarly, the University of Bahrain has partnered with Learning Machine, a blockchain credentialing provider, to issue digital diplomas to its graduates. Another initiative is the Open Campus ID, a universal student ID in the form of an NFT. The idea behind Open Campus ID is to empower learners to own and carry their achievements with them across different learning platforms and, on the flip side, allow institutions and employers to access their records in a verifiable, tamper-proof manner while preserving the learner’s privacy. This is made possible through decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and zero-knowledge proofs, technologies that Open Campus plans to make a core pillar of the protocol’s technology stack. Traditional identity management systems often collect vast amounts of personal data, raising concerns about potential breaches or misuse of this information. Open Campus ID, a Web3-enabled digital identity solution, on the other hand, adopts a privacy-first approach by leveraging novel technologies such as zero-knowledge proofs. Learners also have the ability to share specific attributes or credentials without revealing their entire identity. Looking Forward As blockchain technology continues to evolve, its impact on education is becoming increasingly apparent. Blockchain diplomas have the potential to disrupt the traditional credentialing landscape by offering secure, verifiable, and portable credentials. This innovation not only streamlines the verification process but also empowers individuals to take control of their educational achievements. While challenges remain, the promise of a more efficient, transparent, and learner-centric credentialing system makes blockchain diplomas a compelling proposition for the future of education. - Will Fan is CEO and Head of School at NewCampus, a modern business school for hypergrowth leaders in Asia.

    "title": "5 Use Cases for Zero-Knowledge Proofs in Machine Learning",
    "detailedContent": "Machine learning models rely on massive amounts of data to churn out accurate outputs that seem almost magical in their ability to understand us. But, as the amount of data ingested into machine learning projects grows, privacy flaws will become increasingly apparent — and there may be a tipping point where users are no longer willing to trade their privacy for the output. Before the industry develops further, models need to have a layer of accountability built in. Users need to trust that their data won’t be abused, that the model hasn’t been altered or hacked, and that models meet rigorous data privacy standards. Right now, the standard isn’t being met — but we have the opportunity to change that. Zero-knowledge proofs are one way for developers to create and run machine learning models that prove a computation was done correctly, while being free to choose which properties to make public. The result is the best of both worlds: personalized outputs based on secure, trustworthy models. We see a growing number of real world use cases for zero-knowledge proofs that could provide safeguards as the technology reaches its full potential. Real life applications for zero-knowledge proofs Machine learning will touch every part of our lives in the future, whether we want it to or not. We’re currently in the unique position of being able to add a layer of security in several key use cases, both on-chain (public transactions carried out on a blockchain) and off-chain (transactions confirmed outside of the main blockchain network). On-chain use cases Creating privacy-preserving credit scores When crypto traders borrow, the lender needs to be sure the borrower is trustworthy. Borrowers may be operating internationally and even pseudonymously. A machine learning model can be used to assess the creditworthiness of borrowers in a way that preserves privacy, so borrowers can be matched with lenders that best meet their needs. Building private know-your-customer (KYC) processes As part of the KYC process, new users are often asked to upload a photo of their driver’s license and then perform some form of a liveness test, involving looking into their webcam and turning their head. To protect the user’s personal privacy, a machine learning model could be built leveraging zero knowledge that performs the liveness test, checks it against a user’s driver\u0027s license photo, and returns a score for how closely they match along with a proof indicating the model was run accurately. Generating accurate stablecoin exchange rates Oracles serve an essential purpose by bringing off-chain data on-chain, which is important because smart contracts can’t get to information outside of the blockchain network. They are often used in stablecoins, where the security assumptions rely on regular and timely reporting of an exchange rate between an asset (for example, ETH) and a stablecoin which is supposed to remain pegged to a real-world currency. Machine learning can help make this reporting more accurate and robust, while zero-knowledge proofs guarantee that the oracle performed the computation correctly. Off-chain use cases Safeguarding the use of machine learning in high-assurance industries When lives depend on it, it’s critical to know that machine learning models produce trustworthy results that haven’t been altered or hacked by malicious actors. Any machine learning models used in the military, AI-piloted cars, or medical imaging and diagnostics, for example, should have extra validation software that can validate a zero-knowledge proof that sensor input has been analyzed correctly. Protecting proprietary machine learning models Many companies have already built private machine-learning models that they don’t want to share publicly. Since these models may have been trained on proprietary data or used in highly regulated industries, it may become important to prove that a result came from that specific model. Conclusion As machine learning and AI enter our daily lives, it’s more important than ever for us to trust the models and data used to generate outputs that impact the safety of our world. Platforms like Aleo make developing zero-knowledge algorithms simple thanks to the private by default, programmable platform. Machine learning developers can focus on doing what they do best: creating the algorithms and models that provide new insights into our world. - Frank Chen is the Head of Product at Aleo — the leading zero-knowledge proof-based developer platform for building fully-private, scalable, and cost-effective decentralized applications — where he leads consumer product efforts. Prior to Aleo, he was at Gitcoin, where he built the first instance of a quadratic funding mechanism with Vitalik Buterin and led 10+ rounds of quadratic funding for Ethereum public goods. Frank is an avid cook, writer, jiu-jitsu competitor and coach. Aleo is the leading developer platform for building fully-private, scalable, and cost-effective decentralized applications. Using zero-knowledge cryptography, Aleo moves smart contract execution off-chain to enable new use cases like identity, finance, and gaming, scaling to thousands of transactions per second.

    "title": "These Five Pillars Will Bring Web3 Communication to the Next Billion Users",
    "detailedContent": "By Harsh Rajat, co-founder and lead of Push Protocol Communication! We can\u0027t get very far without it. From our earliest civilizations to the infrastructure that powers our most revolutionary products, communication lies at the core of how we connect to the world. Like technology itself (and in many ways because of it), how we communicate has drastically evolved, a process that hasn\u0027t been without its challenges. Through the innovation of next-generation technologies like web3, we\u0027re experiencing intuitive, new opportunities for seamlessly communicating with each other via applications that don\u0027t force us to rely on centralized web2 services such as email, social media, or text messages. Web3 has a lot of work to do to simplify access, security, and functionality within products (i.e., decentralized applications) if we\u0027re to onboard the next billion users — and keep them. Something as simple as communication is a use case and sector loaded with value and opportunity to bring more people to web3, serving as a bridge between dapps and users through the power of notifications, chat messages, and more across blockchain networks. Here are five pillars — and revolutionary features — that will bring web3 communication to the next billion users. ACCESSIBILITY: Inviting Chat Features that Mirror the Familiarity of SMS Can any of us remember a world before text messaging? SMS set the standard for how easily we can communicate across various connected devices, from phones to embedded web applications to, most recently, AI chatbots like ChatGPT. Web3-enabled communication must follow suit, mirroring the simplicity of text messaging to allow us to easily send and receive familiar chat messages across web3 environments like wallets. Speaking of wallets… PRIVACY: Wallet-to-Wallet Communication Chatting across text messages and social media DMs thrive in its simplicity and user experience but not in privacy. The centralized environments we often communicate in are not owned and controlled by us but by corporations that monitor our data and use it to sell ads. Web3 communication, where we utilize our wallet addresses to send and receive messages, offers a secure and privacy-focused alternative to traditional messaging apps. By leveraging blockchain technology, we can communicate directly via our wallet addresses without personal identifiers like phone numbers. It\u0027s the best of both worlds — web3 privacy and web2 functionality. CUSTOMIZATION: Web3-Enabled Push Notifications Have you ever asked yourself, \u0027Why am I receiving this notification — and more importantly, how do I turn it off?\u0027 While notifications can help keep us on track and in the loop, they\u0027re often at the expense of our control, privacy, and desire (another centralized tactic to monitor our digital identities). In web3 communication, however, we gain oversight and control over how we send/receive notifications and where. Through the power of features like \"delegated notifications,\" pre-approved channel owners can control who can send notifications on behalf of specific channels — and receivers on the wallet end can easily opt-out at any time (without relying on \"unsubscribe\" buttons buried within our crowded email inboxes). FLEXIBILITY: Multi-Chain Communication If we\u0027re going to onboard more users to web3, we have to give them more options of where to engage — and chat! Can you imagine if every mobile phone company had its own SMS, and if you didn\u0027t use it, you couldn\u0027t send and receive messages? Anyone who\u0027s caught flack for being the one Android user in a group chat of iPhones knows that even two SMS systems can cause friction. Web3 communication levels the playing field, allowing users across countless supported blockchains to chat easily via the same decentralized infrastructure. Say goodbye to the Battle of the Text Bubbles! DYNAMIC FORMATS: NFT, Video Chat and Audio Spaces Platforms like Discord, WhatsApp, and Zoom have revolutionized the communication space by giving us countless formats — video, text, audio, and so on. Now imagine the dynamism of chat formats without the centralized dangers (and inefficiencies) of bots, unwanted ads and notifications, and expensive tiered access. In web3 communication, any smart contract and wallet can communicate via video, text, push notifications, DAOs, groups, and NFTs. Web3 is changing how we create content, trade assets, build products, and grow communities. At the core of all of these exciting innovations is our ability to communicate; it’s essential that these conversations and connections should leverage the same unique pillars and features that enable web3 to enhance and reshape the systems of our everyday lives. If we stick to that mission, there\u0027s no telling how far these conversations — and products — can go. - Harsh Rajat is the founder and Project Lead of Push Protocol (formerly EPNS). He has over 12 years of entrepreneurial experience in various spectrum of tech; including system architecture, development and design in different tech fields (including mobile, web services, SaaS, and blockchain). Harsh previously spoke/judged at multiple tech conferences and hackathons including Messari Mainnet, ETHCC, ETHDenver, Schelling Point, ETHAmsterdam, NFT NYC, Liscon, HackMoney, EDCON. Push Protocol is a web3 communication network, enabling cross-chain notifications and messaging for dapps, wallets, and services. Push powers communication for over 100 of the world’s leading dapps and service providers across DeFi, NFTs, gaming, dev tools, and more. Push is currently live on Ethereum and Polygon. Until Push, no solution existed to enable native communication between wallets in response to on- and off-chain data. The result was a fractured dapp ecosystem, held together by antiquated and centralized communication platforms. Push is building the communication network for Web3, addressing a gap in critical infrastructure and improving the everyday experience for blockchain users.

Interoperability: Currently, loyalty points or rewards are often restricted to specific platforms, limiting their usefulness. With web3, loyalty tokens can be standardized and easily transferred between different loyalty programs, allowing users to accumulate and redeem rewards easier. In late 2022, VISA announced a partnership with ShopNEXT, a web3-specific loyalty program for Visa card holders to earn rewards on top of payment transactions which can then be used for digital shopping through a multitude of verticals. 2. Tokenization and Ownership: Web3 allows loyalty tokens to be tokenized, meaning they can exist as unique digital assets on the blockchain. This allows users to truly own and control their loyalty rewards which opens up possibilities for fractional ownership, enabling users to trade or sell their loyalty tokens on decentralized marketplaces. Tiffany \u0026 Co provided token-gated access for CryptoPunks holders, tapping into their existing strong community. In August 2022, Tiffany partnered with Crypto Punks in August 2022 allowing existing CryptoPunk owners to have their own CryptoPunk Tiffany \u0026 Co pendant for 30 ETH. 3. Gamification and engagement: Web3 can enhance user engagement by introducing gamification elements into loyalty programs. By leveraging smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps), loyalty programs can create interactive and immersive experiences, such as loyalty-based games, challenges, or competitions. In 2021, Nike launched NIKELAND, a free sports immersion in the metaverse where users can earn tokens that translate to currency for digital apparel. 4. Community Engagement and Governance: Web3 supports the creation of loyalty program communities where users can actively participate in the program\u0027s governance and decision-making processes. Users within this loyalty program can propose and vote on program changes, influencing the direction of the program and fostering a sense of community ownership. Many web3 projects have implemented decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to further the development of projects and to put the power of decision-making directly into the hands of the users and consumers. For example, Decentraland, one of the largest browser-based metaverses, uses a DAO structure as the decision-making tool for MANA, NAMES and LAND holders. The DAO controls decisions such as harmful or offensive names not allowed in Decentraland, lists of notable locations to be promoted to users in the virtual world, the list of community run servers that host the world and more. 5. Programmable and Automated Rewards: With web3, loyalty programs can leverage smart contracts to automate reward distribution based on predefined conditions and rules. For example, loyalty tokens can be automatically issued when a user completes a specific action or reaches a predetermined milestone. This programmability reduces administrative overhead and ensures timely and accurate reward distribution. Starbucks launched Starbucks Odyssey in September 2022 providing the opportunity for users to earn and purchase digital collectible assets that will unlock access to new benefits and immersive coffee experiences including special events and immersive Starbucks Reserve stores. The future of web3 loyalty programs will be shaped by ongoing developments in web3 technologies, regulatory considerations, and market dynamics. As adoption and understanding of web3 grow, companies have the opportunity to reimagine loyalty programs, opening up more value to customers and fostering stronger brand loyalty. - Craig DeWitt, is the co-founder and Head of Product for Supermojo, an NFT payment solution.

    "title": "ERC-4337: Driving Web3 Adoption for Wallet, NFTs, Decentralized Social and Beyond",
    "detailedContent": "The first wave of NFTs in the summer of 2021 (commonly known as “NFT summer”) can be classified as rigid in function, expensive (both in price tag and due to their skyrocketing gas fees), confusing to obtain, weak in security, and limited in their blockchain of origin — which for the majority of mints were Ethereum. But after billions of dollars of headline-grabbing sales, viral on-chain communities, congested chains, cost-intensive transactions, lost assets, and relatively limited use cases, change is finally in the air — and not just on one blockchain (Ethereum) or through its traditional token standard (ERC-721). Over the last year and more, our market has watched more blockchains and novel token standards grow to support the next wave of blockchain-powered use cases. Dynamic utility, lower costs, and innovative opportunities for security, access, and adoption have demonstrated promise and possibilities for longevity and adoption over hype. From BNB Chain to Solana and Polygon, SBTs (soulbound tokens) to the token standard covered in this piece — Ethereum’s latest upgrade, the ERC-4337 — the future of NFTs and wallets we store are looking increasingly innovative for developers, users, and web3 overall. ERC-4337: What it is and why it’s needed ERC-4337 stands for “Ethereum Request for Comment 4337.” This moniker has nothing to do with public relations, but a smart contract standard for account abstraction, which enables individual Ethereum wallets to act as a customizable smart contract. This novel concept brings to life various user and developer-focused innovations that help abstract away some of the complexities of crypto wallets, like switching networks, cryptographic signatures, and private key management. Through the power of account abstraction, we can empower users with powerful new features that help bypass certain key challenges in web3 that have contributed to the bottleneck in increasing mass adoption of decentralized applications. Below, let’s see what some of these features are and what value they bring. Social Recovery: Think of this like two-factor authorization (2FA) that’s become commonplace as a security standard across most social media, email, and web2 applications. In this case, if you lose your private keys, which grant you access to a web3 wallet like Metamask, you can recover access to your assets through 2FA connected to your phone, email or even biometrics without needing seed phrases. Signature Abstraction: Think of this like a mobile banking app. You can set automated limits on daily transfers, trades, or budgets for certain categories of transactions. By allowing users customization options to define their wallet’s authorization schemes, we can open up an entire range of possibilities. Example: the user can set rules to reject transfers over $500 USDC or require multi-party signatures for transactions above $50 USDC. Session Keys: Consider it like ‘Remember Me’ when signing onto your favorite web2 social application. By utilizing account abstraction, we can enable session keys that remember your wallet without the need to sign every little action on a web3 dApp. Batch Transactions: By batching transactions together, users can execute trades more efficiently and inexpensively. If you’ve ever swapped a token on Uniswap, you know how you have to sign the transaction multiple times (at least twice) to approve and execute that transaction. With account abstraction, we can batch those together, consume less gas and make the user experience less clunky and intimidating. Gas Delegation: This is crucial for the growth of web3 dApps, where congested blockchain often leads to high hefty price tags for users. This is especially apparent in NFTs, where in 2022, an anonymous Bored Ape buyer spent $45,000 in gas fees. By delegating the gas fees to others, or alternatively, an application taking over the responsibility for paying their users’ gas, we can fuel mass adoption in web3 by empowering more people to engage. No user wants to pay for a gas fee every time they perform an action on a dApp. By passing on that cost to the underlying platform, we enable alternate, novel business models that don’t rely on users transacting as much as humanly possible. Multi-Party Computation: Think of this one as ‘sign in with Google,’ but for web3 wallets. Instead of authorizing another application to log into an account for you, it allows you to enable (and require) multiple key signers, each holding their private data to trigger an action (like signing in with a private key) without revealing that action to the other parties. The potential of ERC-4337 in the future of web3 By offering developers and their applications the flexible, approachable, and intuitive features, ERC-4337 shows tremendous potential across multiple use cases, not just in NFTs, but any web3 sector that relies on tokenized assets and on-chain transactions (which is most!). From ease of access to lower transaction costs, approachable security features, and speed, ERC-4337 can help bring more users to growing corners of the blockchain sector like decentralized social apps, where tokenized content and on-chain identity feature warrant more accessibility for communities to engage, leverage wallets, and build audiences. Like any piece of technology that’s made it easier for humans to create and connect, ERC-4337 shows serious potential in ushering a new era of innovation and adoption. - Ryan Li is the Co-Founder of CyberConnect, web3’s earliest and biggest decentralized social network, focusing on building and scaling the next generation of decentralized social media platforms.

    "detailedContent": "By Antoni Zolciak and Matthew Niemerg Privacy can exist on a spectrum. When it comes to this hot topic, it’s easy to think in absolute terms. But the unfortunate truth is that this is rarely a binary, even in real life. This conversation is increasingly important as different jurisdictions start to regulate the roles of individuals, businesses, and governments in the context of technology and privacy. We shouldn’t expect web3 to escape their impact. Moreover, we should understand that web3 has the potential to define the conversation going forward. This is why the conversations around controversies surrounding Arkham Intelligence and web3 privacy are especially important.

Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox, along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right, millions love us!) — what are you waiting for? Privacy, technology, and policy We’re always being selective about our privacy in everyday interactions. We choose to share identity, financial information, or personal interests to everyone ranging from close relatives to online strangers to large corporations to the government. These disclosures happen because that personal information is necessary to the other party and we expect to receive a service or good in return. For example, a company might need your financial information to process a payment or your identity in order to comply with KYC or AML. At the end of the day, individual and enterprise users alike have a right to customize their own privacy settings depending on the context. We should think about online privacy in the same way. True privacy means that everyone fully owns their information and can be selective about how to share it. In a functioning society, this will sometimes mean making disclosures to satisfy business terms or legal requirements. The goal is to make users aware of what, how, why, and who they share their sensitive details with and give them proper tools to manage the process. Revealing secrets selectively There’s a reason, however, why we’ve become used to talking about privacy in the wrong way. The internet’s current server-based architecture lets a handful of centralized entities collect and manage the information of billions of users. As a result, people think about privacy as a “take it or leave it” deal in exchange for convenience. But now we’re at a place where we can digitally emulate real life when it comes to privacy. Web3’s infrastructure puts users back in a position where they can access company services while their information stays with them and not in a remote server. Zero-knowledge proofs even lets them prove claims without revealing any information at all. Whose choice is it? All of this leaves us with the question of who gets to choose what. There’s a balance to strike in terms of how information is shared between individuals, businesses, and government institutions. Individual prerogative The decision to reveal personal information should always remain in the hands of individuals. However, government institutions will still choose when and how to enforce their own terms. This leaves individuals in a position where they’re incentivized to provide information on their own in return for a service, benefit, or protection. A perfect example of how this exists with the European GDPR regulations. Here, individuals always have the option to opt-out of any data exchange before every interaction. This lets them retain their agency. At the same time, it provides businesses the guidelines to operate effectively and within defined boundaries. Business models Just as individuals can define their own privacy decisions, businesses also have a right to enforce their own policy requirements. It wouldn’t be disagreeable for businesses that rely on ad revenue to require certain disclosures in exchange for better services. Both ends of the market can decide what to accept and reject, without a centralized middle man. But we’re seeing recent legislation that could tilt the balance too far in the opposite direction of GDPR. Florida’s “Digital Bill of Rights” (SB262) will require digital services to disclose important competitive information about their business models and comply with individual privacy requests that are operationally unfeasible. Government protection This leads us to the role of governments. It would be naive to expect that governments won\u0027t maintain some degree of enforceability over critical information, especially in matters of national security. Everyday concerns matter, too. The INFORM Consumers Act offers clear protections for buyers against the epidemic of counterfeit goods that exists in online marketplaces. The new regulation rightfully requires platforms to verify vendors\u0027 identities to ensure consumer protection against fraud. The right understanding This is not to say that heavy-handed actions enforced by government institutions are justified. A lot of the fear mongering around web3 privacy is due to a fundamental misunderstanding by regulators on how anonymous transfers actually work. In most of the privacy-preserving protocols in web3 there exists a cryptographic way for a user to reveal the origin of the transaction through approaches such as view keys. This gives users the ability to remove anonymity at their discretion. “Their discretion” being key here. Web3 simply makes privacy more negotiable than ever. Still, there are certainly new lines to be drawn. But they should be in line with the right understanding of web3 technology. In terms of regulatory approach, the outlook on how to regulate the roles of individuals, businesses, and governments should be one of guaranteeing this “negotiability” of privacy. Intelligence exchanges and where privacy matters We should examine new developments around privacy in web3 and Arkham Intelligence’s dox-to-earn business model under this light. We live in a world where everything and anything can be monetized and sometimes the pursuit of profit fails to consider the longer-term detrimental effects on a free society. This disregard for consequences can jeopardize the safety and well-being of individuals and groups. Moreover, the consequences extend beyond personal finances. There is a genuine risk of exposing wallet addresses, as well as the personal information of family members such as children, parents, siblings, spouses, and friends. An Intelligence Exchange aims to undermine the financial privacy of individuals within the web3 space. By doing so, it fosters a culture that undermines the significance of financial privacy and privacy in general. This business model takes away the individual prerogative to privacy and leaves it at the mercy of online mobs. Such reckless exposure has the potential to place individuals in harm’s way, calling for the role of governments to ensure their safety. If web3 returns privacy to its rightful place as an individual prerogative and makes it negotiable, a service like Arkham should be the right focus for regulatory discussions. - The Aleph Zero blockchain was founded in 2018 to enable a fast, secure, scalable, and privacy-preserving environment for Web3 builders.

    "title": "From Classroom to Blockchain: How Crypto Fuels Education Companies",
    "detailedContent": "The world of education is evolving rapidly, and with it comes the pressing need for innovative financing solutions. With the number of venture capital deals dropping 50% year-over-year, conventional funding avenues often fall short in meeting the diverse needs of education companies seeking to scale their operations and expand their impact. With the recent announcement of the US$10M Web3 Global Educators Fund by Open Campus, this draws attention in leveraging alternative financing asset classes, such as cryptocurrency, to drive the growth and transformation of education companies. The Advantages of Crypto for Education Financing One of the key highlights is the decentralized nature of blockchain, which breaks down the barriers that traditional funding sources often impose. With crypto, education companies gain access to a global pool of investors and backers, liberating them from the constraints of geographical boundaries and rigid regulations. With the gaming industry paving the way, this open and borderless approach democratizes capital, allowing more players to participate and invest in the future of education. The transparency and security that crypto offers are equally compelling. Blockchain technology ensures that financial transactions are recorded immutably, creating a trust-driven environment where accountability takes center stage. In an industry where trust is vital, the immutable nature of blockchain instills confidence among stakeholders, from investors to learners. As we venture into this exciting era of education financing, embracing the power of crypto will unlock a wealth of opportunities for growth and innovation. Tokenization and Incentives By harnessing the power of blockchain networks, education companies can revolutionize how they reward and motivate learners and educators. Through the creation of unique tokens, students are empowered with a sense of ownership and recognition for their achievements, fueling their drive to actively participate in their educational journey. Gamification of learning isn’t new. This culture of continuous learning not only boosts learner retention but also fosters a thriving educational community that celebrates growth. With crypto-driven incentives, education companies can go beyond traditional reward structures, offering learners tangible and transferable assets. These tokens hold real value within the ecosystem, opening up new avenues for learners to unlock additional educational resources or even trade tokens with others. Such gamification of education not only deepens learner engagement but also encourages collaboration and knowledge-sharing among peers. As we embrace this exciting era of crypto-powered education, the potential for innovation and learner empowerment is boundless. Collaborative Learning and Content Creation With blockchain technology, education companies can foster a culture of collaborative learning and content creation like never before. By harnessing the decentralized nature of blockchain, institutions, educators and learners can seamlessly come together, exchanging ideas, sharing resources, and co-creating educational materials. This collaborative approach breaks down the barriers of traditional silos, encouraging a diverse range of perspectives and expertise to shape the educational landscape. Blockchain\u0027s transparent and immutable nature also ensures the authenticity and credibility of educational content. By leveraging blockchain for content creation, education companies can provide learners with verified and trustworthy resources, enhancing the overall quality of education. The power of collaboration and content creation on the blockchain not only revolutionizes the learning experience but also cultivates a sense of community and shared purpose among learners and educators. Addressing Challenges and Mitigating Risks When venturing into the world of crypto financing, education companies need to be mindful of the challenges and risks that come with this disruptive technology. Regulatory uncertainties and market volatility can create uncertainty, but proactive planning and staying informed on evolving regulations can help navigate these hurdles. Implementing strong security measures is also paramount to safeguarding the financial interests of learners and stakeholders. It\u0027s essential for education companies to approach crypto financing with a balanced mindset, embracing the benefits while taking prudent steps to address potential risks. With a commitment to compliance and a focus on building trust among investors and learners, education companies can establish a solid foundation for sustainable innovation. Looking Forward The education sector stands on the precipice of transformation, and crypto presents a remarkable opportunity for financing growth. By embracing the principles of decentralization, tokenization, and collaboration, education companies can unleash their true potential and make a lasting impact on learners worldwide. The path ahead may be novel and challenging, but it\u0027s one that daring education entrepreneurs must explore to unlock the full potential of their vision. - Will Fan is CEO and Head of School at NewCampus, a modern business school for hypergrowth leaders in Asia.

    "title": "Web3 Is Getting a Larger Hard Drive, Now It Needs a Faster Processor",
    "detailedContent": "By Felipe Argento and Brandon J. Isaacson The blockchain technology stack is tasked with serving several crucial functions. Until relatively recently, these were all performed by individual L1 blockchains like Ethereum. This setup, known as a monolithic blockchain, doesn’t scale very well. Scaling solutions like rollups are a good way to offload some responsibility from L1s while maintaining roughly the same security guarantees. One type of rollup that is gaining in popularity – application-specific rollups – is poised to scale computation and drive a new wave of innovation in Web3. The scalability issue at a glance To understand why monolithic blockchains struggle to scale, we need to get a bit into the weeds. When one chain is handling every function — consensus, data availability, and execution — a single set of nodes is called upon to verify each and every action, by every DApp and user in the network. This can overload the system very quickly. As usage increases, DApps and users start competing for the chain’s finite blockspace, which becomes an unmanageably scarce resource. The result is that DApps and users who can’t win blockspace bidding wars are excluded from participating. This monolithic setup eventually degenerates into high fees and poses an ever-growing entry barrier for projects and users alike. For example, right now, a single popular NFT mint or highly anticipated airdrop can still render the Ethereum network unusable for nearly everyone else. The “shared” rollup approach To address some of these scaling issues, Ethereum pivoted in late 2020 to a rollup-centric roadmap. Rollups are a way of delegating important functions to systems running outside of the base chain. They then consolidate the results and add them to the underlying blockchain using cryptography techniques like fraud proofs and validity proofs. The rollup-centric path was rooted in the idea that scalability constraints on Ethereum can be broken down into two discrete issues: data scalability and computational scalability. What this means, in simple terms, is that a blockchain’s usage can be limited by two fundamental problems: how much data it can store and how many tasks it can process. If we think of Ethereum as one large, shared computer, Ethereum shifted its focus to scaling how much data its blocks can hold (let’s view this as “upgrading its hard drive”), while delegating computational scalability (“upgrading its processor”) to rollups projects. The first major wave of rollups adoption began in 2021. The launch of Layer 2 (L2) projects like Arbitrum and Optimism was based on “shared” rollups architectures. The rollups from these projects are “shared” in the sense that each DApp on the protocol shares space inside a single rollup with other DApps deployed on the same L2. DApps deployed on shared rollups theoretically enjoy gains in computing power as long as the L2 is less congested than the underlying L1. But there’s a catch. With each DApp sharing space inside the same rollup, there’s still competition amongst DApps for the processing power of L2 validators. Just as is the case with monolithic blockchains, periods of heavy usage on shared rollups can cause L2 fees to spike to unpredictable levels. Ultimately, once a shared rollup gains enough popularity, it’s vulnerable to the same exact congestion and cost dynamics posed by a monolithic design. The “shared” rollup approach brings us back to square one — albeit with some buffer time. The arrival of appchains In search of maximum scalability, customizability, and fee predictability, projects, including Cartesi, are starting to move beyond shared rollup architectures. They’re finding that building on application-specific rollups (commonly referred to as appchains) can bring better results for computational scalability. Similar to shared rollups, application-specific rollups act as off-chain execution layers that inherit security and censorship guarantees from the Ethereum base layer. But now, instead of sharing space inside a single rollup, each DApp has its own dedicated rollup to process off-chain tasks. This setup not only solves the issue of bidding wars amongst applications, but also provides significant gains in computational scalability. With only one application per rollup, each DApp can now benefit from full, unshared computing power. Rather than competing in a zero-sum game for validator computing power, each DApp can have its own high-performing rollup chain. These gains in computing power open the design space for developers in a very meaningful way. DApps deployed on application-specific rollups can now begin to more closely mimic traditional software applications in terms of programmability, cost efficiency, fee predictability, and user experience. Moving forward: the cone of innovation Ethereum’s rollup-centric vision calls for a collective effort. For its part, Ethereum has several initiatives on its roadmap that are poised to scale data availability like EIP4844 and sharding. But for Web3 to reach its full innovative potential, rollups projects must continue to push the boundaries of decentralized computation. The figure below helps us visualize how scaling data and computation together can pave the way for previously impossible decentralized applications: Web3’s Cone of Innovation created by Cartesi core contributors On the x-axis, we see that data availability improves with the implementation of EIP4844 and sharding. On the y-axis, computational capacity scales as we move from a monolithic L1 blockchain, to shared rollups, to application-specific rollups. The blue area on the graph is what we can call Web3’s Cone of Innovation. As scaling progresses in both dimensions, more complex DApps become possible. By contrast, the gray areas outside the cone show what happens when data availability and computation don’t scale in tandem. (The applications and their positioning inside the cone aren’t intended to be taken as gospel. Rather, the figure is meant to provide an intuitive outlook on the growing horizon of decentralized applications.) The main takeaway is that gains in data availability can’t be fully utilized without concurrent gains in computational capacity, and vice-versa. Both need to grow together. Application-specific rollups are a prime solution for growing the Ethereum network’s processing power. - Felipe Argento is an advisor at the Cartesi Foundation, focusing on Layer 2 research and application.

    "title": "5 Ways Projects Can Strengthen Their Communities During a Bear Market",
    "detailedContent": "Crypto is no stranger to bear markets; the last few years have seen significant drawdown in valuations in this relatively new industry. Experienced web3 builders expect and sometimes even welcome bear markets, as they have the ability to “trim the fat” of the ecosystem and return attention from hyped use cases to core fundamentals. For many communities, however, bear markets are tough periods of disillusionment and slowed growth. It’s easy to give into this disillusion, but it’s also vital to recognize just how powerful a tokenized community can be in these periods in terms of support, knowledge-sharing and positivity. Here are five strategies to help communities thrive, especially during a bear market. 1. Roll Out a Content Calendar. Communities respond to consistency. Following the energy of a bull market, the crash can feel severe and discouraging to community members. A consistent content calendar provides the community with regular events, meetings and discussions to look forward to. This calendar should be carefully planned to provide a good balance of education, announcements, entertainment and community-building activities to attract various personas of community members. Depending on your project, these events can include developer office hours, safety and security talks, community feedback sessions, AMAs, sessions with external experts, and trending web3 topics. 2. Involve Members. People join communities for a variety of reasons, but they typically stay in them because they’ve found connection and alignment. During a bear market, it’s more important than ever to create experiences for members to mix and mingle. Whether it’s learning opportunities, multi-player games or open forums, testing out a variety of ways for individuals to build connections can help strengthen your community. Consider quizzes, contests and games that are managed within Discord and provide members with rewards (like POAPs) and points based on participation and success. 3. Grow Community-Born Leaders. There are some better strategies for growing strong communities like identifying, training and growing leaders from within. Community-born leaders have a special sense of insight into the community, and often hold a unique reputation among the rest of the members. Additionally, by involving members in leadership, the project gains valuable insight into what the community needs and wants. Bear markets are especially strong times to elevate these leaders, because you know who has stuck around through thick and thin. 4. Help Build Reputation. Bear markets are opportunities to identify your most loyal community members and provide them with additional value. There are many ways to do this, including tipping, NFT badges, Discord roles and verifiable credentials. These acknowledgements create a positive environment where community members know that their contributions are appreciated, and most importantly shareable. This type of relationship between community members and protocol is core to web3, and allows those individuals to ‘take’ their reputation with them. 5. Maintain a Positive Environment. It’s common to feel down in the bear market, but communities can be the wellsprings of positivity. Light-hearted activities and a collaborative communication style can go a long way in enhancing morale. Enjoyable events like meetups, game nights, and meme contests give your community a way to decompress and enjoy each others’ company and spread good vibes. Your goals during a bear market won’t look exactly like your goals during a bull market. Bear market goals should focus on keeping your community engaged and informed, being a beacon for support and relationships. Remember that a strong community can weather the storm, while preparing for the next bull market. - Collab.Land is a full-service automated member management system for tokenized communities.

    "title": "CoinMarketCap #REBUIDL — What Does The Future Hold And How Can We Move Forward?",
    "detailedContent": "For the last ten days or so, one topic has ruled them all in the crypto space: How the \u0026§%@ did FTX collapse and where do we go from here? CoinMarketCap Academy covered the bank run on FTX in great detail: In the Glassnode on-chain report The Fall of FTX. In our deep dive explainer of the FTX collapse. In our weekly Twitter round-up titled \"Bankrupt Altruism\". That answers the first part of the question. So, where do we go from here? That was covered on yesterday\u0027s CoinMarketCap Twitter Space #REBUIDL Crypto. CoinMarketCap’s mission has always been to provide fair data and education to the masses. With the recent FTX crisis affecting many, confidence in the industry has taken a hit. To help rebuild crypto together and support the community going through hard times, CoinMarketCap has gathered some of the industry-leading voices to discuss the path forward. If you missed it, we have a TLDR of the most important talking points from this illustrious line-up of guests: • Eowyn, CEO of TrustWallet • Dyma, CEO of Hacken • Pete Rizzo, Editor of Bitcoin Magazine • Austin Adams, Researcher at Uniswap • Andrew T, Content Lead at Nansen • Sam, Director of Community and Ecosystem at Circle • Vijay from Uniswap • Laura Shin, crypto journalist • Ritvik Carvalho from Binance • Adrian from BUSD On lessons from the previous bear market Most guests were around for the previous bear market, so everyone knows the drill. Eowyn pointed out that a bear market is the best time to see what remains and has value. It\u0027s also the best time to build new features and capabilities (something that TrustWallet plans to do). On the importance of self-custody Self-custody has been a major talking point since the FTX fiasco. Particularly, bitcoiners have been steadfastly reminding everyone of the importance of self-custody — can\u0027t get liquidated from a cold wallet after all! Pete reinforced that point: self-custody is the number one lesson and the reason why crypto exists in the first place. Still, the consensus was that custodians aren\u0027t going anywhere. Eowyn pointed out that centralized exchanges are here to stay since they provide the most liquidity. But even centralized exchanges have something to gain here. They can leverage on-chain verification of assets for audits (and, by extension, build trust with users), as Dyma from Hacken reminded listeners. On moving on from FTX by building The mood on Crypto Twitter ever since the bankruptcy has been defiant. This \u0027we ain\u0027t leaving\u0027 attitude is backed up by a focus on building, another big talking point of the Space. Two major points emerged as consensus: Building more on-chain audits and self-regulation. Bitcoiners have a natural tendency for skepticism, as Pete explained, so \"promoting a culture of scrutiny\" will do the space a lot of good. Andrew from Nansen agreed that more self-correction in the industry is necessary because regulators won\u0027t do a better job. Besides on-chain audits for CEXes, the robustness of DeFi proved itself to be a useful asset for the future. As Andrew rightly explained, DeFi overcollateralization and automatic liquidations have their strengths. Meanwhile, Austin Adams pointed out that with Uniswap, you don’t need to put your trust in people, but instead “you just have to put your trust in the code and that it works.” As an OG of the space, Pete remembered the sentiment after the Mt Gox collapse, which was very similar to what is happening today: winter is here, so time to dig in and build. On the crypto media coverage of FTX Another interesting topic was the crypto media coverage of the FTX collapse. Crypto journalist Laura Shin praised Coindesk for setting everything in motion by having the guts to break the story in the first place. Still, she rightly said that no one was interested in providing sources on SBF\u0027s flaws when things were going as planned — a reminder how difficult self-regulation of the industry can be. On lessons for the future Two points stood out in this last section: • Data literacy and \u0027on-chain fluency\u0027 is growing (also thanks to FTX). • This will help steer the industry back to its roots. Adrian from BUSD made a great point: Google has \"don\u0027t be evil\" so crypto can have \"can\u0027t be evil\" thanks to on-chain transparency. After all, it\u0027s all about who is trying to grow the industry and do good versus who\u0027s just in it for the money. Finally, Dyma also said that CoinMarketCap has “all the cards to bring trust and transparency back to our industry.” We are definitely working with that goal in mind! A story to keep in mind Even if you skip the two-hour long Space, the last six minutes are worth tuning into. @whatajkay tells his story of how he went from zero to hero (millions) on FTX and back to zero (thanks SBF!) and how to overcome \u0027getting rugged by life.\u0027 His takeaway: Life comes faster than you think, so focus on the future no matter what s**t happened to you yesterday.

At this point in our investigation, we’ve come to the conclusion that the leak did not come from CoinMarketCap servers. As no passwords are included in the data we have seen, we believe that it is most likely sourced from another platform where users may have reused passwords across multiple sites. We believe that a bad actor (or actors) took a list of leaked emails (this list that claims to be from CoinMarketCap) and compared it with other batches of leaked data. This is how the list of emails that claims to be from CoinMarketCap looks real — it’s because it’s a “cleaned” email dataset from the Dark Web that has occurred in previous leaked email sets totally unrelated to CoinMarketCap. We can state with confidence that the leaks did not come from CoinMarketCap servers. We ran a comprehensive security check and there is no trace of any security breach of our servers. We urge everyone to adopt good cybersecurity habits, and to have unique passwords on every site they use.",

    "title": "The Money Making Machine Behind the Polygon Spam Attacks",
    "detailedContent": "Since May, there’s been a lot of talk about Polygon “flipping” Ethereum — at first in terms of transaction count (at its peak, there were 8M transactions per day happening on Polygon, compared to 1.2M TPD on Ethereum) and just last week in terms of active user count — rising to a record high of 566,516 active addresses on Saturday, surpassing Ethereum for the first time. However, it’s also been reported in a Polygon forum that the network has been under a spam attack since May, which has been inflating network utilization numbers by 90%. Every block was full of users sending meaningless transactions and just paying for the gas fees. With 1 gwei in gas price, or 0.000000001 MATIC / gas, and a 20 million gas limit per block, it only costs around 0.02 MATIC to spam an entire block on Polygon, or $1,000 for an entire day. So it’s cheap to flood a whole block — but still, what’s the incentive? This article sheds light on the mechanism happening behind these spam transactions, and the profits at stake. Our research suggests that increasing gas fees to 30 gwei could be very effective in this case. Access Polygon data here The Arbitrage Bot Behind these Spam Attacks Identifying the Sender On average, the top 10 DApps in terms of weekly transaction count add up to 3 million transactions per week, or 420k transactions per day. With 4M-6M transactions happening on the whole network daily, the top 10 applications account for less than 10% of the total network - so where are the rest of the transactions coming from? With a simple query we were able to find the top 10 addresses in terms of total transactions. The top two contracts, “0xa81ce04168e41a47f68a975d67a00fbef729af9b” and “0x84e5bc3df0df0f543648f250443c6f4077218312,” have been interacting with 2 million transactions daily — which accounts for roughly 30% of the network’s total transaction count. Source: Polygon dashboard Looking at the details of their transactions, we can see that these two contracts are arbitrage bots. They are the target of millions of transactions every day, and initiate thousands of daily transactions to DEXes themselves. Identifying the Recipient Source: Transaction For example, in the above trade, this contract sent out 0.153 MATIC worth 0.23$ and receive back 4.33 MATIC worth 6.5$ An arbitrage bot is a bot that captures the different exchange rates between platforms to make profit. For example, if Uniswap has 3700$ / ETH and Sushi has 3600$ / ETH, you can simultaneously buy on Sushi and sell on Uniswap to capture the 100$ difference. We now have the full picture: spam attack transactions act as the trigger for these arbitrage bots to make their own transactions on DEXes. By plotting the total transactions sent out by these bot contracts, we can see that they make around 2,000 – 4,000 transactions per day, which is nothing unusual. Source: Polygon dashboard We don’t know the contract’s code so we cannot explain why it needs so many input transactions versus just 2,000–4,000 trades per day. The likely theory is that the owner just wants to spam the contract so others cannot front-run the real trade. So someone has a bot that floods a block with noise to protect from front running, as opposed to using priority fees to ensure they are always first in the block. But is it really cheaper to buy a whole block than to just pay exorbitant prices to be first? How much is this spammer making? By tracking the contract creator we can see that the bot was initially funded with 14 ETH (~$3,775) and made multiple transactions back for a total of 218.5 ETH (equivalent to ~$825,000 at the time of writing) that was bridged back to Ethereum. That’s an average of $6,800 a day in profits over the past 120 days — which is how long the bot has been running. Increasing Transaction Fees On Oct. 5, 2021, the network’s co-founder recommended increasing the minimum transaction fee from 1 gwei to 30 gwei - raising the cost of spamming an entire day to $30,000 to disincentivize spam transactions from happening. Shortly after the adjustment, the spam transactions dropped 75% from 2M to just 500k TPD. Polygon’s daily transactions also dropped 50% from 6M to just over 3M TPD. This is clearly shown in the graph above. As shown in the graph above, the network’s utilization rate also dropped down from 90% back to 60% which is a healthier rate. This leaves a lot of room for others to build on Polygon. It’s worth noting that even with the 75% drop, spam transactions still account for 16.7% of the network’s daily transactions. This means bots are still spending around $5,000 a day at the current gas price, or 83% of their daily profit, to keep this operation going.

    "title": "The Shadow of \"Stagflation\" Spreads Many Countries, Investment Institutions Increase Crypto Investments: Weekly Market Review From TokenInsight",
    "detailedContent": "The performance of the crypto market has reached a new high since June. The main reasons are the persistence of high inflation expectations in many countries, the strengthening of \"stagflation\" risks, and the SEC\u0027s notice of no objection to Bitcoin futures ETFs. Bitcoin futures ETFs have been notified by the SEC of no objection, which means that the world\u0027s largest capital market is officially open to cryptos, and the biggest regulatory risks have been eliminated in the short term, clearing the way for mainstream institutions to enter the market. Under the influence of the temporary increase of the US debt ceiling, the high market risk appetite, and the endorsement of institutions entering the market, US debt and US dollar both fell. Although many central banks have released the news of bringing forward interest rate hikes, the high inflation pressure shows that the overall liquidity of the market is expected to remain at a high level for a long time. The Bull Market Is Still Continuing After a short trough, the crypto market entered an explosive phase this week. In terms of market value, as of 4:00 UTC on Oct. 15, the market value of the whole market has risen to $2.45T and is about to approach an all-time high ($2.54T). From the perspective of volatility, the market volatility difference continued to expand this week, while the implied volatility was higher than the realized volatility, indicating that the market is stable in the bull market stage, and there is no sign of decline. From the perspective of skewness, market expectations have risen in the short term, but the medium and long-term expectations have not changed much compared with last week. An important reason is that a large number of professional investors have turned to bulls since the beginning of August. From the perspective of the futures term structure, on the one hand, the bullish sentiment in the derivatives market is obvious, and the overall premium of futures has risen to a new high since May. On the other hand, the premium of forwarding futures term structure on major futures exchanges has obviously declined, indicating that although investors are optimistic, they are not going to pay more premium for the future due to worries about the risk of monetary policy tightening and macro liquidity contraction. Anti-Inflationary Demand: the Source of the Bull Market The outstanding performance of the crypto market this week is inseparable from changes in the macro-environment. On Oct. 13, the September CPI in the United States was announced, in which the inflation rate was reported to be 5.4%, higher than market expectations, and much higher than the 2% target set by the Federal Reserve. In contrast, the non-agricultural index, which reflects the economic growth situation, hit a new low. Considering that high inflation of more than 5% has lasted for half a year, investors have insufficient confidence in the Fed to reduce inflation. Economic growth is still lower than expected, indicating that the stimulus to the economy by releasing liquidity has not had enough effect. Affected by this, institutional investors are turning to stocks, commodities, and cryptos to hedge inflation risks. In addition, a number of macro indicators show that the risk of \"stagflation\" is increasing. Under the pressure of flooded liquidity, developed country economies such as South Korea and New Zealand have responded by raising interest rates, while the UK has also indicated that it may raise interest rates earlier than December. The divergence between the US Institute for Supply Management\u0027s (ISM) manufacturing production index and the price index, and the US 10-year Treasury yield exceeded 1.61% on October 11 despite the increase in real yields, may confirm the threat of stagflation. OPEC\u0027s slow and steady production growth may pose a serious inflation threat and have a counterproductive impact on oil demand. The Federal Reserve is facing concerns about inflation risks and stagnant economic growth, but the Fed\u0027s tough attitude on interest rates and expectations of earlier debt reduction (at a time when prices are soaring and output is stagnant) point to stagflation. Under such circumstances, the demand for inflation-resistant assets such as Bitcoin has further increased. At the same time, the SEC\u0027s approval of Bitcoin futures ETFs and the liberalization of crypto transactions in Russia, India, and other countries indicate that crypto investment is officially accepted by major capital markets under the background of gradual improvement of compliance. On this basis, some highly regulated institutional investors (such as pension funds) have also begun to consider participating in crypto-related transactions. It can be predicted that due to the persistence of a high inflation environment, with institutions from major capital markets extensively participating in crypto market-related businesses, the possibility that the good performance of the crypto market will continue to increase significantly until the end of the year. However, although the liquidity risk will not significantly affect the market in the short term, in the medium and long term, due to the general toughness of central banks in monetary policies, the risk of liquidity contraction is still one of the important threats to the future performance of the crypto market.",

    "title": "Lido Deep Dive: Everything You Need To Know by Flipside Crypto",
    "detailedContent": "By now, you’ve probably heard of Lido, known as the “liquid staking solution for Ethereum.” Since debuting earlier this year, users have diligently aped into the protocol, depositing more than $6.10 billion to it. A reenactment of users rushing into Lido this year The team behind Lido has also been hard at work expanding the protocol. They’ve already debuted new staking options to the platform in recent months in the form of LUNA and SOL in search of even more users. Lido developers expanding the protocol But what is liquid staking? 🤔 💧 🧐 And how does it let users double-dip yields? 🤯 💰💰 What’s the deal with stETH, bLUNA, stSOL, and LDO? 🪙 🪙 🪙 And why is everyone so damn excited about Lido? 🎉 🥳 📈 Let’s find out together. Lido \u003d Liquid Staking Lido describes itself as “an Ethereum-based liquid staking solution supported by leading blockchain staking providers.” It allows users to receive rewards for staking ETH, LUNA, or SOL. How does that relate to double-dipped yields? Well, Lido seeks to solve one of the major downsides to staking —namely the illiquidity, immovability, and inaccessibility of funds usually dedicated to staking. To do so, the protocol essentially enables users to double-dip on their tokens. Users can earn rewards in the form of stETH, bLUNA, and stSOL, while still allowing these tokens to be deployed across the DeFi ecosystem. Lido.fi Users can stake their tokens individually by running their own validator node or by delegating to a validator based on the size of their deposit. Rewards are distributed on a 1:1 basis representing their staked currency — ETH deposits are rewarded with stETH, LUNA deposits with bLUNA, and SOL deposits with stSOL. Each token can then be used to earn extra yield — aka be double dipped. That means more return on investment, so make sure your bags are ready. Double-yields \u003d more ROI What are stETH, bLUNA, stSOL, and LDO? StETH is a token that represents staked ETH in Lido, while bLUNA represents staked LUNA, and stSOL represents staked SOL. They are pegged 1:1 to the corresponding currency staked to the protocol, and balances are updated daily when oracles report changes in total stake. These tokens can be used largely the same as their partners, allowing users to earn staking rewards while still taking advantage of higher yields available across other DeFi protocols (there’s that double-dipping we were mentioning earlier.) LDO, meanwhile, is the governance token for the Lido DAO. The DAO oversees staking protocols, key parameters, and protocol upgrades. Holders are granted voting rights for each token they hold; more LDO means more voting power. Considering apeing into LDO?

    "summary": "This week, TokenInsight takes a look into what is going on with market expectations and fluctuations.",
    "title": "Crypto Bucks the Trend: Market Weekly Review from TokenInsight",
    "detailedContent": "This week, the momentum from within the crypto market and the macro anti-inflation demand became catalysts to push up asset prices, while the impact from regulation became insignificant. Judging from the relevant data on derivatives, the market expectation is obviously higher than last week, and the fluctuation is also relatively lower. Affected by persistent high inflation, investors\u0027 risk appetite is returning to anti-inflation assets, which may be one of the important reasons for the price of cryptos to return to a high level. High inflation, which is difficult to end in the short term, will further push investors to purchase high-yield anti-inflation assets. Mainstream Cryptos \"Back to Peak\" Unlike last month, the market in October was not affected by the expected liquidity crunch. Although the US dollar and US debt yields continued to strengthen, a large number of purchases from the crypto spot market significantly raised asset prices and brought the overall market value of the crypto market back to $2.28T, returning to the level of early September. In terms of trading volume, the daily trading volume of the spot market in early October continued to rise, from $36.82B to $80B on Oct 7. Buying by institutional investors played an important role: on Oct 6, block traders bought $1.6B of bitcoin spot in five minutes through market price orders. It is worth noting that although Huobi Exchange abandoned the Chinese market due to regulatory crackdown, its spot trading volume remained in the top 3 this week, with the highest turnover reaching $7.8B this week. At the same time, market speculation sentiment has dropped significantly. Historical volatility is one of the indicators to monitor market speculation sentiment. From the perspective of historical volatility, as of Oct 8, the daily historical volatility of BTC and ETH decreased by about 10% and 30% respectively compared with last week. From the perspective of options market performance, the implied volatility changes reflect that the options market, which is more concentrated by professional investors, has maintained a relatively stable attitude towards the rapid shift in the crypto market, but the trading of call options is the theme of this week. From Oct 1 to Oct 7, Bitcoin call options trading volume accounted for more than 70% of the total market share, and exceeded 80% at the highest point, which is rare throughout the year. Compared with Bitcoin, the share of Ethereum call options trading is slightly lower, but it also exceeds 60% most of the time. From the perspective of futures premiums, the recovery of market confidence is more obvious than last week. The \"gap\" of the term structure has been smoothed out, on the other hand, the premium of medium and long-term futures has risen significantly compared to last week. The above phenomena all show that investors have considerable bullish sentiment and are willing to pay more premiums to lock in future spot profits. Multiple Factors Push up Crypto Prices, Regulatory Impact is no Longer Significant In terms of supervision, the supervision of the crypto industry by major countries is being further improved with the arrival of October. South Korea\u0027s tax on cryptos is in progress. The European Central Bank is also trying to speed up the adoption of the MICA. in the United States, Coinbase has led the design of a draft regulatory framework for submission to lawmakers. And the US Department of Justice has established a national cryptocurrency enforcement team to address potential crimes in cryptocurrency transactions. From a global perspective, the IMF has issued a set of actionable policies for emerging markets and developing economies to ensure financial stability at a time when cryptocurrencies are adopted globally. In addition, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler said at a House hearing on Tuesday that the SEC has no plans to \"ban\" bitcoin and will not follow other countries in banning cryptocurrencies. He pointed out that the government\u0027s focus is to ensure that the industry complies with investor and consumer protection rules, anti-money laundering regulations and tax laws. On the macro side, the risk of market liquidity tightening has eased significantly, while a new round of liquidity flooding may be coming soon. The Fed\u0027s attitude to reducing liquidity has been repeated. Meister, chairman of the Cleveland Fed, said the Fed\u0027s forecast did not show a sharp rise in interest rates. The Fed\u0027s new strategy is that it will not act until the average inflation rate reaches 2% and basically completes some of its tasks. With US inflation still high above 5% and inflation expectations not falling in the short term, demand for inflation-resistant assets will effectively push up the price of cryptos. The European Central Bank is studying a new bond-buying program to prevent sharp market turbulence when its emergency bond-buying program expires next year. The new program does not yet set a ceiling for debt purchases, but it could be higher than the current $20 billion per month program. The release of liquidity in Europe, one of the main markets for trading cryptos, is expected to lead to a new wave of investment in cryptos. This week, due to the combined influence of persistently high inflation expectations, the uncertainty of the US debt ceiling policy, the statements of the Federal Reserve on liquidity contraction and the strengthening of internal activities in the crypto market, investors have begun to turn to cryptos despite the historically high US debt yields, and regulatory risks have become no longer significant under the strong demand of investors for cryptos. However, compared with September, the general clarity of regulatory boundaries and moderation of attitudes have reduced investors\u0027 risk expectations when investing in cryptos, which may be one of the reasons for the good performance of the crypto market in the first week of October. However, behind the high market rally, short-sellers are also stirring. On the CME exchange, short positions have increased significantly, while the large put options block trading with a size of more than 2500 BTC due on October 22 also indicate that the market may have downside risks from short-sellers and need to be treated with caution.

    "detailedContent": "Powered by Every other week, IntoTheBlock brings you an on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. Strong Buying Activity Propels Bitcoin Above $55k Crypto markets have bounced back strongly, with Bitcoin, in particular, leading the way. Bitcoin has increased as much as 35% over the past seven days with Bitcoin dominance surpassing 45% for the first time in two months. The recent price run-up has been fueled by strong buying activity and positive trends in terms of expectations and on-chain data. In regards to news, many pointed to Brazil exploring legalizing Bitcoin as a method of payment. Brazil’s federal deputy Aureo Riveiro will be presenting a bill to the Chamber of Deputies this week, looking to follow the footsteps of El Salvador. While this is not yet confirmed, the proposal brought optimism into a market that was already pointing higher. Similarly, there is a lot of expectation developing around a Bitcoin ETF potentially being approved as early as this month. Although a decision on physically-backed Bitcoin ETFs was recently postponed, upcoming futures-backed ones appear to be better suited. Eric Balchunas, Senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg gives it a 75% chance that one of the four upcoming futures-backed ETFs gets approved. Source:Twitter While it is uncertain how much these developments are contributing to Bitcoin’s price action, the strong buying activity is undeniable. This is apparent both in the order book and on-chain indicators. As many will know, each trade on an order book has a market maker and a taker. Takers are the ones making market orders by buying at the ask or selling at the bid. High volume from takers in either direction tends to shift prices strongly as they take on the liquidity of the order book, pushing prices higher or lower. IntoTheBlock’s Trades per Side indicator displays the volume being transacted by takers, displaying buy volume as positive numbers and sell orders as negative. Throughout Wednesday morning (EST) it became evident that there was strong buying action taking place, particularly in Binance. As of October 6 using IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin order book indicators Within a minute over 600 BTC was acquired by takers in Binance in two separate instances, highlighting the bullish conviction behind the recent price action. Diving into on-chain activity we also observe strong buying with the number of addresses holding one or more Bitcoin continuously growing throughout the past few months. As of October 6 using IntoTheBlock’s upcoming ownership v2 indicators After dropping significantly in Q2 2021, the number of addresses holding 1 or more Bitcoin has steadily climbed. This signals an accumulation from holders looking to reach 1 BTC and highlights their conviction in the recent surge in price as this number has kept increasing. Given the increasing momentum behind Bitcoin, it is worth taking a look at the next levels that are expected to act as support and resistance. Based on IntoTheBlock’s In/Out of the Money Around Price we can determine price levels around which buying activity has been previously concentrated. Using this, we can anticipate resistance from sellers around the $58,000 price range. As of October 6 using IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin financial indicators 790,000 addresses previously acquired nearly 300k BTC just around $58,000, which makes this the largest cluster of buying activity above the current price. Previous buyers may look to break-even on their positions around this range. Beyond this price level, however, there is little to no resistance expected to prevent new all-time highs. Conversely, if prices were to fall significantly, strong support is expected above $50,000, where 670,000 addresses bought 416k BTC. There is also some buying activity around $54,000 which could act as a significant level for buyers eager to accumulate. Overall, sentiment for Bitcoin has turned positive by many metrics. Strong buying activity is witnessed both in market data and on-chain analytics. Moreover, Bitcoin’s correlation with traditional markets has dropped to near-zero, making it less prone to the recent weakness in stock markets. However, the strong anticipation for both the approval of a Bitcoin ETF in the US and a Brazilian “Bitcoin standard” could act as a roadblock if they don’t go through. Ultimately, though, consensus remains bullish for Bitcoin over the short term.

    "title": "Bridges of Ethereum County: Flipside Crypto",
    "detailedContent": "Bridges are a crucial part of the blockchain ecosystem. As Flipside Crypto analyst @aadharsh2010 pointed out, in last week’s Our Network newsletter, analyzing trends across both directions of these bridges offers a deeper view into DeFi users\u0027 decision-making. Axie Infinity’s Ronin Bridge, for instance, leads the way in the number of transactions. The Terra Bridge, meanwhile, has increased engagement on the Terra network since its launch in March. The same relationship between news interest and traffic/interactive addresses has applied to Solana’s Sollet Bridge in the wake of a massive wave of public interest in Solana. But as @aadharsh2010 notes below, some bridges are inherently more complicated than others. How Bridge Architecture Impacts Transactions The graph below shows that there is only one address that sends transactions to the Matic Ether Bridge’s smart contract. The Matic Ether contract, meanwhile, sends tokens to several addresses. As the chain of contracts that a transaction is routed through is fully represented by a single transaction ID, reading the origin address sidesteps the issue from the previous graph. How Routers Led to the Thorchain Hack As noted here, Thorchain’s ETH router was the point of contact for the July 9 whitehat hack (as well as the later hacks). It appears as though the first hack prompted a partial change in router (as well as some security changes). This change lasted until Thorchain shut down for further security changes. RenBridge as a Counterexample What’s interesting to note about RenBridge is the symmetry with regard to the direction taken across the bridge. In this case, this symmetry occurs because bridge transactions need to be routed to the genesis address to control the mint/release events for renTokens. These tokens are then given to the same address and are considered as valuable as the inputted assets. Conclusions As a whole, it’s clear that bridge traffic and volume increase in both directions with hype and price fluctuations. What remains to be seen is how bridges will continue to exist in a world where every blockchain is inherently built to communicate with one another. There’s legitimate reason for debate regarding the net benefit of cross-chain networking, even if it has put a spotlight on fledgling chains and allowed innovative concepts to spread. There does exist a possibility that bridging and total interoperability in blockchains can lead to a future where the failure of one protocol or blockchain lacks isolation. This could result in legitimate market shocks across the DeFi space. This article contains links to third-party websites or other content for information purposes only (“Third-Party Sites”).

    "title": "An Overleveraged Crypto Market Leads to a 20% Drop: A Data Perspective by IntoTheBlock",
    "detailedContent": "Every other week, IntoTheBlock brings you on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. An Overleveraged Crypto Market Leads to a 20% Drop In the morning of Sept. 7, crypto market sentiment was positive overall: El Salvador officially began to apply their Bitcoin law recognizing Bitcoin as a legal tender. The previous price action candles were bullish at a steady place in what seemed like the farewell to the $50K band price for Bitcoin, but in a matter of hours, all of the crypto market started to sell-off significantly. The crypto market capitalization dropped -20% from $2.37T to $1.97T in barely 12 hours. It quickly after recovered to around $2.0T, where it is at the time of writing, so the plunge accounts so far for a -15% over the last 24 hours. The price fall affected Bitcoin and Ethereum similarly. As of Sept. 8, based on IntoTheBlock’s capital markets insights. While the price fall for Bitcoin was as much as -19% (from $53K to $43K), for Ethereum it accounted for -23% (from $3.9K to $3.0K). The bounce and quick price recovery was 11% for Bitcoin, while 18% for Ethereum. Taking into account these bounces and the last price action data, at the time of writing these price reductions are -14% for Bitcoin and -15% for Ethereum. Even after these drops, Ethereum’s 11.26% price increase in a month-over-month performance is outpacing Bitcoin, which sits around a 5.48% price increase. This data shows that — besides Ethereum being a more volatile asset than Bitcoin — its recent price performance is still better than Bitcoin, even when the market drops considerably. As for market sell-offs, even though they come often in the crypto market, this one did not even turn the month-over-month return negative, and prices are lingering around last week’s levels. Despite some news attributing the price crash to a “buy the rumor, sell the news” strategy due to El Salvador’s law, the data shows that the market was heavily leveraged and some market sell orders unleashed a liquidations cascade on long orders on futures derivatives markets, which exacerbated the price fall considerably. According to Bybit liquidation data, more than $3B has been liquidated in derivatives positions, more than 92% being long positions. Most of those $3B were in Bitcoin ($1.42B), while the other liquidations were notably in Ethereum ($949M) and Ripple ($225M). This is the biggest number of liquidations since the May 19 crash. Using IntoTheBlock data, it can be appreciated how the open interest in perpetual futures derivatives — which is the dollar amount of open positions —has decreased from $16.5B to $11.75B for Bitcoin. These positions usually involve high amounts of leverage. As of Sept. 8, based on IntoTheBlock’s capital markets insights. A reduction in open interest is partially due to liquidations forcing certain positions to close, but also due to traders who decide to close their positions without the need for them to have been liquidated — an action that is expected when the market starts to see high levels of volatility. Open interest data can be put into context by comparing it with the market capitalization of the coin. In this way, a ratio can be obtained that takes into account perpetual futures activity relative to the value of all the coins in circulation. This is the ratio of perpetual swaps open interest to Bitcoin’s market cap, which had been rising, as too many people had bullish leverage positions. In the next chart, it can be seen that when the open interest notional value has been greater than 1.55%, the market has reversed and rapid price action has followed. As of Sept. 8, based on IntoTheBlock’s capital markets insights. Did investors take advantage and buy the dip this time? The exchange flows indicator highlights trends of traders sending money in and out of exchanges. Net flows are positive when more funds are entering than leaving exchanges, and net flows are negative when a greater volume is being withdrawn from exchanges. As it can be seen on Sept. 6, the total balance of Bitcoin that left exchanges was more than the amount entering the exchanges by 8.3K BTC, which is around $428M. This means that many traders and investors took the advantage to buy Bitcoin and send it from centralized exchange to wallet addresses, which supposedly minimizes further selling pressure since the coins need to be located in exchange addresses for them to be able to be sold. As of Sept. 8, based on IntoTheBlock’s capital markets insights. Despite the quick bounce after the sell-off showing conviction by traders, the Sept. 7 price action is not overwhelmingly bullish so far and further price discounts would not be anything surprising. Historically, September has been the month with the worst returns on average for the crypto markets. Overall, this data analysis teaches the lesson that the derivatives market continues to rule the price action for the crypto markets. Furthermore, traders — especially those that use leverage — should consider proceeding with caution when open interest achieves higher and higher amounts and the price continues to grow for several days in a row without some meaningful correction.

    "summary": "This week, TokenInsight takes a deeper look at what is going on in the crypto markets.",
    "title": "Quarterly Delivery, US Dollar Strengthening: Weekly Market Review From TokenInsight",
    "detailedContent": "This week, mainstream cryptos were greatly affected by liquidity factors. Before the FOMC meeting in September, concerns about shrinking liquidity caused a large number of investors to \"withdraw\" from the crypto market, triggering huge market volatility. But considering that it coincides with quarterly derivatives delivery, market volatility is still in the normal range. The size of derivatives delivery in this quarter even slightly exceeded the semi-annual delivery size on Jun 25. Take the options market as an example, the size of options delivered on September 24 is estimated to be no less than $4.712B. The Fed\u0027s interest rate resolution on Thursday eased market tensions and market volatility fell significantly after that. However, considering that US regulators will impose stricter regulatory measures on cryptos in the future and the fact that the marginal contraction of liquidity has begun, the future trend of US dollar liquidity will dominate the market trend in the short and medium term. Before and After Quarterly Delivery: Liquidity Changes Triggered a Sharp Market Shock Since Sep 20, affected by the exodus of market liquidity, the crypto market has once again experienced a sharp downward shock. Bitcoin prices were once below $40,000, and market volatility has jumped due to the combined impact of liquidity changes and the approaching delivery of derivatives. However, from the overall data in Sep, since the sharp drop around Sep 7 has reduced the leverage level of the market to a certain extent, the large-scale exodus of liquidity around Sep 20 did not actually have an excessive impact. From the perspective of implied volatility, the market confidence of professional investors is still relatively strong. Judging from the turnover in the derivatives market, the delivery pressure has been released around Sep 20-22, so the turnover of derivatives on the delivery day is actually not high. As of 15:00 (UTC + 8) on Sep 24, the turnover of perpetual contracts is about $74.3B, of which the trading volume in Binance exchange is about $33.5B, and the trading volume of perpetual contracts on exchanges such as Huobi and Bybit are all around $6B. It is worth noting that Huobi\u0027s intra-exchange perpetual contract positions have recovered. Compared with the last quarterly closing, Huobi\u0027s intra-exchange positions have recovered to about $1.4B, up about 27.3% from the end of the previous quarter. However, from the perspective of skewness and futures premium term structure, the market attitude is still generally cautious. The skewness of mainstream cryptos continues to be negative in the near future, while the October futures products premiums are generally less than 4%, on the edge of negative premium, while the market forward futures premium is relatively stable. Liquidity Contraction Expected to Strengthen, Regulatory Pressure Surged This week, institutional activities had relatively little impact on crypto prices, while regulatory pressure on the crypto market rose sharply again after May. In East Asia, the People\u0027s Bank of China issued a \"Notice on Further Preventing and Handling the Risk of Speculation in Virtual Currency Trading\", which mentioned that overseas crypto exchanges providing services to residents in China through the Internet are also illegal financial activities, and staff providing marketing promotion, payment and settlement, technical support and other services will also be investigated for relevant responsibilities according to law. In addition, South Korea will close more than 40 exchanges that do not meet regulatory requirements on Sep 25. Strong regulation in East Asia may push up market risk aversion, but considering that the volume of transactions from the Asian region has dropped significantly since May, regulatory risks have been basically cleared, and the influence of regulation from the Asian region on the crypto market in the future will be relatively limited. In the US, SEC Chairman Gensler said on Tuesday that the SEC has \"strong\" authority to regulate cryptocurrencies, congress can help regulate stable currencies, and the US Treasury Department said it would impose more sanctions on cryptocurrency services that help illegal practices, with crypto platforms such as \"nested exchanges\", \"hybrid exchanges\" and \"peer-to-peer\" receiving priority attention. In addition, US President Biden plans to nominate Omarova, a law professor who has criticized cryptocurrencies and advocated a greater role for the government in the banking industry, to head the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The US House of Representatives has passed the 2021 defence budget bill, which includes provisions related to cryptocurrencies. It is understood that the defence budget bill usually has broad bipartisan support in the US and is regarded as a must-pass bill. However, the provisions related to cryptocurrencies in the bill may soon be incorporated into law. The bill is currently awaiting Senate approval. At the same time, the proposed bill will require the US Securities Regulatory Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to clearly define which institution supervises which aspects of the crypto market. In addition, Congress will establish a working group composed of representatives of the SEC and CFTC within 90 days of the passage of the bill. There is no doubt that the deflection of US regulatory wind may further promote the outflow of liquidity from the crypto market. Although the Fed\u0027s interest rate resolution on September 24 has not yet released the details of Taper and kept interest rates unchanged, the liquidity contraction has actually begun: the Federal Reserve accepted $1.35T in fixed-rate reverse repos, continuing to brush a record high for five consecutive days. The New York Federal Reserve raised the limit for counterparties in the overnight reverse repos to US $160 billion on Sep 24. At the same time, UK interest rate futures prices show that the Bank of England is slightly more than 80% likely to raise interest rates by 15 basis points by February 2022. Under this influence, US Treasury yields have risen sharply. Although the liquidity contraction will not have a significant impact in the short term, the strength of low-risk assets such as the US dollar under the liquidity contraction will change investors\u0027 risk appetite in the medium and long term, and the liquidity outflow pressure in the crypto market may continue.

    "detailedContent": "Earlier this month, Flipside Crypto unveiled our Art Blocks data and bounties. Now, it’s time to see what our community of expert analysts came up with. See The Best Submissions This time, we’re taking a closer look at two projects on Art Blocks and how they compare: Alien Clocks and Ecumenopolis. To do so, we’ll be getting some help from analysts @Brian_Terra and @lostindefi. Let’s dive in. Alien Clocks: Out-of-This-World, Undervalued and Right on Time First up is a look At Alien Clocks, the Art Blocks playground release by Shvembldr, with help from @Brian_Terra. As @Brian_Terra notes in this submission, the first Alien Clocks sold fast, with all pieces selling out within 1 minute and 46 seconds for a total of 34.1 ETH. So how did they do after-market on Opensea? There were a total of 511 completed sales of 298 different pieces, totaling ~1954 ETH or $5,421,811 (at the time of purchase). But despite these lofty figures, @Brian_Terra argues these pieces are still undervalued — and with good reason. As we can see above, the price of Alien Clocks has been fairly volatile, but with a constant upward direction. Combine that with the upward trajectory of OpenSea sales in general (seen below), and @Brian_Terra believes that Alien Clocks “is an example of an extremely underrated Playground sale on Art Blocks.” Playground Pieces Stay Hot 📈 Next up is a look at Ecumenopolis Project, authored by Joshua Bagley, in a submission from @lostindefi. The submission starts with a look at the rarity of various NFTs using @lostindefi’s rarity score. As we can see above, it seems that “were designed so that each trait has one exceptionally rare value, except for the Scale and Vertigo traits.” However, as @lostindefi notes, this was taken “to the extreme for values of the Lean and Complication traits.” Unsurprisingly, the rarity of these pieces has a major effect on their price, with rarity score effectively representing the price of a given NFT. What has all this meant to the sales of various Ecumenopolis pieces? As we can see below, prices were on the rise until late August, when they quickly began to decrease, indicating a bubble that burst on or around August 29. However, as @lostindefi points out, “this does not mean that it only goes downhill from here. The value of the collection can experience a similar bull run if the attention of the community shifts once again to Art-Blocks or the hype around LOOT settles down after a while.” This article contains links to third-party websites or other content for information purposes only (“Third-Party Sites”).

    "detailedContent": "Affected by the clear expectation of the Federal Reserve\u0027s debt reduction and the downward impact of the US dollar shock, the prices of mainstream cryptos all fell back this week. Volatility is still low, but it has begun to show an upward trend. Interest in crypto futures and ETFs has further increased among traditional institutions. The influence of regulatory authorities on the crypto market has further weakened, but the adjustment of regulatory policies in some countries and the adjustment of fiscal and monetary policies in major countries will have a significant impact in the near future. Subscribe Join us in showcasing the cryptocurrency revolution, one newsletter at a time. Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox, along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right, millions love us!) — what are you waiting for? New Uncertainty Is Being Priced This week, macro factors are still the dominant factor in the crypto market. From the perspective of volatility, the historical volatility of mainstream cryptos began to rise slowly after hitting its lowest point on Monday, but the range is relatively small. Professional investors\u0027 expectations for Bitcoin are relatively stable, while the market expectations for Ethereum have been significantly lowered, and the recent stabilization of Ethereum price fluctuations may be the main reason. It is worth noting that the volatility of mainstream cryptos has shown an upward trend this weekend. With the opening of the Jackson Hole Global Central Bank Summit, the convergence control of central banks on liquidity will significantly affect the expectations of investors in the crypto market, which in turn will affect the price of cryptos. Judging from the term structure of the futures premium, due to the recent increase in market volatility and investors\u0027 concerns about the uncertainty of the scale of liquidity reduction, the futures premium for the next week and the next month has declined significantly. Among them, the front-month futures on the CME Exchange all showed a significant negative premium on Friday. At the same time, the futures premium for the current quarter on the major futures exchanges has also narrowed significantly. Although investors are still optimistic about the market\u0027s forward prospects, the forward futures premium expiring on June 24 of the following year on the Deribit Exchange, which provides annual futures, has declined to a certain extent. In addition, the forward skewness of mainstream cryptos has also declined due to macro factors. Derivatives markets are undergoing the process of incorporating new uncertainties into pricing. Regulatory Impact Is Limited, and the Influence of Derivatives and Macro Factors May be Further Enhanced This week, many major countries have made some moves in supervision, but most of them have shown their attitudes and their actual influence is far less than that of the second quarter. Regulators in Britain, China, and other countries have once again issued risk warnings for crypto transactions, but they have not had a significant impact on the market. SEC Chairman Gensler said the SEC will solicit opinions to determine whether digital customer interaction innovations adopted by financial companies should follow existing rules or whether new rules are needed. Local cryptocurrency companies in India are asking the government to consider making the International Financial Services Center Authority (IFSCA) in Gujarat the regulator of all crypto transactions in India, because they believe that the new draft bill may give Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies the status of commodities rather than currencies, and companies will be subject to local KYC compliance. The regulatory attitude of small countries tends to be positive. El Salvador is continuing the process of legalizing bitcoin, and the Cuban government said that its central bank will set rules for encrypted currency and decide how to issue licenses to relevant service providers in Cuba, while making it clear that no illegal activities will be involved. It is worth noting that Iran will lift the ban on cryptocurrency mining on September 22. Previously, Iran banned cryptocurrency mining for a short period of time due to excessive electricity pressure in the summer. It is expected that with the lifting of the ban, the progress of the recovery of computing power across the network will be further accelerated. Considering the strong correlation between computing power and asset prices, Iran\u0027s action is undoubtedly an important benefit to the market. Traditional financial institutions have been more active in the crypto markets this week. PayPal (PYPL. O) is expanding its cryptocurrency service to the UK. This is the first time since October 2020 that PayPal has expanded its cryptocurrency service outside the United States. Traditional financial data service organizations are also considering incorporating crypto market data into the service atmosphere: MSCI\u0027s CEO recently said that the company is studying cryptocurrency-related products. As Wall Street continues its push into cryptos, Citigroup is considering offering bitcoin futures trading to its largest customer base as the banking giant awaits regulatory approval to begin trading futures from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart believe that VanEck and ProShares quickly withdrew their proposals for the Ethereum futures ETF, which is a good sign for potential bitcoin futures ETFs, because the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) allows such applications to remain active. Bitcoin futures ETFs may be launched as early as October. At the same time, the SEC may approve multiple bitcoin futures ETFs to be listed at the same time to avoid forming a first-mover advantage. For traditional institutions, whether ETFs or banks, the use of the purchase of futures to enter the crypto market investment has become a more common method. The entry of large amounts of funds will lead to the further enhancement of the impact of the derivatives market on the spot market and asset prices, and the effectiveness of derivatives-related factors predicting the market may further increase. The impact of macro factors on the US dollar and crypto markets has increased significantly. U.S. PMI data and initial jobless claims data performed poorly, but the GDP performance in the second quarter was slightly higher than the previous value, and its impact on the U.S. dollar also caused fluctuations in the crypto market. Liquidity risks are rising again: George, the chairman of the Kansas Fed, said there was a \"strong case\" for tapering more quickly than last time. He argued that the Fed should start tapering this year because the economic recovery is progressing well and inflation is rising strongly, indicating an opportunity to reduce asset purchases, while Mr. Bullard said the Fed was agreeing on a plan to scale back its bond purchases and that there was little risk that Delta virus would delay the tapering of quantitative easing. He believes that the Fed should start tapering its bond purchases until the first quarter of 2022, before starting to shrink its balance sheet. ‍ The Jackson Hole annual summit of global central banks on Aug. 27-28 will have a profound impact on the crypto market. The theme of this annual meeting is \"Macroeconomic Policy in an Unbalanced Economy\". Chairman Powell of the Federal Reserve will deliver a speech at the meeting. According to past experience, it is expected that the Federal Reserve may give clues to the reduction of bond purchases at that time. The market expects Powell to guide the market in the direction of the reduction of bond purchases during the annual meeting, and give a clear path for the reduction of bond purchases in subsequent meetings. The news of the reduction of bond purchases is beneficial to the strength of the US dollar. Considering the strong correlation between the crypto market and the US dollar, the good performance of cryptos in the near and medium term can be expected. However, the further impact of the liquidity contraction on the crypto market still needs to be continuously observed.

    "detailedContent": "Every other week, IntoTheBlock brings you on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. Macro Uncertainty Drags Down Crypto One word has been the main point of discussion over the past couple of weeks, either in traditional finance or in crypto markets: Evergrande. The biggest property developer of China is on the verge of a default. This news has influenced the macro perspective of many investors around the world, who fear that its collapse could have a domino effect over the Chinese economy and end up affecting markets all around the globe (most importantly in the U.S. market, which is China\u0027s biggest trade partner). Investor positioning started to be bearish as more and more news about the situation started to hit the media. A moderate sell off started already in the weekend, in part influenced by the weak price action of the last week over most markets. Monday morning, the markets opened in red and the sell-off increased, with the crypto markets following and falling considerably. Bitcoin dropped from the $47,000 price mark that was holding during the weekend to $42,300 at the start of the day. The selling pressure increased as soon as the bell rang in the U.S. market open, dragging down Bitcoin to a low of $40,000 in spot markets along the day, accounting for a total of a -15% correction since the start of this week. Since then, the market has bounced back to the $43,000, where it is hovering now: Data as of Sept. 22 via IntoTheBlock Ethereum reacted in a similar way to Bitcoin, dropping from the $3,500 price mark of the weekend to a lowest of $2,800, which would sum up as a correction of a -16% since the start of this week. The price has recovered as well to the psychological resistance of $3,000: Data as of Sept. 22 via IntoTheBlock As it is well known among crypto investors, both Bitcoin and Ethereum price action have a high correlation between each other. This means that these two asset prices vary similarly both in the upward movements as in the downward movements. It can be observed in the next chart how its correlation trend to be way closer to 1 than to 0: Data as of Sept. 22 via IntoTheBlock Seasoned investors always try to minimize the correlation between the assets of their portfolio. This is a practice that improves diversification, since negative market movements will not impact the whole portfolio as much and market sell-offs are slightly more mitigated. Not only do cryptocurrencies have high correlation between them, but they also show a high correlation with certain traditional market assets as well. The recent crypto market price action has been led by traditional markets activity, so it is useful to be aware of the correlations that historically crypto markets have had with traditional markets. The next chart shows the correlation of BTC and ETH with major Western indexes: Data as of Sept. 22 via IntoTheBlock As can be seen, correlation oscillates between values of -1 to 1. A correlation coefficient close to 1 implies a strong correlation, so a positive price movement relationship between the two prices. A correlation near 0 suggests no correlation and a correlation close to -1 points to a strong negative correlation (meaning that the price of Bitcoin and the asset in question tend to move in opposite directions). Both charts show how the correlation with Ethereum and Bitcoin is high with the major U.S. index (S\u0026P 500, Dow Jones or Russell 2000), or other major index like the German DAX index, for the case of Bitcoin. On paper, this means that price movements in these index have a high probability of affecting Bitcoin and Ethereum similarly. This correlation with finance from traditional markets has been increasing as more institutions choose to invest in cryptocurrencies. When the market experiences a sell-off, the portfolio of these institutions need to be rebalanced (often done automatically by algorithms), with the goal of maintaining a constant percentage of each asset relative to their whole portfolio. Furthermore, there is another reason that worsens the situation: cryptocurrencies are considered in finance as a riskier investment vehicle than other traditional finance products due to their high volatility: Data as of Sept. 22 via IntoTheBlock This is a factor to consider amid a sharp market sell-off, since investors are more willing to reduce exposure to riskier assets than to assets that behave relatively steady. This behavior acts as a feedback loop, and cryptocurrencies end up usually suffering sharper discounts than other less volatile products. The lesson learned this time is that it is worth keeping an eye out of the crypto ecosystem and being aware of global events that shake the traditional finance markets like the recent one of Evergrande. These have a considerable effect in the whole crypto markets as well, and this time the event was not led by sudden news but by a series of events that have been developing for weeks. Risk management techniques can be taken into account in anticipation of a similar event, expecting that it could have a high probability of impacting traditional financial markets. Despite the uncertainty that still persists on the global markets, the macro view of cryptocurrencies continues to be positive. Inflation continues to be relatively high, and cryptocurrencies are more and more a staple in the portfolio of investors and institutions alike. The three month returns of both Bitcoin and Ethereum shows 26% and 42% respectively. These corrections could present an interesting buying opportunity for investors that were still waiting for a deeper market correction, considering that most major cryptocurrencies prices are discounted 30% from their all-time high prices.

    "title": "Market Volatility Stronger, Recent Expectations Lower: Market Review From TokenInsight",
    "detailedContent": "Affected by the sharp drop in the prices of mainstream cryptos on Sept. 7, market volatility has increased significantly, but it has now stabilized. The difference of volatility has narrowed significantly, and as of Sept. 10, Ethereum\u0027s difference of volatility has taken the lead in becoming positive, indicating that the market may remain in the downward range for the time being. SOL and other non-Ethereum public chain tokens are less affected by market fluctuations, and there is obvious differentiation within the market. The actions of Southeast Asian regulators have frustrated the overseas distribution of some exchanges, but the legalization process of cryptos is advancing rapidly in Ukraine, El Salvador, Switzerland, and other countries. Sweden, Mexico, and other countries have also shown a more moderate attitude towards cryptos. Liquidity tightening is expected to be postponed again. Considering the attitude of regulators in various countries, confidence in the crypto market is still relatively sufficient. As the quarterly delivery season approaches, high market volatility will continue. Mainstream Cryptos Plummeted, Causing Market Volatility to Soar On Sept. 7, the crypto market ended its low volatility for nearly three weeks. Affected by the rapid decline in mainstream crypto prices, the market experienced a sharp rise in volatility and returned to the medium-high volatility range. Bitcoin volatility rose above 80, while Ethereum volatility rose above 110 and is currently stable at a high level. Bitcoin prices fell 6.3% this week, while Ethereum prices fell slightly more, at 9.79%. Market trading volume also rose with volatility to the highest level in three months. On Sept. 8, the spot market trading volume reached $146.47B, of which Huobi exchange trading volume reached $19.7B, and Binance exchange trading volume reached $69.7B, which once led to exchange downtime. In terms of perpetual contract trading, Huobi\u0027s perpetual contract trading volume reached $30.7B on that day, while Binance\u0027s one-day perpetual contract trading volume exceeded $110B, and the whole market\u0027s perpetual contract trading volume reached more than $251.1B. HT, BNB, and other exchange tokens were also affected by the market crash, with prices falling by more than 20%. At present, the general view in the market is that the crash on Sept. 7 was \"accidental\" due to multiple factors. On the one hand, due to the strong US dollar against the trend, investors\u0027 risk appetite declined, which tended to be high profit-taking. Before the crash on the evening of Sept. 7, some large investors placed orders on Coinbase to sell their positions that afternoon. Against the background of long-term low volatility, the degree of long-side leverage is high, and the sales of large investors lead to a chain of liquidation, stop loss, and stampede in the spot and derivatives markets. A similar situation also has occurred in January, due to miners selling at a profit. On the other hand, some investors also believe that the decline was caused by the attraction of funds from high-speed public chain tokens such as Solana, or due to the increase in risk aversion in the market due to the SEC\u0027s warning on Coinbase\u0027s upcoming lending business. But overall, the first possibility is relatively higher. Judging from the futures premium term structure and skewness structure, investors remain cautious about the near future. The near futures premium is at a low level in the week, while CME and other exchanges even have negative premiums. However, investors\u0027 confidence in the medium and long term has not changed significantly, which still maintains a neutral state. European Regulatory Attitude Us Favorable to the Market, and the High Volatility May Continue in September This week, regulatory attitudes from major capital markets have changed significantly, and the European region has shown an unprecedented positive attitude towards the crypto market. The UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) this week mainly expressed their concerns about the excessive risks in the crypto market. The ESMA recognized the innovative achievements of cryptos and distributed book technology, but it also shared the FCA\u0027s concerns about the risks that unregulated investment activities may bring, the high volatility risk of the crypto market itself, and the risk that the risks of the crypto market spread to the real economy. At a time when major exchanges are trying to meet compliance requirements and deleverage, the attitude in Europe is actually relatively positive, because the development of the crypto market has been officially recognized. Against this background, the Swiss Financial Regulatory Authority (FINMA) officially approved the compliance licenses of six crypto exchanges this week and authorized SIX Digital Exchange AG to serve as the central depository of tokens, and its affiliated company SDX Trading AG to serve as the tokens exchange. This is the first time that Switzerland has issued a license for the infrastructure to promote tokens trading and its comprehensive settlement, combining the regulatory framework in traditional markets to achieve comprehensive supervision of crypto trading, clearing, and custody. Considering Switzerland\u0027s position in European and world finance, Switzerland\u0027s approach undoubtedly provides a model for the future regulatory form of European countries. In addition, after El Salvador, Ukraine passed the proposal to legalize cryptos, becoming the second country to formally support the legalization of cryptos and the first European country to pass the proposal to legalize cryptos. Central banks and regulatory agencies in Sweden, Mexico, and other countries regard crypto investment as commodity investment. While clarifying its risk attributes, they formally recognize the status of cryptos as investment products. Compared with Europe, the regulatory action in Asia is relatively strict. The Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong said that it would expand the scope of supervision, strengthen the importance of licenses, and will actively crackdown on unlicensed transactions, and implement regulations on over-the-counter derivatives. In Southeast Asia, the measures have been more severe: Huobi\u0027s services in Thailand and Binance\u0027s services in Singapore have been suspended for regulatory reasons. The European Central Bank announced this week that it would slow down its bond purchases, but at the same time said that it had not reduced its bond purchases, but only calibrated the original bond purchase plan and announced that it would keep the original interest rate unchanged. For the crypto market, both Europe and the United States, the possibility of liquidity contraction during the year is decreasing, and long-standing concerns about liquidity tightening have been eased. However, the high volatility that began on Sept. 7 did not show obvious signs of decline. On the one hand, due to the general rise in other tokens\u0027 volatility in the market, the overall market volatility has not yet reached a stable stage. On the other hand, the delivery date of derivatives is approaching, and quarterly derivatives delivery tends to bring greater market volatility. It can be predicted that the high volatility of the market will continue in the near future, which is conducive to the volatility strategy, but investors still need to pay more attention to risk control.

    "summary": "Flipside Crypto takes a look into what token airdrops are.",
    "title": "Airdrop Analysis by Flipside Crypto: FEI, UNI and 1inch",
    "detailedContent": "We know that airdrops are a common way that new projects, protocols, and tokens look to bring in new users, hopefully, those that will become long-term holders and active participants in the ecosystem. But that isn’t always how airdrops played out. As we saw in our analysis of Terra airdrops, these distributions often see users decline to claim their tokens, while those that do claim often swap or otherwise dump the currency. So, how have airdrops impacted the ecosystems surrounding projects like Uniswap, FEI, and 1inch? With help from Flipside’s own @BlumbergKellen and our on-chain data, we can see how airdrop recipients have used their tokens. The answer? Most aren’t holding onto them for very long. According to our analysis, less than half of these airdropped tokens are held or “kept” by recipients — that is, they weren’t swapped for other tokens or transferred to a central exchange. 1inch Airdrops Lead the Way for Holders We’ll start by taking a closer look at 1inch airdrops. So far, there have been three distributions — one in February of 2020, one a year later in February of 2021, and a final event on July 31 of this year. All told, roughly 91 million 1INCH tokens were distributed in these three events. But, as Flipside’s on-chain data reveals, nearly 40 percent of those tokens have been either swapped or transferred to a centralized exam within 24 hours. Within a week, that rate has jumped to nearly 50%, and after 90 days, as we can see in the data below, 36.3% of tokens are considered “kept.” More than a quarter of these tokens, meanwhile, have been swapped for other currencies, with others being transferred to centralized exchanges. FEI and TRIBE Airdrops See Heavy Swaps These results mostly hold true when we examine other airdrop events. That includes FEI and TRIBE airdrops — most of these projects saw an even smaller rate of tokens kept following airdrops. In fact, while more than 90% of the total supply of airdropped tokens were claimed for both projects, 27.6% of the airdropped FEI and TRIBE tokens are considered “kept.” As we can see in the graph below, more than 50% of both airdropped FEI and TRIBE tokens have been swapped for other currencies (as represented by the blue bar). According to @BlumbergKellen, most FEI holders held their tokens for less than one week before selling. This sell pressure likely led to the dramatic price decrease that took place in the early days of FEI. TRIBE holders meanwhile, did tend to hold on to their tokens for a bit longer. In fact, nearly 50% held for more than a week. With enough time, however, these users also tended to sell their holdings. UNI Airdrops See the Fewest Tokens Kept Uniswap airdrop recipients, in comparison, did not tend to sell or swap their UNI tokens as quickly nor as often as FEI and TRIBE holders. But that doesn’t mean they are holding on to their airdropped tokens. In fact, 23.4 percent of users kept their tokens by our measurement. As we can see in the table below, nearly 40 percent of users swapped or sold their tokens. Nearly 20 percent, meanwhile, were transferred to a central exchange — far more than the FEI or TRIBE airdrops. By contrast, five percent of users go on to provide liquidity on the platform. Conclusions As we can see in the data above, the vast majority of users who receive tokens as part of airdrop events do not hold on to their tokens or use them to become involved in the respective ecosystems. This follows many of the same patterns we saw in our analysis of Terra airdrops. Flipside Crypto is back with more airdrop analysis. How have airdrops impacted the Uniswap, FEI and 1inch communities?",

    "summary": "Flipside Crypto continues its airdrop analysis series via on-chain data with a look at the addresses that received original Mirror airdrops.",
    "title": "How Many Addresses Are Receiving Airdrops?: Flipside Crypto",
    "detailedContent": "Airdrops are a fixture in crypto, particularly for protocols looking to add new users to the ecosystem. But what are the real-world results of these airdrops? Using Flipside Crypto’s on-chain data and community-enabled analytics, we can find the answers. We already know from previous airdrop analyses that weekly airdrops struggle to add new users to the Terra ecosystem. When it comes to Uniswap, meanwhile, 23.4 percent of users kept their tokens by our measurement. Now, it’s time to take a closer look at how many addresses received the original Mirror airdrop to UNI holders and LUNA stakers, respectively. To do so, we’re enlisting the help of two of our analysts — @jr3225 and @darksoulsfanlol. UNI Holders vs LUNA Stakers We’ll start with an analysis from @jr3225, who began by identifying whether LUNA stakers or UNI holders claimed more MIR as part of their initial airdrop. During this Genesis airdrop, which took place in December of last year, users claimed nearly 9 million of the 9.15 million total rewards available. And, as @jr3225 notes, “while 12,698 UNI addresses have claimed MIR via airdrops, only 1009 LUNA stakers have claimed MIR via airdrops.” But, perhaps surprisingly, while UNI addresses outweighed the total LUNA addresses by a factor of roughly 12x. LUNA stakers have claimed about 8.91 million MIR while UNI holders have only claimed roughly 2.79 million MIR. The Lucky Few to Claim Both Airdrops These groups, however, were not mutually exclusive. As this submission from @darksoulsfanlol points out, there were a lucky few who claimed both airdrops on ETH (by holding UNI) and Terra (by staking LUNA). In fact, according to @darksoulsfanlol, “a total of 93 addresses that claimed both airdrops on ETH and Terra for the genesis airdrop and 568 addresses that claimed the genesis airdrop on ETH and any genesis or weekly airdrop on Terra.” Conclusions So what can we take from this community analysis of MIR airdrops? @jr3225 found that “LUNA stakers are simply more aware of MIR.” What\u0027s more, “UNI holders generally don’t know as much about the Terra ecosystem” — which could explain the disparity in claimed amounts. This submission also noted that lost keys or wallets could account for “at least a percentage of unclaimed MIR.” Get the rest of the insights here. And, as @darksoulsfanlol notes, “Terrans claimed a lot more MIR tokens than UNI holders, the number of addresses that claimed on Terra is only about 10% of the number of addresses of UNI holders,” which could indicate large whale allocations and less reach. This submission also noted that a more fair strategy for airdrop distribution could be to do it by weekly distribution. See more data and insights from @darksoulsfanlol here.

    "title": "Get Ready for a Curveball: A Deep Dive Into Curve by Flipside Crypto",
    "detailedContent": "Hope you’re ready for a curveball — community-enabled analytics on Curve protocol are coming to Flipside Crypto. That means labeled, on-chain data, bounties and more, all focused on the popular protocol. Before our bounties and other goodies arrive, however, we want to make sure you’re armed with all you need to know about the AMM and decentralized exchange. So, with that in mind, it’s time to take a deep dive into Curve protocol, including what it is, how it works, its native currency, and more. Let’s take a closer look. What Is Curve? ↩️ As we mentioned above, Curve is an automated market maker and decentralized exchange on the Ethereum network. It first made its debut in early 2020, and quickly garnered attention for its high total volumes and deposits. Curve is a non-custodial exchange that enables users to swap between various stablecoins — hence its reputation as a “Uniswap for stablecoins.” It’s known for low fees and low slippage, designed to make it easier for users to execute trades. Curve sets itself apart from other exchanges by using liquidity pools to execute these trades, rather than matching buyers and sellers directly. Liquidity providers are rewarded for providing liquidity to these pools, often with rather high APRs. However, these APRs, while higher than rates provided by other DeFi pools, can be quite volatile, leading to lower-than-expected returns. LPs also get rewarded for their deposits in various other ways. They can receive deposit bonuses, for example, if they deposit coins with low balances into specific pools, for example, or participate in incentivized pools. These feature additional rewards for LPs on top of the usual trading and lending fees. What Is CRV? 🪙 The CVR token, also known simply as CRV, is the native currency for the Curve protocol. It\u0027s also the governance token for the CurveDAO. It’s primarily used to reward the liquidity providers that help make the protocol’s low-fee swaps possible. As of November of last year, each trade on the platform features a .04% fee that is used to fund those rewards. That rate declines annually, however. Deposits and withdrawals, meanwhile, incur fees of between 0% and.02% depending on their previous balance. CRV Price History 📈📉 As of Monday at 12:00 PM ET, CRV was trading at roughly $2.37. That’s a significant decrease from its all-time high, which saw the token trade at nearly $7 in September of 2020. The price of CRV declined quickly following that high, trading at less than $1 for most of Q4 2020 before beginning to rise in early 2021. In recent weeks, the token has recovered from a fall to roughly $1.33 on May 22 to its current price of $2.37.

    "title": "A Look at Cardano’s Key Metrics: A Data Perspective by IntoTheBlock",
    "detailedContent": "Every week, IntoTheBlock brings you on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. A Look at Cardano’s Key Metrics In the past week the renowned smart contract platform Cardano has been experiencing significant positive price action. It’s native token ADA had its price closing in on the $3 mark during Monday 23rd making it the third biggest crypto currency ranked by market cap. Much speculation and volatility has been seen around the token since the development team announced the launch of the Alonzo hard fork. The highly-awaited fork is expected to deploy smart contracts onto Cardano’s mainnet. This will allow developers to build applications on top of the Cardano platform, creating its own ecosystem. In this article we will explore key metrics about Cardano’s recent price fluctuations and what effect it had on our indicators. We will also cover important aspects about the Alonzo Fork and how this could shape the token’s future. The Search Trends indicator, as the name describes it, shows trends in google searches over the last 90 days in relation with price of the token. Google shows this chart on a relative basis with a max score of 100 on the day that had the most google searches for that keyword. As of Aug. 21, 2021 via IntoTheBlock’s Cardano Analytics This helps to show the relation and importance of google searches which could mark “trends in culture” with the direct effect it has over the price of a specific token. Some tokens are affected more than others by this type of activity. In this example we can see how on May 25th searches for the word “Cardano” were at a score of 54, while on August 20th right before the token’s all time high on August 23rd the searches were at a score of 100. With its growing popularity is also worth having a look at the investment profitability of the token current holders. For any address with a balance of tokens, IntoTheBlock identifies the average price (cost) at which those tokens were purchased and compares its current price. If Current Price is greater than Average Cost, address is “In the Money.” If Current Price is less than Average Cost, address is “Out of the Money.” As of Aug. 25, 2021 via IntoTheBlock’s Cardano Analytics The indicator shows that 97% of the addresses are currently “In The Money”, meaning they are profiting on paper. In addition it depicts that there was great amounts of activity between the range of $1.68 to $2.24.This stands as a sign of support since 307.2k addresses traded around this price with an approximate of 5.12 billion ADA in volume. Having 97% of the addresses at profit is also a positive sign since most of these addresses will not be seen into a position of pressure selling. It\u0027s also worth mentioning the high correlation ADA currently holds with BTC. While this range may appear as a clear support for the token, since we are still in the early stages of the evolving crypto space most tokens still have a high correlation to BTC, meaning that if Bitcoin’s price drops significantly Cardano is likely to follow suit. In addition, another interesting trend to keep an eye on are the perpetual swaps contracts since this provides insights of trading activity and positioning of the market. This indicator depicts the volume traded of perpetual swaps contracts on the top centralized exchanges. Total volume is calculated by multiplying the total number of contracts traded times the dollar value of each. As of Aug. 21, 2021 via IntoTheBlock’s Cardano Analytics This indicator is a great way to measure increasing trading activity and volatility. On Monday August 23rd, the indicator recorded a total of $11.24 billion traded on perpetual swaps contracts. Pointing to the high trading activity experienced over the ADA token which took the price near the $3 value reaching its all time high of $2.95, with an impressive market cap of nearly $100 billion ranking as the 3rd biggest token by market cap after Bitcoin and Ethereum. Finally, one important indicator that highlights the overview of the current state of the Cardano token is the ownership distribution by time held. This indicator groups the token holders based on how long their addresses have managed to hold the token. Hodlers are passive investors that have held the asset for more than 1 year, Cruisers have a holding period of 1 to 12 months, while Traders hold the asset for less than 30 days. As of Aug. 21, 2021 via IntoTheBlock’s Cardano Analytics The indicator shows that its great majority of token holdings, about 74%, belong to the cruisers category. This category stands for the addresses that have held the coin for a period of 1 to 12 months usually being a group that those not have created attachment and familiarity with the core concepts that make up this development. This suggests that these addresses could be tempted to take profits in a shorter time span in comparison to the hodlers, which have a longer and more passive perspective. It\u0027s also worth mentioning that the hodlers category has been increasing during the past months, showing an increase of 0.83% since the month of May. Currently Cardano is getting ready to deploy the smart contracts, in the Alonzo Fork, bringing the network closer to its full capabilities and goals, also marking the end to Shelley era on its roadmap and the beginning of the Goguen era. The fork currently on testnet is scheduled to be realized to the public in this third quarter. This major fork will pave the way for decentralized apps to start deploying smart contracts onto the network and begin building the Cardano ecosystem. As an important milestone and significant step dapps will start to develop, combined with Cardano’s impressive current momentum it will be an important developing ecosystem to keep an eye on.

    "detailedContent": "Our coin price charts have always been one of the most important features on CoinMarketCap — and we know how important they are, so we put in lots of effort to make them even better! On the chart, all the data you like remains the same: you can still view the price movements or market capitalization with volume change in the specific time frame you are interested in. But, we did add some new touches that we hope you like! A better color scheme to indicate price movements in the timeframe vs. the opening price; When you first enter the coin pages, the default time period changed from “All time” to “1D” to show a more recent trend of the coin prices and market capitalization; The chart now is more light-weight and loads way faster than before — but with a more trendy design! There are also a few small interactions that are now different. Please be aware of the following: When users want to focus on a smaller period of time, you used to “drag and focus” — in the new version, simply scroll the mouse, or if you are on your mobile device, pull up and down to change the focused timeframe; When you are on your mobile device and want to take a look at the price/volume information on a tooltip, please tap and hold to show the tooltip boxes.",

    "title": "Making Sense of May 19 Volatility: Flipside Crypto",
    "detailedContent": "We’re back to taking a closer look at mid-May’s bear market blues. We previously examined the volatility and chaos in the market last month as prices for tokens around the ecosystem fell, and fell hard. Then, it was all about rapidly declining values for meme tokens, big spikes in liquidations, and massive token inflows on CEXes and DEXes alike. But how did all this chaos play out for traders? Well, as @BlumbergKellen shows us with labeled on-chain data via Velocity, May 19 was a tough day for transaction fees and a busy one for whales. Gas Goes Sky-High ⛽ The chaos started fairly early in the morning on May 19, at least for American traders. At roughly 9am EST, there was a massive spike in transaction fees. That spike would leave ripples that resounded throughout the day, with average transaction fees a new high for May. Whale’s Tales 🐋 Why were gas fees so high you ask? Well, because as prices dropped around the crypto ecosystem, traders, especially whales, rushed to get their funds out and avoid being liquidated. As we can see in the chart below, May 19 saw a massive jump in whale activity, with the number of high-value transactions (here defined as those worth more than $100,000) climbing 30% higher than its previous peak. Safe to say that May 19 was a day that most crypto traders won’t be forgetting any time soon.

    "detailedContent": "Every week, TokenInsight brings you a weekly crypto news roundup in collaboration with CoinMarketCap, TokenInsight is a leading Data \u0026 Tech-driven Blockchain Financial Institution. Before Christmas, we witness a new history again. On EST 8:42:11, Dec. 16, 2020, Bitcoin went over the cliff of $20,000, finally. One small tick for the price, one giant leap for the crypto market. In this year, we have witnessed so many miracles from crypto markets: Bitcoin jumped up from $5,000 to higher than $20,000, DeFi’s boom started changing the financial ecosystem fundamentally, the crypto options market flourished and matured gradually, and the crypto itself stepped into the hall from the bleak corner and became the new star welcomed by institutions and capital markets. Moreover, a series of new technologies and concepts will change finance, economics and the whole world from bottom to the top. The new year is coming, praying for the future? We are in the future. Merry Christmas and Hallelujah. Enjoy your vacation and our review. Bitcoin Stands Above the New Peak Before that moment, Bitcoin’s price and the trading volume kept comparatively flat, around $19,000 and $3 billion per day respectively until Dec. 16. However, even though Bitcoin had amassed enough power stealthily, investors thought that 2020 will end with a flat rhythm. From Dec. 16, the price of Bitcoin rose quickly and broke through $20,000 on 8:42 EST, Dec. 16 2020. The market seethes. Bitcoin’s daily trading volume jumps to $10 billion, which is the largest in the last 30 days. The price also does not stop its step. As of 9pm on Dec. 17, Bitcoin’s price once hit $23,652 and has kept above the $20,000 line for more than 40 hours. BTC price and historical trading volume in the last 30 days, chart from 9pm EST, Dec. 17. Source: tokeninsight.com Who Is the First? As Bitcoin’s price soared up to all-time high, TokenInsight analyzed the six minutes of trading data around that breaking point from five major exchanges — Binance, Bitfinex, Coinbase, Huobi and OKEx — and we found something interesting. Breaking time when Bitcoin hit $20,000, Dec. 16. Source: tokeninsight.com What Happened During the All-Time High Moment? The following figure shows the comparison of the number of transactions on various exchanges within six minutes before and after Bitcoin broke $20,000. Transactions info when Bitcoin hit $20,000, Dec. 16. Source: tokeninsight.com Transactions are concentrated on small size orders less than one Bitcoin. Among the five exchanges, 132,885 small transactions (orders less than one Bitcoin) happened in total during those six minutes, accounting for nearly 98% of all transactions. Huobi and Binance contributed the most, accounting for 65,096 and 38,963 respectively. Huobi has 64,022 small transactions. OKEx has the highest proportion of small transactions, reaching 98.54% of its total. OKEx, Huobi and Binance account for a significantly higher percentage of small transactions than Bitfinex and Coinbase. Meanwhile, large transactions occurred quite often on Bitfinex, reaching 164 in total, while OKEx only has six trades, —but the largest order appears in OKEx is a 14.93 Bitcoin buying order, dealing with $19,900. Bid Orders 3X Surpass the Ask Orders in Large Transactions Bitcoin buying demand far exceeds selling demand. Among the executed orders, the quantity of the bid orders is 1.41 times of the ask orders. The transaction volume of the bid orders is 1.82 times higher than the volume of the ask orders. At the same time, the larger the volume, the stronger the demand for bid orders. In large transactions greater than five Bitcoin, the number and the transaction volume of bid orders are as high as 275 and 2,781 Bitcoin, respectively. The number and the transaction volume of ask orders are 89 and 893 Bitcoin. Bitcoin orders amounts and volume comparison, Dec. 16. Source: tokeninsight.com Ethereum Keeps Tepid Nevertheless, is the price rise this time just a flash in the pan like before? From the perspective of Ethereum, reactions from the crypto market are seemingly not so hot. After Ethereum 2.0 launched officially, the price of ETH stabilized between $500 and $600, and it just went up by about 10% after 40 hours from Bitcoin breaking through $20,000, which is far lower than Bitcoin, and the highest daily trading volume is just $3.33 billion, not the highest level of this month. BTC price and historical trading volume in the last 30 days, chart from 9pm EST, Dec. 17. Source: tokeninsight.com ETH’s weekly performance is not shining like BTC either, and the trading volume of ETH’s spot and perpetual are just half of BTC’s volume approximately. Generally speaking, the fluctuation of ETH is more than BTC, but it is lower than BTC this week. When we think about the high correlation between them, this condition seems abnormal. What’s the future trend of the crypto market? Maybe the options markets’ performance can reveal some signs. BTC and ETH trading volume info of this week, chart from 9pm EST, Dec. 17. Source: tokeninsight.com Information From Futures, Options From Investors Futures and options are one kind of derivatives which imply future information, including investors’ thoughts for the futures markets, for both futures and options are executed someday after the buying day. Investors often buy futures and call options when they feel optimistic, and they will sell futures and buy put options when they have a cautious attitude to the market. The market is the aggregation of investors. Therefore, futures and options’ trading volumes are valid indicators for knowing the trend of the crypto market. Rising trading volume in the derivative market means investors have interests in the future, but shrinking trading volume means a more cautious view. BTC futures and perpetual options historical trading volume in the last 30 days, chart from 9pm EST, Dec. 17. Source: tokeninsight.com and skew.com When we have a look at the trading volume in last week, it is easy to find that investors’ confidence for the BTC is strengthened after Bitcoin hit $20,000: before that moment, the trading volume was lower than $25 billion per day on average, but after that, trading volume soared up to $80.4 billion. But we couldn\u0027t distinguish the future according to trading volume only. The open interest is another indicator often reflecting market participation. Compared with recent weeks, the open interest of Bitcoin futures reached a new peak after Bitcoin broke all-time high records, which implies the market\u0027s flourishing. BTC futures and perpetual options historical open interest in the last 30 days, chart from 9pm EST, Dec. 17. Source: tokeninsight.com and skew.com Moreover, let’s think about two vital indicators: funding rates and implied volatility. We have explained the meanings of them in the last market blog (Phoney Silence? Weekly Market Review by TokenInsight), so we will unscramble these indicators directly. Funding rates of BTC in the last 90 days, chart from 9pm EST, Dec. 17. Source: tokeninsight.com Compared with last week, the funding rate turns positive with a high rise, especially for the coin-margined contract. This indicates more investors are keeping a positive view for the future of the market, at least for the future of Bitcoin. Recent implied volatility surface of BTC options, chart from 7am EST, Dec. 17, Source: gvol.io Recent volatility surfaces reveal that investors tend to buy options. Combining volatility surfaces with funding rates, it is obvious that investors tend to buy call options, which can also prove investors’ confidence for the market. However, for the long term, the volatility surface reveals that investors still hold an optimistic but cautious attitude in general. Term structure of BTC options, chart from 7am EST, Dec. 17, Source: gvol.io The last but most vital information is from implied volatility’s term structure. These curves illustrate that investors show more confidence for short-term than long-term. In general, the next year’s implied volatility is upraised, which means that we will face a more fluctuant market in the future. Highlights Picked by TokenInsight Coinbase Submitted Files to SEC to go Public On Thursday (Dec. 17, 2020), U.S. major cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase confidentially filed preliminary documents, Form S-1, with SEC, getting ready for its initial public offering.

    "title": "Steady Crypto Market: Weekly Market Review From TokenInsight",
    "detailedContent": "What we will be covering today: This week, macroeconomic factors have had a significant impact on the crypto market. Due to relatively stable market expectations, the volatility of mainstream cryptos decreased significantly this week, and the speculative activity of derivatives decreased, but the transaction activity in the spot market increased. The impact of macroeconomic factors on the crypto market is concentrated in prices and does not affect volatility. The monthly retail sales rate in July was lower than expected, resulting in a short correction in the prices of mainstream cryptos. However, the good performance of jobless claims data at the beginning of last week and good information in the crypto industry stimulated investors\u0027 expectations to rise and asset prices to return to high levels. Regulatory and security incidents have a limited impact on the performance of mainstream cryptos this week. Subscribe Join us in showcasing the cryptocurrency revolution, one newsletter at a time. Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox, along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right, millions love us!) — what are you waiting for? Volatility Declined, While Market Expectations Remained After the volatility of cryptos stagnated last week, the volatility of the crypto market declined significantly this week. As of this Friday, the historical volatility of Bitcoin has dropped to below 60, and the historical volatility of Ethereum has dropped to below 80. Judging from the annual data, the current volatility of mainstream cryptos is basically the same as that in the first half of April, which means that the market volatility may be close to the bottom, and caution should be exercised in shorting volatility strategies. From the perspective of skewness, mainstream cryptos\u0027 neutral sentiment continues. However, it is worth noting that there has been a certain decline in forward skewness. Investors seem to be lowering forward expectations, and the rise in the probability of early marginal contraction of market liquidity is the main reason. The market expectations of the options sellers have remained at a relatively high level in the near future, and there has been no major change. From the perspective of the futures market, market expectations are also relatively stable: mainstream crypto futures products in major futures exchanges (Deribit, OKEX, FTX) have maintained a significant positive premium of about 7% to 9%, and even CME, an exchange dominated by traditional market investors with conservative investment styles, has also seen a positive premium of more than 3%. Macro Factors Still Dominate the Rhythm of Market This week, regulators were more active than last week, taking frequent actions on transaction compliance, but did not have a significant impact on the crypto market. Spain\u0027s National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and the People\u0027s Bank of China have punished some exchanges for unlicensed operations, trading, publicity, and other acts. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) issued a notice warning investors not to trade cryptos on platforms that do not hold an Australian Financial Services (AFS) license and pointed out that investing in crypto derivatives trading is too risky. Some Fed officials also expressed concern about the risks of trading cryptos at this week\u0027s Fed meeting. Iran\u0027s National Tax Administration (INTA) has put forward proposals on a new legal system for crypto trading, aiming to increase fiscal revenue through exchange compliance and taxation. Regulatory action against Binance continues: Binance is banned from operating in the Netherlands for its violation of various Dutch laws, according to a statement issued by the Dutch central bank on August 18. The Dutch central bank is likely to take action against Binance, but details are not yet clear. In addition, traders seeking compensation from Binance for service disruptions during market turmoil earlier this year have received financial support to prepare for one of the largest legal battles to date against the exchange. They have filed claims totaling more than $20M dollars against the exchange and hope to unite hundreds of traders. Binance is aggressively hiring a compliance team to deal with the situation. Chief executive Zhao Changpeng said the priority was to \"recruit people with compliance and regulatory experience\". The company is also seeking regular meetings with US officials. The US Treasury is preparing guidance to help define \"crypto brokers\", which could be published as early as next week. Some practitioners in the crypto industry have welcomed the regulation. They believe that stricter regulation of cryptos may stimulate the demand for cryptos. At present, due to the fear of fraud, the lack of supervision fees has prevented some investors from using cryptos, because not all investors are willing to bear the risk of fraud, which is not protected by law. The regulatory clampdown may lead to wider adoption of cryptos, because it will strengthen people\u0027s investment. This will affect the price of cryptos in a \"positive way\". Institutions are increasingly interested in investing in cryptos and crypto-related industries. Last weekend data showed that net short positions in bitcoin futures reached their lowest level since mid-May. Traders were forced to exit short positions in bitcoin and Ethereum and began to build long positions. The clear signs of improved demand in the futures market indicate that institutional demand for cryptos is rising. This week, Wells Fargo registered a private Bitcoin fund. Tech giants are beginning to lay out or strengthen their presence in the field of cryptos: Intel bought more than 3,000 shares of Coinbase for its first investment in the field of cryptos, while Facebook\u0027s crypto division has set its sights on third-party stable currency transactions. Crypto-related companies are widely favored: Bitpanda, the European crypto trading platform, raised $263M in a new round of financing and reached a valuation of $4.1B. 5 months ago, the company was worth only $1.2B. Bitcoin miner Iris Energy is expected to list on Nasdaq in the fourth quarter of 2021. Jefferies and Barclays have become joint book runners of London-listed miner Argo Blockchain. Coinbase announced this week that it will reinvest 10% of its profits in cryptos and is already preparing to buy $500M cryptos. In addition, Coinbase has teamed up with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group to create a crypto exchange in Japan that allows customers to use accounts with Mitsubishi Bank to buy and sell cryptos. On the macro-economic front, due to the spread of the epidemic again, the economic stimulus plan and liquidity supply have continued, which is beneficial to maintaining high prices of cryptos. Affected by the epidemic, the New Zealand Reserve Bank (RBNZ) decided to cancel the interest rate hike plan this week and keep the interest rate low. As a hawkish central bank, the RBNZ\u0027s attitude shows that in order to fight the epidemic, it will not tighten liquidity for the time being. Considering that the attitude of major western countries is generally more moderate than that of the RBNZ, the liquidity tightening is expected to ease somewhat. The number of first-time US jobless claims last week was 348K, the smallest increase since the week of March 14, 2020, and the fourth consecutive week of decline, indicating that employment growth was strong last month. The minutes of this week\u0027s Federal Reserve meeting pointed out that most people believe that a proportional reduction in the purchase of residential mortgage-backed securities and treasury bonds is beneficial. The decision to reduce debt has nothing to do with the timing of interest rate hikes, and the Federal Reserve may reach the threshold for reducing the scale of debt purchases this year. Most participants pointed out that the spread of the Delta virus could temporarily delay a full economic restart. Recent inflation data have been affected by supply bottlenecks and labor shortages and are likely to be temporary. Rosengren, chairman of the Boston Federal Reserve, said he would support a reduction in bond purchases starting next month, as large-scale bond purchases are not suitable for the US. On the same day, Brad, chairman of the St Louis Fed, said he would prefer to reduce the scale of bond purchases in the first quarter of 2022. The Fed is expected to allow the balance sheet to be reduced after the reduction is completed, allowing market pricing to control long-term credit markets. The fourth quarter of 2022 is a reasonable time to raise interest rates. Although the Fed Taper (tightening liquidity) is expected to advance, the first phase of measures to reduce debt-based, only to tighten marginal liquidity, the near-term impact on asset prices is small. However, as the economy recovers, future scale reductions and even interest rate hikes will have a significant impact on crypto prices. Next week, PMI data from major developed countries, consumer confidence index, and the new issue of US jobless claims will be released one by one, further judgment on macroeconomic trends will become the core factor affecting the expectations of crypto investors, and next week\u0027s monthly derivatives delivery will also push up market volatility together with macro factors.

As of 11:00 on May 21, the historical volatility of Bitcoin perpetual contracts in the crypto asset market has risen to 181.3, and that of Ethereum has reached an \"horrific\" 252.86, which have separated obviously from the historical volatility of spot index prices, rare in the history of crypto assets. Ethereum spot index price and perpetual contract historical volatility, source: gvol.io The market has stabilized from the temporary panic, as of 14:00 on May 21, the price of Bitcoin dropped to $29,000 and was stable near $40,000, and Ethereum has also successfully maintained at $2,500, however, a large number of contract liquidations, selling pressure caused by panic selling, DeFi serial liquidation and other information still make investors feel lingering. Even the \"industry giant V\" Justin Sun has even been liquidated away from his 600,000 ETH position; it can be said that May 19 is the \"darkest time\" in this bull market in the crypto asset market.

Is There Widespread Panic in the Market? Indeed, there was a panic in the market, but this time it did not trigger a \"widespread panic.\" Speculators placed a great amount of bets on perpetual, and the market performance often reflects the mood of speculators. In terms of trading volume, the market trading volume is basically the same as the large-scale fluctuations at the end of February: taking Bitcoin as an example, the market perpetual volume on February 23 and 24 reached more than $370 billion, and this time the perpetual trading volume was around $320 billion, not the highest this year. The possible reason is that the market has established expectations of a decline in a long-term sideways market. Therefore, the scale of panic selling is relatively limited in this decline. The greater possibility for the growing trading volume is perpetual liquidation. Of course, the sell-off is not non-existent: as of 15:00 on May 21, Bitcoin perpetual holdings fell to $15.6 billion, a 29.54% drop compared to last week, slightly higher than the weekly price fluctuations of around 21%. It shows that some investors have chosen to liquidate their positions in a highly volatile market, but overall, the decline in market positions has not been significant, and has not reached the standard of \"significant impact\". Changes in the trading volume of Bitcoin perpetual in the past 90 days, as of 15:00 on May 21, source: tokeninsight.com On the other hand, the amount of liquidation confirms the view of \"limited panic\". Before the large-scale liquidation on May 19, the scale of liquidation caused by the sharp drop on April 17 was actually relatively larger: Bitcoin fell from around $62,000 to $55,000. The long and short sides combined liquidation exceeds $10 billion. At this time, expectations for a decline have been established; there is consensus that there will be a callback in the market in mid-year. Due to the early release of pressure, the liquidation volume on May 19 was less than $8.6 billion, which largely avoided the liquidity crisis and even further chain reactions caused by excessive market liquidation. Changes in the daily settlement amount of perpetual in the whole market in the past 90 days, source: bybt.com In the spot market, there was the second peak on May 19th since the beginning of January: the day after the price fell, the transaction volume of Bitcoin reached $45.64 billion, and the spot transaction volume of all-market tokens reached $232.3 billion. There seems to be a massive sale, but it is not. While a large number of individual investors choose to sell digital assets, some European and American investment institutions and individual investors who intend to \"buy the dip\". The large number of buying and selling operations that day pushed up the trading volume, and of course it also dysfunctioned exchanges: Binance and Coinbase both experienced varying degrees of trading congestion and downtime due to excessive data processing and liquidation. However, with the combined efforts of liquidity providers, market makers, quantitative hedge funds, exchanges, and even individual investors, the liquidity of the digital asset market has not been significantly affected. Changes in the trading volume of the digital asset spot market in the past 90 days, source: tokeninsight.com From the perspective of capital inflow/outflow, after the 19th, the capital in mainstream digital asset markets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum is actually in a state of inflow. Within 24 hours, the inflow of funds in the Bitcoin market reached $250 million, and Ethereum reached $330 million. On the whole, the outflow of Bitcoin funds in the past month, the inflows of the high-yield digital asset market such as Ethereum has not changed, and the market value of Bitcoin still remains below 45%. Cash net inflows/net outflows of Bitcoin and Ethereum in the past 30 days, source: tokeninsight.com What Is FOMO? The inflow and outflow of funds in different exchanges within 24 hours also revealed the regional nature of panic and selling. On Binance, Huobi, OKEx and other exchanges, the Bitcoin market is in a state of outflow or close to outflow; the sell-off is dominated by small amounts. A large number of users of the three exchanges are from East Asia, and Huobi and OKEx exchanges account for the majority. Changes in Bitcoin market capital flow on Binance, Huobi, and OKEx exchanges in the past 24 hours, source: tokeninsight.com On the contrary, Coinbase, FTX, and Bitstamp exchanges where European and American investors are concentrated, all investors are buying Bitcoin, and the net inflow of funds is very obvious. On the Ethereum market, most mainstream exchanges have shown a significant inflow of funds except Binance. It is the same as the past 30 days. The above information shows that the selling pressure in the Bitcoin market is likely to come from East Asia, and the impact on Ethereum is small. There has been an abnormal movement in the Bitcoin market. What happened in East Asia? Changes in Bitcoin market capital flow on Coinbase, FTX, and Bitstamp in the past 24 hours, source: tokeninsight.com The outflow of funds in the Bitcoin market of East Asia exchanges in the past 30 days/The inflow of funds in the Bitcoin market of exchanges in Europe and the United States in the past 30 days, source: tokeninsight.com What Happened Around May 19th? It is easy to find that the crowds of panic selling mainly come from East Asia. Let us sort out the background of the incident: Since the bull market began, one of the largest stock markets in Asia has seen a large amount of net outflows. Among them, the large outflow of funds from public funds has continued, with an average daily outflow of $2.44 billion. The large number of fund redemptions from the beginning of the year may be an important influencing factor. Where did the money go? In the past month, Bitcoin on the Binance exchange has received approximately $83 billion, while Huobi and OKEx have received nearly $30 billion. It is just Bitcoin. If you calculate the derivatives market, the amount of funds inflows in the entire digital asset market is surprisingly amazing, of which a large amount of funds inflows come from East Asia. In contrast, since the beginning of this year, the amount of funds raised within the stock market has plummeted: From the closure of mining in Inner Mongolia, to the bank\u0027s warning that digital asset transactions will be restricted and the industry association issuing a document requiring restrictions on digital asset transactions, the darkest moment on May 19 may have been brewing for a long time. As for why the digital asset market is suddenly \"regulated\", the changes in the traditional market may give us some clues. After Darkness: The Market Is Still in a High-Risk Phase It is true that on May 19, the digital asset market as a whole was not severely hit. However, as the Fed considers the impact of factors such as stopping QE, raising rates, and high inflation, the funds flowing into the digital asset market may gradually flow out in the future, and even pierce the bubble and end the bull market under the influence of certain major events. But it is still too early to announce the end of the bull market . However, the current volatility gap continues to be positive and has expanded, indicating that high volatility and downward trends are still in the process; considering the predictive effect of the volatility gap on market performance, the digital asset market has a high risk situation in the coming days. Market confidence needs time to recover; and from the expectations of professional investors, the time required for the market to return to the normal level during the bull market (2 trillion US dollars in market cap) may take longer than expected. Risk expectations and control will become the core themes of investors in recent days and even weeks.

    "title": "How Regulations May Affect the Mining Industry: A Data Perspective by IntoTheBlock",
    "detailedContent": "Every week, IntoTheBlock brings you on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. How Regulations May Affect the Mining Industry During this past week BTC prices have recorded a significant positive rise in price, despite the unclear regulatory outcomes in the U.S. Congress. In this article we will explore the potential path ahead for Bitcoin analyzing on-chain data. Moreover, we will assess the coming one trillion U.S. infrastructure deal, its implications on crypto and the direct effects it could have over the U.S. mining industry. This past week the crypto market has been experiencing a rise in price, BTC surpassed the $43K noted resistance. Generally led by a continued bull run from the past couple weeks, BTC price currently sits around $46K and IntoTheBlock’s In and Out of the Money Around Price (IOMAP) indicator marks the $49K point as the next spot where high volume of transactions were registered on-chain. As of Aug. 11, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin Financial metrics The IOMAP reveals that 178.31k addresses had previously bought approximately 433.53k Bitcoin at a price around $43,000. Due to the large buying activity around this area, there is expected to be strong support from new buyers and current holders. On the other hand, there is strong resistance around $50,000. The high amount of volume that was previously bought there (289.49k BTC) is expected to create selling pressure as many holders tend to look to sell positions at a break-even level. On Tuesday, the U.S. Senate gave an uncommon bipartisan approval to the $1Trillion infrastructure bill, intended to rebuild the country’s roads, bridges, airports and waterways, one of President Biden’s top priorities in agenda. The bill with great approval of The Senate, having a voting count of 69 to 30, now moves onto the House of Representatives where they will be discussing its implications in order to take a final vote on it. Senator Portman, originally introduced the provision in the infrastructure bill. This bill gives U.S. crypto entities new regulations. The bill requires that all operating U.S. crypto broker entities report transaction data to the IRS. The problem is that the specific definition for crypto “brokers” was not included in the provision. Without this clear definition, anyone operating a mining operation, staking on a proof of stake protocol or even developers creating cryptocurrencies may fit under these new regulations. Senator Portman addressed these concerns, stating that language in the bill should not be interpreted this broadly and that work should be done to clarify the exemption of miners and stakers. A group of senators in between them Cynthia Lummis introduced a new amendment last Wednesday night, in which clear clarification was given that only trading desks or entities with a similar function will be in the obligation to follow this reporting regulations. Even though this amendment was introduced last Wednesday the Senate voted in favor of passing the deal without any amendments being done; meaning no changes will be introduced to the provision and now is up to the House of Representatives to decide whether or not to continue with the deal. At IntoTheBlock we have been monitoring some indicators regarding this new regulation\u0027s effects. Particularly, this is likely to have a significant impact on the mining industry, which has been growing within the U.S. following China’s crackdown. The Hash Rate is the total speed at which mining machines are operating to solve the mathematical puzzle that validates transactions in a block. This indicator shown below is the estimated aggregate computational power (measured in Terahash per second) provided by miners to operate a given network. As of Aug. 10, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s mining indicators Since its May high of 188.04m TH/s the mining industry was seen heavily affected by the China mining ban recording a low of 62.03m TH/s on June 27. Many mining activity immigrated to the U.S, specifically to the state of Texas. This makes the current legislation discussion of prime importance to the mining sector, as miners would fit under the new “brokers” definition and would have to be regulated as such. The hash rate indicator has recorded a slow but steady recovery, and continues to show positive signs regardless of the current discussion surring mining in the U.S. congress. On the other hand, Miner Reserves point to signs of concern.The miner reserves indicator shows the aggregate balances of addresses belonging to mining pools. Typically having correlation with the hash rate indicator during the May highs and the China ban. The indicator showed a clear divergence last week when the largest yearly drop in miner reserves took place. As of Aug. 10, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s mining indicators Recording a high reserve of 2.12 million BTC on May 20th, after being impacted by the massive sell off the miners reserves now hold 1.97 million BTC, representing a decrease of -7.08%. This suggests that miners could be anticipating headwinds in the coming months as crypto legislation in the infrastructure bill is finalized. Therefore, the decrease in miner reserves could be related to American miners selling, taking precautions against potentially stringent regulation. The hash rate distribution indicator shows the concentration of hash rate by mining pools. During the China ban, pools created from Chinese entities were seen heavily affected, impacting their presence in the global hash rate distribution. As of Aug. 10, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s mining indicators During the beginning of May before the China ban implementations, the huobi.pool had a 5.03% of the total hash rate distribution and was mining about 10 blocks per day. Currently after most miners were thrown away from China the pool has a 2.63% of the total hash rate distribution, mining about 5 blocks per day. In the same way Chinese pools have decreased their presence in the total hash rate distribution, a now-significant share of unknown miners pools keep growing. Having many miners being relocated in Texas makes again the future of the industry unstable, which could lead to similar outcomes in the U.S. if regulatory clarity is not provided properly. While it is clear that implementing the infrastructure deal without any new amendments to clarify the cryptocurrency regulations could be a setback, it is important to acknowledge how far the industry has come in just a little over 12 years. During this year the cryptocurrency market cap managed to reach two trillion dollars during the month of April. New legislation is being brought up in Washington in order to clarify and bring clarity into the complex nascent industry.

    "title": "Key Metrics Pointing to Where Crypto May Be Heading Next: A Data Perspective by IntoTheBlock",
    "detailedContent": "Every week, IntoTheBlock brings you on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. Key Metrics Pointing to Where Crypto May Be Heading Next Crypto markets have traded within a narrow range the past few weeks, following the precipitous crash in mid-May. As market participants struggle to take the lead in either direction, news and blockchain indicators may provide valuable insights into what is likely to come next for the crypto space. In terms of news, probably the most relevant recent occurrence is the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) clarification that it will not be banning crypto trading. It had been rumored for multiple months that the RBI would be making it difficult for both institutions and individuals to access crypto and they have cleared up that will not be the case. Following the recent crackdown in China, this comes as a relief for the crypto market. In other news, Google has reversed its stance on advertising from crypto exchanges and wallets. Although crypto entities looking to advertise on Google will still need to be registered with the financial regulators FinCEN, this is a step forward from banning all crypto-related ads in June 2018. Both of these news signal positive developments for crypto. Similarly, on-chain data points to bullish activity following the crash. By looking at the variations in profitability, we are able to identify that buying activity is taking place. The Historical In/Out of the Money (HIOM) does just this, breaking down the number of addresses profiting over time. As of June 2, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin financial metrics Comparing Bitcoin versus ten days ago when it traded slightly higher, we observe two interesting patterns. First, the number of addresses in the money (making profits) is 900k greater, even though the price is currently lower. This points to a large number of holders taking the crash to $30,000 as an opportunity to buy and lower their average costs, thus making them profitable as prices rebounded. Second, the number of addresses out of the money decreased by nearly one million. Though some of these averaged down their entry price, it is also likely that many panic sold, realizing their losses and no longer being considered by the HIOM. This marks the transition in Bitcoin holding from short-term speculators into longer-term investors. The pattern is apparent when looking at the decrease in addresses holding for less than a month, classified as traders by IntoTheBlock. As of June 2, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin ownership metrics The decrease in short-term trading comes as investors become uncertain about where Bitcoin may be heading next in the near-term. Using data on addresses’ profitability we can also determine points of support and resistance for Bitcoin’s trajectory. Addresses’ profitability directly impacts buy and sell orders set by investors. Using on-chain data, IntoTheBlock’s In/Out of the Money Around Price (IOMAP) groups clusters of addresses depending on whether they are profitable (in the money) or losing money (out of the money), at least on paper. The largest clusters of addresses represent at which price the most volume of Bitcoin had previously been bought, and directly influences near-term support and resistance levels. As of June 2, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin financial metrics The IOMAP reveals that 1 million addresses had previously bought approximately 570K Bitcoin at a price around $37,000. Due to the large buying activity around this area, there is expected to be strong support from new buyers and current holders. Were this level to fail, then a drop to $34,000 is likely. On the other hand, there is strong resistance just below $40,000. The high amount of volume that was previously bought there (320K BTC) is expected to create selling pressure as many holders tend to look to sell positions at a break-even level. Moreover, if buyers are able to get Bitcoin beyond this range, a move to $43,000 seems probable as there appears to be little resistance in between. Due to the high concentration of volume currently near price, it is likely that price may continue range-bound, unless there is a major catalyst in either direction. Finally, it is probable that a breakout in either direction for Bitcoin will lead the rest of the crypto markets along. As of June 2, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Ethereum financial metrics This is the case as correlations to Bitcoin have been increasing across the board. In Ether’s case, the correlation with Bitcoin is back to 0.9, pointing to a strong positive relationship between the two, after being negatively correlated for a short period of time. Overall, crypto is at a critical point where people debate whether or not the bull market is over. With positive news and buying activity picking up momentum, it is possible that the worst may be behind us. However, it is too early to discount a move lower if Bitcoin prices drop below $36,000, which would drag the rest of the market along with it.

    "detailedContent": "Oracles play a uniquely important role in the crypto world, particularly in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space — in simplest terms, an oracle is the messenger that brings real-world data to smart contracts. CoinMarketCap, the world’s leading source for digital asset market data in the rapidly growing crypto space, has partnered with DIA to provide CMC data as an oracle. DIA is an ecosystem for open-source financial data, aiming to provide a reliable bridge between off-chain data and smart contracts. ‍Oracles provide fuel that gives smart contracts the data that they need to execute: the fuel of information. Through DIA, CMC’s digital asset market data — also accessible via an API — will now be available through the DIA platform as an oracle, providing yet another gateway to bring CMC data feeds directly to smart contracts. As the DeFi space experienced wild growth through the “DeFi summer wave,” the market’s need for accurate and timely data has only grown. Beyond APIs, oracles are needed more than ever to provide smart contracts with the relevant price data. CoinMarketCap’s oracle will be able to provide data for DeFi applications ranging from lending protocols to management dashboards, all of which will benefit from access to CMC’s accurate data. DIA will initially include CoinMarketCap’s top 50 crypto assets, as well as the top 25 DeFi assets. DIA has the option for its users to customize the setup of the oracle by increasing the data frequency, as well as change the breadth and depth of asset data as needed. The CoinMarketCap data oracle can be easily accessed by visiting the DIA documentation here, and following the implementation guide.",

    "detailedContent": "Every week, IntoTheBlock brings you on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. Bitcoin\u0027s Price Recovers as Exchange Outflows Spike During these past weeks the crypto market has experienced market changing events. Several tech companies started looking deeply into the blockchain arena, and Google loosening measures for crypto platforms to advertise on their search engine. Between these and the anticipation of Ethereum’s hard fork upgrade, prices of several tokens rose and retested levels not seen since May. In this article we are going to explore several indicators that reflect and may have been linked to the recent momentum in crypto markets, specifically in Bitcoin. As of Aug. 3, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s capital markets insights The price performance indicator clearly shows the market awakening from what many were calling a bear market. There are several other indicators that clearly show patterns that reflect this change in sentiment, such as flows of crypto in and out of exchanges. The exchange analytics on IntoTheBlock provide an overview of on-chain transfers to and from centralized exchanges. This allows users to see how many tokens are being transferred to and from the exchanges selected. This also provides insights into the market sentiment by providing an idea of how traders are allocating their holdings. The Net Flows indicator highlights the total sum of traders sending money in and out of exchanges. The indicator shows the sum of tokens received minus tokens leaving exchanges. On the indicator negative values will represent the excess of outflows relative to inflows, while positive values represent the greater amounts of inflows into exchanges. As of Aug. 3, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin exchange metrics This indicator gives insights into the market positioning. People withdrawing tokens from exchanges are probably looking to hold their tokens into the future, and looking for higher safety or yield on top of their crypto-assets. For instance, users may prefer to store their holdings in cold wallet storage, while others prefer to lend out their holdings through different centralized or decentralized lending platforms to earn interest. Whereas people sending tokens to exchanges are probably looking into trading the tokens and mostly taking profits, in which we usually see negative price fluctuations. During the recent price fluctuations on July 28th 2021 the indicator recorded a low point in which 32.98K BTC left the exchanges addresses. Tokens leaving exchanges pass onto an illiquid trading state, the higher this illiquid state the more demand there will be for the liquid trading tokens. Liquid trending tokens are categorized as the ones sitting on exchanges. The more people are withdrawing their tokens from exchanges the less available liquid tokens there are to buy. The outflow volume indicator shows the amount of tokens leaving exchanges, in this case BTC. This is helpful to track big token withdrawals and try to anticipate market volatility. As of Aug. 3, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin exchange metrics During this recent price breakthrough the indicator showed a clear correlation between price and the outflow volume. Using IntoTheBlock’s data for the month of July we obtain a 30-day correlation of 0.33 between Bitcoin’s outflow volume and its price, suggesting a moderately high positive relationship between the two. While keeping track of the exchange analytics area is important, the on-chain transaction activity is equally as significant. The transaction volume indicator allows us to see spikes of on-chain activity which usually tend to come hand in hand with price fluctuations. As of Aug. 3, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin network metrics During the recent break-out the indicator showed a clear relation of the on-chain recorded transactions and the price fluctuation. This is important to keep into account since high transaction volume activity together with an increase in price are typically signs that represent strength and health in the market. During the last price fluctuations the indicator recorded a significant spike on the transaction volume activity. Clear evidence is shown of the relation and connection of different sectors of the industry to price fluctuations. It can be seen how specific indicators showed signs of confidence during the market momentum experienced recently. Keeping track of the indicators over time helps spot reversals and break-outs.
