    "title": "AI-Assisted Exploits: Say Hello to the New Crypto Nightmare",
    "detailedContent": "Ever since the groundbreaking launch of ChatGPT, AI has been all the rage. Owing to this hype, GPU and AI chip producer Nvidia was one of the best-performing stocks in Q1 2024. In crypto, meanwhile, AI tokens have been outperforming Bitcoin, with some names – like Akash Network (AKT) and Bittensor (TAO) delivering returns many times the growth of BTC over the past year. Undoubtedly, the advent of AI and large language models (LLM) has been nothing short of revolutionary. They’ve already transformed nearly every industry, from healthcare to finance, injecting efficiency into processes and speeding up tedious manual tasks. In the blockchain space, we’re also increasingly seeing the use of AI. From DePIN to data oracles, AI is becoming an integral part of the decentralized ecosystem. For example, data oracle platform Oraichain connects AI and machine learning functionalities with decentralized applications and smart contracts. The Emerging Risks of AI AI brings a raft of advantages to blockchain – there are clear synergies here. But behind this shiny veneer, dangers are lurking. A space that is already prone to hacks and exploits, the web3 ecosystem faces additional vulnerabilities when artificial intelligence enters the picture. This is primarily because AI adds a layer of sophistication to existing attack vectors, acting as an additional tool in the would-be fraudster’s toolbox. And so it’s another bullet to dodge for investors navigating this exciting, but risk-fraught space. For example, machine learning algorithms can be used to analyze investor behavior patterns or identify vulnerabilities in code or security systems. Then, AI automation can facilitate the execution of a lightning-fast, sophisticated attack. Warnings abound with regards to the growing threat of cyber attacks fuelled by machine learning. ChatGPT and the Flaws of AI-Generated Code The other concern is the increasingly prevalent use of LLMs like ChatGPT to write the underlying blockchain code. This obviously saves huge amounts of time between the idea stage and bringing a protocol to market, but is this code as secure from potential attacks? Unlikely, according to blockchain security firm CertiK, which warned last year that ChatGPT-built code “may fail miserably when attackers start coming” due to various flaws. Key among these is its apparent inability to pick up logical code bugs the same way a human can. As a result, jailbreak attacks are a prominent threat to large language models. These attacks exploit loopholes in AI’s programming to produce responses that bypass its ethical safeguards. In crypto, this could allow attackers to trick AI into generating malicious smart contracts or gaining unlawful access to encryption keys, for example. Already, we’re seeing attackers turning to AI for their exploits. Microsoft recently warned that North Korean cyber actors have started using AI to increase the efficiency of their operations, for example, while finance firms have been warned to increase their security in preparation for AI-driven attacks. And then, of course, AI is getting increasingly good at impersonating us, humans. It’s learning to get past humanity checks and fool people into believing that they’re interacting with another human being. Recently, Warren Buffett was so disturbed by a deepfake that looked, moved, talked and dressed exactly like him, that he spent a large chunk of Berkshire Hathaway\u0027s annual general meeting lamenting the dangers of AI technology, comparing it to nuclear weapons. This could become increasingly problematic in the web3 world, which is already full of dubious social media interactions and fake Discord groups. Protecting Against Emerging Threats To protect against these increasingly sophisticated attacks, the blockchain industry – just like the rest of the world – should start with rigorous security audits – something every DeFi protocol should be regularly implementing anyway. Today, these audits must include a specific focus on AI systems, while more sophisticated encryption methods can help protect smart contracts from AI-powered cyberattacks. Redundancy and backup controls also play an increasingly important role in ensuring there is always the option to manually shut down AI systems if suspicious activity is detected. But while AI poses new threats, it also potentially offers solutions. This includes the use of machine learning to create more robust security systems, for example for fraud detection and prevention. AI’s ability to quickly trawl through large amounts of data far exceeds anything humans can do. Meanwhile, the IRS is already using AI to prevent tax evasion. Its use cases are truly limitless. Regulation for a Digital World While systems are important, regulators also have a key role to play in ensuring that legislative frameworks are fit for purpose in a world where artificial intelligence is gaining prominence. The good news is that we’re already seeing discussions across the globe about how to approach this novel technology. From India to the UK, governments are concerned about potential risks and looking for solutions. But regulators must move faster because AI is developing at lightning speed. Policy, meanwhile, appears to be lagging behind. The EU AI Act, for example, took nearly three years from proposal to implementation. Governments and regulators can’t afford to take their time when it comes to new technologies like AI or blockchain – we need legislative frameworks now to protect users. AI is perhaps the most exciting technological development we have seen in decades which has turned every industry on its head, including blockchain. However, as we integrate ChatGPT into our daily lives or get excited about a new AI token, it’s important to be mindful of the potential risks. Focusing on solutions to prevent these risks from materializing is the only way to avoid potentially devastating negative consequences.

    "title": "Bitcoin Runes: Is This Crypto’s Next Big Trend",
    "detailedContent": "Bitcoin, the world\u0027s first and most valuable cryptocurrency, is experiencing a renaissance. The launch of token standards on this venerable blockchain is nothing short of monumental, marking a new era of innovation and expansion. From the continued growth of Ordinals to the stagnation of BRC-20 tokens and the sudden surge of Runes, the Bitcoin ecosystem is evolving at breakneck speed. The significance of these developments cannot be overstated. For the first time, Bitcoin is moving beyond its role as a store of value and medium of exchange to become a platform for creative expression and complex financial instruments. The iterations are happening fast and furious, with each new standard building upon the successes and failures of its predecessors. Let’s take Ordinals, for example. Ordinals’ Meteoric Rise Launched in January 2023, this protocol allows users to inscribe satoshis (the smallest unit of Bitcoin) with unique content, creating NFTs native to the Bitcoin blockchain. The response was immediate and overwhelming, with social activity and engagement soaring to unprecedented heights. According to data from LunarCrush, interactions with Ordinals-related content increased by an astonishing 6,377.6% in the months following the launch to today. Number of social interactions in the last year for keywords surrounding, “Ordinals” on LunarCrush.com But High Fees Leave Some Concerned While the high fees associated with Ordinals caused some concern within the Bitcoin-only community, the protocol continues to gain traction. As more users discover the potential of NFTs on Bitcoin, the demand for Ordinals is likely to grow, even as the community works to address the fee issue. On the other hand, BRC-20 tokens, introduced in February 2023, have seen a flattening of interest. Designed to create a standard for fungible tokens on Bitcoin, BRC-20 aimed to be cheaper, faster, and more accessible than Ordinals, with the added bonus of programmability. However, data from LunarCrush suggests that engagement with BRC-20 content has stagnated, with the trendline of a number of social interactions essentially flat over the last 3-months. Number of social interactions in the last 3 months for keywords surrounding, “BRC-20” on LunarCrush.com But the real game-changer is Runes. Runes: The Token Standard That Could Rule Them All Introduced as an idea by Casey Rodarmor in September 2023, Runes is set to launch at the Bitcoin halving in 2024. This token standard combines the best of Ordinals and BRC-20 while adding its own unique twist. Unlike Ordinals, which allows for the creation of NFTs, Runes is designed specifically for the launch of fungible tokens on Bitcoin. The key innovation of Runes is its use of \"edicts\" - small, lightweight transactions that can be used to transfer ownership of tokens without clogging up the Bitcoin network. This allows for faster, cheaper, and more efficient token transfers, opening up new possibilities for creators and collectors alike. And the market has taken notice. Runes Engagement Dwarfs Ordinals and BRC-20 Even though Runes hasn\u0027t officially launched yet, social activity and engagement around the project are already surging. LunarCrush data shows posts receiving interactions with Runes-related content reaching as high as 8 million interactions in 1 day in the second week of April, far outpacing both Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens. Number of social interactions in the last 3 months for keywords surrounding, “Runes” on LunarCrush.com Innovation, Creativity, and Decentralization for All So what does all this mean for the future of Bitcoin? In short, it means that the king of cryptocurrencies is far from dead. Despite its age and purported limitations, Bitcoin is proving to be a hotbed of innovation and creativity. The success of token standards like Ordinals and the anticipated launch of Runes demonstrate that there is a real demand for expanding the capabilities of this blockchain, even as BRC-20 tokens struggle to maintain momentum. Of course, there are challenges to overcome. As more people flock to use Bitcoin for purposes beyond simple value transfer, the cost of utilizing its block space is bound to increase. But this is a natural consequence of Bitcoin\u0027s success and one that can be managed through the development of layer 2 solutions like the Stacks blockchain. For entrepreneurs and builders in the space, the message is clear: now is the time to get involved. The launch of token standards on Bitcoin has opened up a world of possibilities, from creating and trading unique digital assets to building complex Dapps. And with the rise of Runes showing no signs of slowing down, the future looks bright indeed. But perhaps the most exciting aspect of all this is what it means for the average person. Token standards on Bitcoin are not just for the tech-savvy or the financially privileged. They are for everyone - whether you\u0027re an artist looking to monetize your digital creations, a collector searching for the next big thing, or simply someone who believes in the power of decentralization. In conclusion, the evolution of token standards on Bitcoin is a testament to the resilience and adaptability of this groundbreaking technology. From the continued growth of Ordinals to the stagnation of BRC-20 tokens and the anticipated launch of Runes, each iteration has brought us closer to realizing the full potential of Bitcoin as a platform for innovation and creativity. So let us embrace this new era with open arms and open minds. Let us explore the possibilities and push the boundaries of what\u0027s possible. And most importantly, let us remember that Bitcoin belongs to all of us - not just the early adopters or the tech elite, but everyone who believes in the power of decentralization and the potential of a better future. The rise of Runes is just the beginning. The future of Bitcoin is bright, and it\u0027s ours for the taking.

    "title": "It\u0027s Not Unicorns, It\u0027s Local Geniuses - Web3\u0027s Quiet Revolution in the Global South",
    "detailedContent": "One of the most often repeated mantras in web3 is its promise to “bank the unbanked.” It’s a promise to offer digital services to millions of people who haven’t been served by web3’s brick-and-mortar counterparts — albeit in a decentralized and individually empowering way. This is especially relevant when we’re talking about the Global South: countries in Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. But, can we say that this promise has been little more than an altruistic narrative for the industry? Web3 is part of a broader effort to bridge the \"technological gap\" that exists in these regions. This initiative begins with establishing the necessary infrastructure and education. Ultimately, the success of web3 in the Global South relies on supporting local developers and their projects. Exploring Tangible Impact – Real Use Cases for Web3 Many countries in the Global South face limitations with traditional systems and infrastructure, but web3 and decentralized technologies offer innovative solutions to longstanding challenges in areas like finance, healthcare, and supply chains. Web3 enthusiasts in these regions are leveraging blockchain to create more inclusive and equitable systems tailored to local needs. For example, DeFi projects like Wala and AZA Finance are improving access to financial services in Africa by providing low-cost banking, lending, and cross-border payments. The Iris Network uses blockchain for secure digital identities, helping underserved populations access essential resources like healthcare more easily. Blockchain also enhances transparency and record-keeping for healthcare providers. In industries plagued by opacity and exploitation, like agriculture and manufacturing, blockchain ensures product traceability and ethical sourcing. Web3 governance models enable direct community participation in decision-making, empowering marginalized groups. The Importance of Web3 Education One explanation for this boom is that physical infrastructure projects that provide internet access across these regions are common and well-funded. Internet penetration has been on the rise in these regions with African countries like Nigeria leading the way with the largest number of new users. But infrastructure is only half of the equation. The goal of sharing the benefits of internet connectivity goes hand in hand with education around its use cases and how these novel technologies can improve quality of life. Web3 education should be a fundamental part of these efforts. A major barrier to web3 growth in the Global South has been limited access to quality developer education. To tackle this, an increasing number of protocols are expanding their presence in these regions. Their aim is to provide an environment where aspiring developers can learn web3 skills and advance their expertise without obstacles. By investing in educational resources and supportive communities, these initiatives hope to cultivate the next generation of web3 talent from the Global South. On the Ground Stories The web3 ecosystem in Africa is rapidly expanding, driven by amazing communities tirelessly supporting developer growth. Organizations like DLT Africa provide cohort-based learning focused on full-stack development and building projects for real-world use cases. HER DAO and Web3Ladies concentrate on empowering women in web3 by equipping them with relevant blockchain skills. There are a growing number of events especially event models that enable a more conducive environment for developers to learn, explore and excel in blockchain. A great example of this is Web3Bridge, a program created in 2019 to train Web3 developers in Africa. They regularly partner with leading Web3 projects to onboard local developers, most recently partnering with Cartesi for a masterclass in Lagos. The team led an educational effort where participants in a web3 Masterclass developed all kinds of projects using the Cartesi tech stack for 4 weeks. These initiatives reflect the region\u0027s determination to foster web3 talent despite challenges. As more projects invest in educational resources and local dev communities, it unlocks a wave of new opportunities. Africa\u0027s web3 future is bright, limited only by the imagination of its rising developer force. By prioritizing hands-on training tailored to real-world applications, these communities nurture expertise and drive innovation across DeFi, identity management, supply chains, and beyond. Their efforts ensure the Global South can contribute to and benefit from web3\u0027s transformative potential.

    "title": "Solving IoT\u0027s Fragmentation: The Vision for a Seamless, Interconnected World",
    "detailedContent": "In the rapidly evolving landscape of the Internet of Things (IoT), the promise of a seamlessly interconnected world is still just over the horizon, obscured by the dense fog of technological fragmentation. As we stand at the brink of a truly connected future, the proliferation of competing connectivity standards—LoRaWAN, Cellular, close range, like Bluetooth, among others—has resulted in a fragmented ecosystem that complicates the integration of IoT devices into a cohesive network. This fragmentation not only stifles innovation but also hampers the growth of the IoT industry, leaving consumers and businesses grappling with incompatible devices and unfulfilled potential. At the heart of this challenge lies a simple yet profound dilemma: the myriad of connectivity protocols means that a device designed for one protocol may be entirely incompatible with another. This incompatibility issue is emblematic of the current state of IoT, where the vision of a unified network of interconnected devices remains elusive. Most centralized telecoms focus on one protocol like cellular, creating a fragmented space, and networks like Helium offer only LoRaWAN. Therefore, clients find themselves juggling multiple apps and networks to build a coherent IoT solution. Looking ahead, the market is anticipated to grow at an annual growth rate of 12.57% (CAGR 2024-2028), resulting in a remarkable market volume of US$2,227.00bn by 2028. This growth underscores a significant opportunity to transform the IoT from a fragmented collection of smart devices into a cohesive, intelligent network that enhances our daily lives. Today, devices in a “smart home” require numerous communication protocols. The smart lock operates on Bluetooth, the weather station on LoRaWAN, and the security camera on Wi-Fi. This complicates the setup process and limits the ability to create truly smart, integrated systems. This means that consumers frequently find themselves buying a device from a manufacturer that offers a proprietary solution, and getting another device to expand their IoT capabilities leads them to another manufacturer and yet another incompatible platform. But, such issues are not confined to the home. On a larger scale, cities aiming to become \"smart\" face hurdles in integrating various IoT solutions, from traffic management systems to fleet management and environmental monitoring – all due to differing communication standards. The International Data Corporation (IDC) forecasts that there will be 41.6 billion connected IoT devices by 2025, generating 79.4 zettabytes of data. While such growth is exciting, we must observe the need for interoperable frameworks and standards to manage this diversity effectively. Similarly, a report by McKinsey Global Institute on the Internet of Things\u0027 economic impact underscores interoperability as a key driver for up to 40% of the IoT\u0027s value, which can be unlocked only if devices and systems can communicate with each other. The implications of this fragmentation extend beyond mere inconvenience. For the IoT industry to realize its full potential, it must overcome the barriers imposed by this lack of standardization. The current situation hinders not just the utility and adoption of IoT devices but also the innovation that could arise from a truly interconnected ecosystem. Imagine smart cities where traffic flows are optimized in real-time or precision agriculture where every sensor and device on a vast farm can communicate seamlessly, driving efficiency and sustainability. These solarpunk dreams could become a reality, but we are a long way off. Fortunately, initiatives like the Matter project, led by the Connectivity Standards Alliance, aim to develop and promote the adoption of a secure, reliable, and seamless connectivity standard for the future of IoT in smart homes. Such efforts are crucial in moving towards an interoperable IoT ecosystem, but we need more. Amid these challenges, solutions like Chirp aim to make significant strides. Chirp proposes an innovative approach to overcome fragmentation by creating an IoT network that connects devices across various protocols under one unified ecosystem. By being protocol-agnostic, Chirp facilitates the seamless integration of diverse IoT devices, eliminating the barriers to communication among them. Such an approach not only simplifies the deployment and management of IoT devices for consumers and businesses but also catalyzes the growth of the IoT industry as a whole. Unlike other Decentralized Wireless (DeWi) networks that have joined the competition, Chirp\u0027s solution is not merely about providing an alternative networking protocol; it\u0027s about reimagining the very infrastructure of IoT connectivity. Instead of forcing devices into a one-size-fits-all model, Chirp acknowledges the diversity of IoT devices and their unique needs. This inclusivity is key to unlocking the potential of IoT, allowing devices to communicate and collaborate regardless of their native protocols. Moreover, Chirp\u0027s vision extends beyond the technical feat of protocol unification. It embodies the principle of decentralization, leveraging the collective power of device owners and users to build and maintain the network. This community-driven model fosters a sense of ownership and participation among users, democratizing access to IoT connectivity and empowering individuals to be part of a global, interconnected solution. Chirp has recently launched its testnet on the Sui blockchain, and already over 10,000 accounts have been created, nearly 300 BlackBird miners onboarded in 31 countries and over 200 cities, and 700+ IoT devices connected to the network. The simplification of deployment makes the technology more accessible and, ultimately, more impactful. However, industry-wide collaboration is essential. From device manufacturers to software developers, regulators, and users, stakeholders across the spectrum must come together to support universal standards and interoperable solutions. The industry must move away from siloed efforts and towards a shared vision of interoperability and inclusivity. The success of IoT depends not just on technological innovation but on creating an ecosystem where devices can communicate across barriers. Only then can we unlock the true potential of the Internet of Things, paving the way for a world where everything is connected seamlessly and effortlessly. As we look to the future, the path to overcoming IoT\u0027s fragmentation lies in the potential for collaboration and openness. In this journey, Chirp represents both a pioneer and a partner, inviting all stakeholders—from device manufacturers to network providers, developers, and users—to join in creating a truly interconnected world.

    "summary": "Distributed Validation Technology addresses the centralization issue in Ethereum staking, building a more resilient, secure, and decentralized ecosystem as we head into a new bull cycle.",
    "title": "The Future of Staking: Why Ethereum Needs to Embrace Distributed Validation",
    "detailedContent": "In the rapidly evolving world of blockchain and cryptocurrency, Ethereum stands at a critical juncture. The need for a more decentralized, secure, and equitable staking ecosystem has never been more apparent as the network underwent significant changes, like its transition to Proof of Stake (PoS) and the Dencun upgrade. This is where Distributed Validation Technology (DVT) can help create a more decentralized, secure, and inclusive Ethereum ecosystem. Today, the concentration of staking power among a few large entities poses significant risks to the Ethereum network, including centralization, reduced network resilience, and the potential for censorship. This centralization contradicts the decentralized ethos that Ethereum and the broader blockchain community strive to uphold. This is the most pressing challenge in the validation process and one of the most significant risks to the Ethereum network. Distributed Validation Technology (DVT), introduced by Ethereum founder Vitalik in his roadmap for the Ethereum Network, offers a solution to this challenge and brings decentralization, security, and inclusivity back to Ethereum staking. DVT was proposed as a foundational technology that redefines the architecture of Ethereum\u0027s Proof of Stake (PoS) validators. It enables a validator to operate not as a singular entity confined to one node or machine but as a cohesive unit across a constellation of nodes. This innovation allows individuals, groups, or communities of operators to power a single validator within the Ethereum ecosystem collaboratively. By embodying the validator within a network of nodes, DVT significantly enhances the validator\u0027s resilience and markedly diminishes the risk of slashing for validators who operate with integrity, irrespective of their scale. The Future of Ethereum Staking DVT’s transformative approach to staking democratizes access and makes staking more inclusive and secure for validators of all sizes. Through DVT, the Ethereum network takes a substantial leap forward in ensuring that its staking infrastructure is more resilient and universally accessible, paving the way for a more decentralized and equitable blockchain ecosystem. Furthermore, the concept of rainbow staking, recently proposed by Barnabé Monnot in an Ethereum Research blog, seeks to diversify the staking ecosystem even further by unbundling services into heavy and light layers, which aligns with the vision of distributed validation. Rainbow staking would allow for a more nuanced and flexible staking landscape, where validators can specialize in different services based on their capabilities and preferences. This specialization can lead to a more competitive and efficient network with improved service quality and innovation. Rainbow staking combined with distributed validation would significantly alleviate the current centralization risks of Ethereum staking. Leveraged Ethereum \u0026 Staking As blockchain technology evolves, Ethereum\u0027s journey toward embracing distributed validation is not merely a strategic choice but a requirement to ensure its resilience, inclusivity, and adaptability amid the emergence of networks and increased Total Value Locked (TVL). The last crypto bull market, which saw an all-time high of $108.99 billion in value locked on November 9, 2021, showcased the vast potential of economic leverage within DeFi, highlighting Ethereum\u0027s role as a foundational infrastructure for innovative financial solutions. As we head into a fresh bull run, leveraging Ethereum\u0027s security through a more resilient validation framework is imperative. In this context, DVT also enhances Ethereum\u0027s ability to mitigate risks associated with the increased leverage on its core infrastructure. The superiority of DVT lies not only in its capacity to fortify the network\u0027s security but also in its contribution to democratizing network participation, making it critical in an era where market volatility and the potential for losses are even higher. Inclusivity \u0026 Accessibility The adoption of distributed validation extends beyond technical resilience, touching on the core ethos of blockchain technology: inclusivity and accessibility. By lowering the barriers to becoming a validator, DVT fosters a sense of belonging among a broader community of stakeholders, reinforcing Ethereum\u0027s status as a public good. This inclusivity is crucial for strengthening the network\u0027s foundation and enhancing its perception globally. For example, DVT facilitates access for validators in areas plagued by power outages and economic constraints, such as Latin America and Africa. This approach broadens the network\u0027s reach and enriches it with diverse perspectives and contributions, driving innovation and resilience through collective strength. Indeed, DVT\u0027s significance will be further amplified in the regions where economic and infrastructural challenges have historically impeded participation in blockchain networks. As Ethereum continues to evolve and adapt to the changing landscape of blockchain and decentralized finance, embracing distributed validation becomes indispensable. The technical superiority of DVT, coupled with its potential to democratize access and foster inclusivity, perfectly positions Ethereum to navigate future complexities. By embracing DVT, Ethereum can solidify its role as a foundational infrastructure for the next generation of blockchain applications, ensuring its sustainability and success in the future.

    "title": "RWA Tokenization At Scale Isn’t Viable, Yet",
    "detailedContent": "Everybody is talking about real-world asset (RWA) tokenization these days, and for a good reason. RWA tokenization can finally connect the blockchain with the real world, opening up a wealth of practical applications for decentralized technology. As such, this innovative development is set to finally propel crypto into the mainstream. However, the current blockchain ecosystem isn’t quite ready to play host to this new mainstream audience. That isn’t to say that the technology isn’t ready – this is not the problem. However, there are lessons to be learned from traditional financial markets before we begin to see billions, or even trillions of real-world assets moving on-chain, primarily when it comes to security, regulation, and identity verification. Without these core principles, RWA tokenization will remain an experimental technology at best. Scaling up To achieve RWA tokenization at scale, the companies working on this must refocus their efforts. At the moment, RWA tokenization is being experimented with by a select few large institutional players. The latest news came from banking giant Citi, which brought a Wellington Management-issued private equity fund onto Avalanche’s Spruce subnet. This network was launched last April for institutions looking to test trade execution and settlement on-chain. Like other banking giants, including JP Morgan and DBS Bank, Citi has been testing the feasibility and potential applications of blockchain technology in the financial sector under Project Guardian, led by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). But while this collaboration has seen some exciting developments that hint at the potential future success of RWA tokenization, so far that’s primarily all it’s been – experiments and proofs of concept. While some real-world assets have begun moving on-chain, like US treasuries, so far this has been a small proportion of the total market cap of these asset classes. For example, the total value of tokenized treasuries was under $700 million in November 2023, according to 21.co. This is a tiny fraction of the total US treasury market size, which sits at $26 trillion, based on data from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Regulatory hurdles In order to bring the trillions of dollars currently traded in traditional stocks, equities, real estate, and more onto the blockchain we need to stop talking the talk and focus on the practical aspects of RWA tokenization. First and foremost, this means understanding how RWAs fit into the global regulatory framework. Like the rest of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, RWA tokenization faces a raft of regulatory hurdles. For example, when it comes to real estate tokenization, in theory, this should be subject to the same laws as other property investments. However, different jurisdictions have different legislations to govern real-estate transactions, making it difficult to establish a uniform framework for the global property tokenization market. Solving this fragmentation problem should be a key priority for regulators around the world. To bring tokenization into the mainstream and really reap the benefits, we need to reassess global regulatory frameworks and adapt them to the modern world of blockchain technology. We require DeFi legislation that is fit for purpose, which must encompass all of its different facets: decentralized governance, privacy, the speed of innovation, and DeFi’s global nature. With a comprehensive framework in place, we can move forward to bring RWA tokenization into the mainstream – not just onto the testnets of a select few institutional giants. Security in focus But it’s not just the outside influence of the regulators that will shape the future of RWA tokenization. The blockchain industry must also adapt in order to help trillions of dollars seamlessly transition on-chain. In part, this will depend on the scalability of the existing blockchain networks. We’re seeing a great deal of development happening in this arena, with Ethereum firmly focused on scalability across its planned developments over the coming years, which should support the expansion of RWAs on the blockchain. However, we need to see more focus on safety. Rather than simply testing the technology, we must ensure that the blockchain world meets the rigorous standards of traditional financial markets, because this is where the money will be coming from. Identity verification This means crypto can no longer afford the bad rep from the hacks and exploits that have plagued the space, resulting in another $1.7 billion in losses in 2023, according to Chainalysis. We believe this is unachievable without a certain level of compromise. As such, the DeFi ecosystem must embrace identity verification in order to minimize these risks and make large-scale RWA tokenization on-chain plausible. This identity verification process will have to be adapted to the DeFi world in order to maintain the privacy element that is a crucial part of its ethos, but there are ways to get the best of both worlds here. For example, soulbound NFTs and zk-rollups offer solutions that facilitate identity verification in an anonymous fashion, allowing users to transact in a DeFi ecosystem securely without being doxxed. This enhanced level of security is exactly what we require to facilitate the shift of trillions in mainstream capital on-chain. It will undoubtedly take time for regulatory frameworks to catch up with the huge potential of RWA tokenization, but blockchain technology is perfectly positioned to lead the way – if only we’re willing to build and maintain this bridge between digital and real-world assets.

    "title": "Crypto\u0027s Tightrope: Satisfying Speculators While Building for the Future",
    "detailedContent": "Companies are often caught in a tug-of-war between building long-term utility and catering to the immediate demands of their more speculative stakeholders. These individuals are typically looking for quick returns and are drawn to the hype around new tokens, NFT drops, and other speculative opportunities. Balancing this dynamic while maintaining a vision for sustainable growth is a challenge that every crypto company faces, including our own journey with Open Campus. Balancing Act: Utility vs. Hype The key to this balancing act lies in understanding the different motivations within your community and addressing them through a multifaceted approach: Transparent Communication: Keep your community informed about your long-term vision, upcoming developments, and how they contribute to the overall value of the project. Transparency builds trust and helps align your community\u0027s expectations with your roadmap. Engagement and Utility: Develop features and incentives that provide immediate value to holders while also contributing to the project\u0027s long-term goals. This could include staking rewards, governance participation, or access to exclusive content and events. Innovative Marketing: Use creative marketing strategies to maintain excitement and engagement around your project. This could involve collaborations, limited-edition drops, or interactive community events. Sustainable Development: Focus on building a product or platform that offers genuine utility and addresses a real need within your target market. This is the foundation upon which long-term value is built. Community Building: Foster a strong, engaged community that supports your project not just for speculative gains but for its long-term vision and impact. Community support is crucial during market downturns and can drive organic growth through word-of-mouth and social sharing. Learning from Others: Memeland and Pixelmon Expanding on this, various projects within the cryptocurrency and Web3 domain offer insightful strategies for maintaining a delicate equilibrium between short-term excitement and long-term value creation. Taking Memeland as an illustrative example, the project has adeptly broadened its ecosystem through strategic partnerships and launch of sub-collections such as Potatoz and Captainz. These strategic expansions serve a dual purpose: they not only catalyze a surge in community engagement and trading activity but also seamlessly integrate with Memeland’s overarching narrative. This enriches the project\u0027s holistic growth and enhances its utility within the broader ecosystem. In a similar vein, the gaming Web3 platform Pixelmon stands on the cusp of introducing its $MON token, a move poised to galvanize both anticipation and active participation within its community. This anticipation is not unfounded but is supported by a blend of strategic marketing initiatives and substantial advancements within their gaming platform, ensuring that stakeholders are not just spectators but active participants in the project\u0027s journey. Pixelmon\u0027s commitment to delivering gaming utility, coupled with a transparent and well-articulated roadmap, demonstrates a strategic approach aimed at nurturing a loyal supporter base while simultaneously appealing to those driven by the allure of immediate returns. Through these examples, it\u0027s evident that the key to sustaining momentum in the fast-paced crypto world lies in a project\u0027s ability to weave short-term attractions with long-term visions, thereby fostering an ecosystem that thrives on both immediate engagement and sustainable growth. At Open Campus, we\u0027ve been navigating these waters with our $EDU token while simultaneously building long-term utility through initiatives like the Open Campus ID and our creator competition. Our goal has always been to create a robust ecosystem that supports education and learning through blockchain technology, but we\u0027ve also had to ensure that $EDU remains attractive to those looking for immediate value. One strategy we\u0027ve employed is to engage our community with regular updates, transparent roadmaps, and clear communication about our long-term vision and short-term milestones. This involves a mix of marketing efforts to keep the hype alive and technical development to ensure that our platform offers genuine, lasting value. We\u0027ve also introduced utility features for $EDU holders, such as access to exclusive content, voting rights on platform decisions, and participation in our edtech accelerator programs. Moving Forward It\u0027s important to note that catering to short-term speculative interests can lead to volatility and may detract from your project\u0027s long-term objectives if not carefully managed. The speculative nature of crypto markets means that prices can be highly volatile, influenced by broader market trends, regulatory news, and community sentiment. Projects must navigate these waters carefully, ensuring that their efforts to generate hype do not overshadow or detract from their core mission and long-term utility. Balancing the immediate demands of speculative farmers with the need to build long-term utility is a complex but necessary task for any crypto company. By drawing lessons from successful projects like Memeland and Pixelmon, and through our own experiences with Open Campus, it\u0027s clear that a multi-pronged approach that combines transparent communication, community engagement, innovative marketing, and sustainable development is key to navigating this challenge. The ultimate goal is to build a project that not only satisfies the immediate desires of speculators but also stands the test of time through genuine utility and innovation.",

    "title": "The Role of AI in Turning Crypto\u0027s Decentralization Dream Into Reality",
    "detailedContent": "There is no doubt that artificial intelligence is going to change all of our lives and that it will be a force to reckon with over the coming decades. The recent news around Nvidia\u0027s revenues, which rose 265% from the previous year to reach $22.1 billion in Q4 2023, was just a small taste of the power of this incredible technology to transform all markets. Indeed, the news was a tide that lifted all AI-linked cryptocurrency projects. Tokens like SingularityNet (AGIX), Fetch.AI (FET) and Render (RNDR) surged on the news as optimism around the growth potential of AI soared. But while Nvidia is undoubtedly the biggest player in the field, AI’s impact on the decentralized finance (DeFi) space is much more than a few altcoins. AI is going to become a major part of every corner of the blockchain ecosystem and revolutionize the way DeFi functions. More than that, AI has the potential to finally help make the truly decentralized ecosystem that we have all dreamed of a reality. From efficiency to security, AI has a major role to play in building the decentralized finance ecosystem of the future and, indeed, it is perhaps the missing piece of the puzzle required to bring DeFi into the mainstream. Mainstream adoption of DeFi So how exactly will artificial intelligence enhance decentralized applications to help achieve this lofty goal? Firstly, AI can be embedded into any smart contract, enhancing their efficiency and making them more reliable. Powered by AI, smart contracts can finally facilitate truly decentralized transactions without the need for any type of intermediary. From staking to portfolio rebalancing, AI can act as a wealth manager, a trader, an adviser, or any other part of the financial ecosystem. Anything from underwriting to lending can be made more efficient with the help of machine learning and AI algorithms. On top of this, AI can transform the DeFi user experience. Imagine a DeFi ecosystem where transactions occur seamlessly. Just like a traditional investment app, the integration of AI could automate menial and time-consuming tasks, simplifying these complex processes and ultimately making the space more accessible for all types of investors. Indeed, AI\u0027s impact extends beyond DeFi into the broader financial advice market. By offering cost-effective alternatives to traditional wealth management solutions, AI democratizes access to financial services and empowers investors by freeing up time for critical decision-making processes. Democratizing data On the DeFi infrastructure side, AI will also play a critical role in data collection and market analysis. AI algorithms can efficiently analyze vast amounts of blockchain data, providing valuable insights at unprecedented speeds. AI-driven analytics can track market trends and behaviors which can, in turn, help traders, investors, and key decision-makers in the crypto space. As such, AI not only democratizes access to financial services, it also opens up decentralized access to financial data and reduces the reliance on centralized entities. Until now, we haven\u0027t been able to transition fully to decentralized data for key decisions, but AI has the power to facilitate this shift. This could have far-reaching implications for both the decentralized and physical world. Decentralized data, unencumbered by centralized control, is more accurate, timely and transparent than data available from centralized sources. AI can enhance this data to the point where it provides the most comprehensive picture of any market, be it commodities or bonds. By embedding AI into decentralized data oracles, we can eliminate the risk of data inconsistencies and the threat that this data might be tampered with. A safer DeFi ecosystem Centralized data isn’t the only DeFi risk that can be drastically reduced with the help of artificial intelligence. AI is uniquely positioned to make the DeFi space more secure for both new and existing users. AI-powered algorithms can identify potential threats and vulnerabilities in decentralized protocols and quickly deploy solutions to protect against these threats. Ultimately, this can make the entire ecosystem more secure, reducing the instances of hacks and fraud, which still plague the DeFi space, and make it more accessible to the mainstream user. Last but by no means least, artificial intelligence has applications in the management of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). AI can help automate decision-making, which, in turn, ensures transparency and fairness. This has the potential to simplify the governance of DAOs, which are central to DeFi. By making DAO governance fairer and simpler, AI can help foster a more equitable decentralized ecosystem. The potential applications of AI in crypto are truly exciting. But if there is one thing that we should be concerned about, it is the centralization of AI. Artificial intelligence is an incredible resource that has almost unlimited potential, which is both exciting and frightening. In the hands of the wrong centralized entity, it could also do a great deal of harm. AI must be a decentralized technology if it is to bring benefits to the world at large. And, in particular, in DeFi, we cannot rely on AI resources if they are centralized – this simply goes against the ethos of this space. This is the biggest battle the DeFi community will have to fight when it comes to AI – ensuring that this technology can be used to enhance decentralization, rather than destroy any hope of a truly decentralized future. - Stefan Rust is the CEO of Truflation.com, which tracks real-time data across networks, markets, and feeds to provide financial and economic data on-chain.

    "title": "Blockchain, Gaming, and Beyond: Southeast Asia’s Potential for Crypto Adoption",
    "detailedContent": "Home to over 675 million people, representing approximately 8.5% of the global population, this area ranks as the third most densely populated region in Asia, following South Asia and East Asia. Southeast Asia (SEA) is not merely embracing technological progress; it is actively working towards forging a financial landscape that is all-encompassing. Beyond the strides in technology, the region demonstrates a dedicated commitment to a broader mission — molding a more inclusive financial future that addresses the varied needs of its extensive population According to the 2023 Global Crypto Adoption Index by Chainalysis, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Thailand stand on the verge of a global crypto revolution. Presently, more than 70% of adults in Southeast Asia struggle with inadequate access to financial services, and numerous small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) grapple with significant funding shortfalls. Cryptocurrencies play a vital role in bridging these essential gaps, and fostering economic empowerment. In a region where a considerable portion of the population remains unbanked or underbanked, cryptocurrencies signify the advent of a fresh era characterized by inclusive financial accessibility. More Web2 Enterprises Need To Make Their Mark The intersection of Web2 enterprises and Southeast Asia has become a hotbed for the flourishing crypto landscape. This plays a pivotal role that established digital entities are playing in propelling the adoption and growth of cryptocurrencies in the region.Southeast Asia, with nearly 700 million residents, has one of the world’s fastest-growing populations; 480 million of them are active internet users and more are coming online. By 2040, Asia is estimated to make up half of global GDP and 40% of global consumption Many enterprises in the region are looking closely at Web3 technologies to see how they can improve their services. AirAsia has ventured into the Web3 space with a partnership with a blockchain-based loyalty platform MiL.k, encompassing services like flights, food delivery, and financial services. The airline has expressed interest in blockchain for various aspects of its operations, from ticketing to its loyalty program, indicating a potential shift towards Web3 to streamline services and enhance customer experience. In September 2023, Grab, Southeast Asia’s Uber-like super app, is working with the USDC issuer Circle to enable Web3 services for its 187 million users. In December 2023, Unstoppable Domains added 12 new partnerships including, NoNameMonster, Entorno, EndlessDomains, and DotNames, to help accelerate the mass adoption of web3 domains in South America and Southeast Asia. Leaning Into the Mainstream Accessibility of Blockchain Gaming The Southeast Asia Gaming Market is projected to grow from USD 14.80 billion in 2024 to USD 14.93 billion by 2029, with a CAGR of 0.19% during the forecast period, Southeast Asia stands prominently at the forefront of this industry. This not only stems from its massive gaming community but also its pivotal role in shaping game development, market share, and revenue generation globally. Meanwhile, gaming guilds across several countries in Southeast Asia are expected to play a key role in onboarding mainstream gamers to the Web3 gaming market. In 2020-2022, gaming guilds such as YGG demonstrated the potential of grassroots communities and DAOs in Southeast Asia, successfully onboarding hundreds of thousands of Axie Infinity users in the Philippines, and this success story has led to the birth of numerous gaming guilds in other Southeast Asian countries. Although the P2E gaming frenzy didn\u0027t last long, gaming guilds have been at the forefront of Web3 gaming culture in Southeast Asia, and they\u0027re showing signs of making another big splash with a variety of new game IPs. For example, Heroes of Mavia, developed by Skrice Studios based in Vietnam, has been working closely with Web3 gaming guilds and communities in Southeast Asia and has recently reached over 2 million downloads on the Google Play Store and App Store. Current Challenges to Adoption The region\u0027s potential for crypto growth is undeniable, but it grapples with a series of formidable hurdles that demand attention and resolution. Foremost among these challenges is the unsettling issue of regulatory uncertainty, a patchwork quilt woven with varying degrees of acceptance and caution across different countries. While some governments adopt a progressive stance, embracing the possibilities of cryptocurrency, others opt for stringent regulations or outright bans, resulting in a fractured and unpredictable environment for industry players. Adding to the complexity is the prevalent lack of consumer education and awareness surrounding cryptocurrency. A considerable portion of the population remains skeptical or uninformed about the potential benefits and risks associated with digital currencies, fostering a reluctance to embrace them as legitimate forms of digital money. Bridging this knowledge gap becomes imperative; comprehensive education and outreach initiatives are necessary to unlock the full potential of cryptocurrency adoption in the region. With the escalating demand for cryptocurrency, robust cybersecurity measures and well-crafted regulations are not just recommended but are fundamental to safeguarding the market\u0027s integrity and shielding users from fraudulent activities. As the region grapples with these challenges, overcoming them will pave the way for Southeast Asia to fully realize the transformative potential of the cryptocurrency revolution.

    "title": "The Unchained Melody of L2s",
    "detailedContent": "2023 showed us a burgeoning world of Layer 2 (L2) solutions, and with numerous companies considering launching their own L2 chains, there are no signs of this trend slowing down anytime soon. L2s are finding their own unique footing within an interoperable open-source ecosystem. With most products in the world, there are starter and advanced versions. For example, compare a one-click button Nespresso machine to a Breville barista-style espresso maker or the basic Shopify storefront creator versus the advanced version. In blockchain, this concept translates to a crucial decision: whether to deploy on an existing network or build a custom chain. When Is It Right To Build an L2? The rule of thumb for success hinges on certain qualities, such as having an established product-market fit, generating significant transaction volume, or owning a well-known intellectual property that can sustain its own chain without competing for block space. The choice is strategic. For many, launching on a shared mainnet is the prudent first step. Existing L2s, equipped with everything from stablecoins to wallet integrations, offer a ready-to-deploy environment. In situations where a web3 app has the true product-market fit, already generates regularly high volume, and is on the cusp of explosive growth, building a custom L2 could be the ideal choice. Partnerships also play a crucial role. Heavyweight partnerships help to create a magnetic L2 destination by leveraging immense user bases to encourage swift application growth. The same goes for truly unique intellectual property that can be predicted to generate considerable consistent transaction volume or does not rely on other applications to succeed. It’s always prudent to consider a dapp’s or ecosystem\u0027s specific use case. A single application like Zora can leverage the network effects around its marketplace to build an ecosystem chain for other applications that are all building around the cause of having more creators onchain. How To Become a Successful L2 Instead of a Ghost Chain Advancement of technology has significantly simplified the deployment of individual rollup chains. With the aid of Rollups-as-a-Service (RaaS) providers, teams can now easily launch and maintain their own rollup chains - especially as these teams continue to reduce both startup and ongoing operational costs. However, despite these lowered barriers to entry, the success of an L2 chain still hinges on several critical factors. Developing a compelling value proposition to attract users is imperative. This could involve offering a unique user or developer experience tailored to specific market niches or local needs. It is also important to understand both the profitability model of an L2 chain and the capital requirements for maintaining a team and necessary chain services. Needless to say, custom chains are never the cheapest path. Zoom Out to Zoom In The future of blockchain is one of many custom L2 chains, offering faster transactions, reduced fees and greater scalability. Imagine this transforming Picture Ethereum morphing from one clogged highway into a vast network of unclogged superhighways. Each lane (or L2 chain) would be able to handle traffic (or transactions), and vehicles (or data) would be able to switch between them as needed. But even as this future emerges we must look to the teams building here and now. Should they build on existing chains or create their own? The latter takes the right tools, guidelines and backing. But it unlocks customization, control and innovation potential down the road. The year 2023 presents exciting possibilities for L2 solutions as integration with interoperable open-source ecosystems enters a pivotal phase. The strategic decision between deploying on an existing network or building a custom L2 revolves around product-market fit, transaction volume and impactful partnerships. Rollups-as-a-Service (RaaS) providers ease entry barriers, but success demands a compelling value proposition and financial prudence. Looking ahead, 2024 marks the rise of interconnected custom L2 chains, transforming blockchain into an efficient network of superhighways. As we venture into this exciting future, the narrative around L2s is rapidly evolving from a mere technological advancement to a cornerstone of mass adoption and integration.

    "title": "Mastering Crypto Security: From Cold Wallets to Phishing Defense",
    "detailedContent": "The realm of cryptocurrency has been persistently haunted by the : of sophisticated cyber-attacks, with the NFT Trader exploit being a recent and alarming example. In this particular breach, hackers managed to bypass existing security protocols, successfully stealing valuable digital assets and demonstrating the ever-evolving tactics employed by cybercriminals in the crypto industry. This incident is not an isolated one; it mirrors a series of major security breaches that have rocked the crypto world. One such significant breach was the infamous Ledger hack, where personal data of thousands of users were compromised. This breach was not just a theft of digital assets but a violation of personal privacy, which had far-reaching consequences for the affected users. These breaches cumulatively underscore the urgent need for more robust and advanced security measures within the crypto space. They serve as a stark reminder that as the value and popularity of digital assets grow, so does the ingenuity and persistence of those who seek to illicitly acquire them. Learning from Historical Breaches Historical breaches in the cryptocurrency world are not merely setbacks but are rich with lessons for investors, developers, and participants in the space. The Ledger incident, among others, bring to light critical vulnerabilities, even in platforms that were considered highly secure. These incidents provide clear evidence that regardless of the size or reputation of an entity, the risk of cyber attacks remains a significant threat. These breaches also emphasize the importance of safeguarding not just the digital assets, but also the personal information of users. They reveal how the security of one aspect can impact the overall safety of an individual’s digital presence. For investors and users in the cryptocurrency space, staying abreast of these breaches, their methods, and implications becomes imperative. Understanding how these breaches occurred is the first step in learning how to fortify defenses against future attacks. Moreover, these incidents highlight the need for a proactive approach to security. They call for continuous learning and adaptation to new threats, understanding that what worked yesterday may not be sufficient tomorrow. It\u0027s crucial for participants in the cryptocurrency space to not only implement the best security practices available, but also to remain vigilant and responsive to the ever-changing landscape of digital threats. This means staying informed, regularly updating security protocols, and being ready to adapt to new methods of attack as they emerge. Key Strategies for Safeguarding Crypto Assets 1. Implementing Cold Wallet Best Practices: A cold wallet, or offline wallet, is one of the most secure ways to store cryptocurrency because it is not connected to the internet, making it less vulnerable to hacks. When using a cold wallet, it\u0027s vital to ensure that the software is up to date and that the wallet is stored in a secure location. Regular backups are also essential, ensuring that assets can be recovered in case of physical damage or loss of the wallet. 2. Safeguarding Your Seed Phrase: The seed phrase, a series of words generated by your wallet, is essentially the key to your cryptocurrency holdings. It should be treated with the same level of security as a bank account password. This means never sharing it with anyone and avoiding storing it digitally, where it could be accessed by hackers. Instead, write it down and store it in a secure place, such as a safe deposit box. 3. Avoiding Phishing Attacks: Phishing attacks are increasingly sophisticated and often the starting point for major security breaches in the crypto world. Be extremely cautious with emails, messages, and websites. Never click on links from unknown or suspicious sources, and always verify the authenticity of any communication claiming to be from a service provider. 4. Regular Security Audits and Updates: Conducting regular security audits of your entire crypto setup is crucial. This involves not only ensuring that the software associated with your cold wallets is up to date but also reviewing and updating the overall security measures you have in place. This practice includes checking for any vulnerabilities in your storage solutions and evaluating your operational security procedures. Conclusion: Vigilance is Key The crypto space, while offering immense opportunities, is fraught with security challenges. Staying vigilant, informed, and proactive in implementing security measures is crucial. Remember, in the world of cryptocurrency, your security is predominantly in your own hands. By following best practices, such as using cold wallets, safeguarding seed phrases, and avoiding phishing attacks, you can significantly reduce the risk of becoming a victim of a hack. As we continue to navigate this exciting but unpredictable terrain, let’s make security our top priority.

    "detailedContent": "ChatGPT has opened the world\u0027s eyes to the power of AI, but as governments realize the reach of these LLMs (large language models), they will start to influence the outputs. LLMs run on open, auditable, and decentralized computing networks will be critical in maintaining and running unbiased platforms that are free from the coercion of the largest corporations and governments. ChatGPT set a record for the fastest product to cross one million users, and while the ‘death of Google’ is certainly overstated, the potential for explosive growth in similar AI products shows the interest in a tool that can answer questions quickly, thoughtfully, and thoroughly. Later iterations of LLMs like ChatGPT will undoubtedly be even more powerful, but with this power and reach will come a freight train of scrutiny and controversy. As these AI engines mature, they will be seen as a source of truth for users, but every company, society and government has its own view as to what the ‘truth’ is regarding certain topics. AI Responses To Delicate Questions Are Already Drawing Attention ChatGPT can explain the benefits of green energy but some users have found it hard to get answers for ‘the importance of carbon based energy’. What would ChatGPT have answered about masking in early 2020 when Dr. Fauci didn’t recommend it? Would that answer be the same in late 2020 when the CDC strongly recommended masking for everyone? The sensitivities get even greater in countries with even more charged topics such as in India or Pakistan, not to mention countries under totalitarian regimes that enforce particular narratives aligned with their agendas. We have already seen the US government’s interest in amplifying or suppressing certain topics on Twitter, and a single source of truth (like a popular LLM) will be even more threatening to governments, politicians, and even communities. How can a company or organization possibly manage all of the competing demands regarding particular answers? We can expect AI engines to be banned in some countries, but where it isn’t banned, it certainly will be subject to regulatory requirements that will erode its credibility and likely will reduce the scope of topics it can address. Alleviating AI Biases via Open Source Engines and Decentralized Computing Networks The first step in reducing outside influence is to build open source AI engines where a community can train the model transparently. Several projects like Bloom and EleutherAI are already working toward this goal. But training is just the beginning; no matter the inputs, scrutiny will be on the outputs, and any organization running a given model will be subject to external pressures. The only inoculation from this pressure is to decentralize the actual running of the AI engine by hosting it on an open, globally distributed, decentralized network, without owners or central points of control. When any storage provider can host an AI model, and any compute provider can process auditable queries, users can trust that the answers they receive are free from hidden bias. The good news is that the technology already exists to make this a reality — but how will it be implemented, and by whom? And some may even find some of the responses from an uncensored version to be morally questionable. We Should Encourage Competition Between LLMs The future will likely see multiple AI engines competing to serve as the source of truth. This competition is healthy and should be encouraged. We have seen open source software outcompete the largest companies before: Linux is the leading open source operating system, built by the global community of developers despite Microsoft’s massive resources and a decade head start with Windows. The open source community could have the same success with building AI LLM models, but as important as building/training the AI, is the running of it. At Fluence, we believe that without open source and decentralized AI, we are in danger of being controlled and influenced by a few huge companies and governments. We see a future with decentralized compute that allows an inexpensive, highly performant, auditable, and fully-decentralized cloud which frees applications from the centralized, closed cloud ecosystems — and from oligopoly censorship – empowering us all. - Tom Trowbridge is an accomplished business builder and web3 focused entrepreneur, and the Co-Founder \u0026 CEO of Fluence Labs, an institutional grade decentralized serverless computing network that frees computation from centralized cloud providers.

    "title": "Identity Verification: The Keystone for Tokenizing Real-World Assets",
    "detailedContent": "The tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) is one of the most exciting blockchain use cases to have emerged in recent years. The ability to tokenize a physical asset such as a painting or property unlocks all kinds of new possibilities. Not only can it be fractionalized, but it can be used as collateral, paving the way for additional DeFi applications. But for all their brimming potential, tokenized RWAs have seen modest adoption so far. This is because these assets come with rules dictating who can trade them and how. With DeFi infrastructure still catching up, RWAs remain accessible to a narrow onchain audience – but that’s poised to change. The Case for Asset Tokenization Placing real-world assets onchain brings a number of key advantages. For one thing, blockchain architecture makes it possible to trade these assets 24/7 with global availability. The use of a single ledger of truth also ensures accuracy in terms of pricing. Every participant knows that they are paying the same rate for the same tokenized asset. Arguably the greatest benefit from tokenizing RWAs, however, is liquidity. It’s hard to sell a housing development in a day. It takes time to offload a renaissance painting. These are highly illiquid and non-fungible assets that are not easily disposed of, despite their undoubted value. But when they’re tokenized and split into smaller parts, they can be traded instantly by investors all over the world. Companies such as Maple and Backed are bringing real-world assets onchain and in the process allowing institutional capital to enter. This unlocks new use cases, particularly when it comes to lending and stablecoin collateralization. The full potential of RWAs is still being discovered, with innovation occurring apace as this blockchain sector takes shape. What Makes RWAs Different Unlike regular crypto tokens, RWAs must be backed by the physical assets they represent. And not just in word, but with verifiable proof: if a platform is tokenizing gold, it needs attestations of physical deposits of the gold; likewise if it’s fractionalizing art by dividing an Old Master into 1,000 shares. When it comes to RWAs, “trust me bro” doesn’t cut it. This means that not just anyone can launch a RWA market: entities who do so must be registered with the financial regulator where they are domiciled. Similarly, not just anyone can trade RWAs since many of the instruments they are composed of constitute securities, which are only accessible to accredited investors. The solution to this challenge lies in identity verification: a system for demonstrating that those trading RWAs have the permission to do so. But the form such a system should take has still to be settled. Permission in a Permissionless Environment The permissionless design of blockchain is one of its greatest strengths. It means that every onchain user is treated the same, regardless of who they are or where they’re from. Notably, 1 ETH in your wallet is as good as 1 ETH in anyone else’s. But as we’ve established, not everything that can be accessed on blockchain rails is designed to be universally available. The solution to this dilemma lies in identity verification. There are a number of approaches to establishing user verification in an onchain environment. One method is to enforce KYC at the point of platform access, such as using social login coupled with wallet signing, to bond the individual’s identity to their digital one. This is how KYC is done with centralized exchanges, but it’s an inelegant solution when applied to DeFi. Moreover, many users have understandable concerns about entrusting their data to multiple platforms, which increases the surface area for identity theft. An alternative approach is to enforce verification at the protocol level instead, which is the approach we’re taking with Haven1. That way, all users who interact with the network are verified once and then able to freely interact with all the platforms and applications deployed on it. This might sound radical for DeFi users accustomed to using public blockchains such as Ethereum, but it provides a secure and frictionless solution that still allows innovation to thrive. Finally, there is the option of using decentralized identifiers (DIDs). These allow anyone to create a globally unique identity that can be used to demonstrate that its owner has completed verification. Such self-sovereign identities are particularly suited to blockchain-based systems, and free protocols from having to implement their own verification program complete with the cost and compliance burden this carries. RWAs Are Just Getting Started Tokenized real-world assets have the potential to bring billions of dollars in value on-chain and to bring liquidity to illiquid markets. But before that can happen, the infrastructure needs to be in place to support them. This means introducing identity verification solutions that are robust, reliable, and secure – while also respecting the rights of users to maintain pseudo-anonymity in the course of ordinary DeFi activity. From oil to treasury bonds and commercial property to fine art, when it comes to real-world assets, all are ripe for tokenization. But there’s little point in tokenizing these commodities if the available investor pool is tiny. Broadening access for RWAs calls for building out the infrastructure for trading them, starting with identity verification. Get that right and everything else will follow. - Jeff Owens is Co-Founder of Haven1 – an EVM-compatible L1 blockchain purpose-built to provide a secure and trusted environment for on-chain finance.

    "title": "5 Emerging Trends That Point to 2024 As a Turning Point",
    "detailedContent": "Ask most gamers what they think of blockchain gaming and they’ll likely scoff. Along with metaverse and NFT, blockchain gaming has become a toxic word in many circles. Can’t blame gamers - blockchain gaming is missing the whole point of gaming, to have fun. With such promising features that would improve the overall gaming life cycle - scalability, ownership, and interoperability - how did web3 get it so wrong? In the past five years, reports show that 75.5% of web3 games have failed. There have been a number of contributing factors to this: web3 games suffered from poor UX and design, gameplays were often thinly veiled financial schemes, and the collapse of the NFT market dragged down some of the more nuanced applications of NFTs, gaming included. A theme at the recent Gamesbeat Awards was that “blockchain needs to be fun” – an aspect that may have once been lost in the “play to earn” (P2E) craze from those hoping to make quick money. Perhaps paradoxically, 2024 is shaping up differently as increased investments, renewed pizzazz, technological leaps, and other factors alter the trajectory of the gaming sector. In particular, 5 promising developments underway are likely to drive web3 gaming to new levels of popularity, and most importantly, new levels of entertainment.

Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox, along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right, millions love us!) — what are you waiting for? 1. Investments in Web3 Gaming Start To Bear Fruit In 2023, $2.3 billion USD was invested into blockchain gaming projects — $600M alone in the third quarter. Major ecosystem leaders like Anomica Brands have been steadily investing across the web3 gaming space. The influx of capital this year, despite a range-bound mood in the broader crypto market, demonstrates an underlying commitment to the long-term potential of web3 gaming. The impact of these investments is not immediate, but cumulative. The gaming development cycle is typically lengthy with an average of three to seven years in development, even when not taking into account new technologies like blockchain and NFTs. The cumulative impact of investments over the past couple of years should begin to bear fruit, with web3 games likely to emerge in 2024 that are more complex, thoughtful, and as entertaining as traditional ones. 2. “GameFi” Provides a Much-Needed Upgrade to In-Game Economics Some of the earliest web3 games were marketed as P2E games. These applications, though they resembled games, were thinly veiled token farming operations, rife with risks like rug pulls, and were impossible to explain to anyone outside of our community. P2E inadvertently became a symbol of the challenges in merging crypto with gaming, specifically by revealing that crypto has a tendency to financialize everything, and ‘missing the forest for the trees.’ Games deserve to be fun, not necessarily financially productive. However, games are not devoid of financial incentives. Robust, complex, deeply integrated in-game economics exist across the traditional gaming ecosystem. An approach to these types of game economies is necessary — the crypto ecosystem just happened to strike out epically on its first attempt. In fact, 80% of blockchain gamers have expressed interest in using their crypto for in-game transactions. 3. The NFT Ecosystem Has Matured From Its JPEG Infancy In 2021, Steam, the dominant PC gaming marketplace, outlawed any games built on the blockchain or with NFT utilities. Quite a buzz kill for the start of the ‘web3 gaming revolution’. Whether it was a result of consumer safety from unregistered securities or back to the thesis - gamers just want to have fun - many of the gatekeepers of the gaming world stopped web3 in its tracks by targeting NFTs specifically. A lot has changed though during the bear market of 2023 when it comes to NFTs. Instead of being the centerpieces as they were in 2021, NFTs will be used as tools that enhance the gaming experience with players having a new sense of control over their gameplay by the ability to own, sell or trade in-game assets. Roblox, for example, reported that its Gen Z audience bought 1.6 billion digital fashion items and accessories in the first three quarters of 2023, up 38% year over year, signaling the growing importance of digital identity and expression among the younger generation. 4. No One Expected Candy Crush - Would They Have Expected Pixels? This year, Pixels, a farming game, became the first web3 game since Axie Infinity to surpass 100,000 daily active users, which has seen major interest in countries such as the Philippines. The Philippines, along with Nigeria, Pakistan, Singapore, Vietnam, South Korea, Hong Kong, China and the UAE, have been among the top 15 countries most interested in web3 gaming-related search terms according to Google Analytics data, for 3 consecutive years from 2021 to 2023. This points to a potential massive global reach of web3 gaming. Countries in APAC regions have shown growing interest in blockchain games when it comes to mobile gaming and North America accounted for the highest market size for blockchain gamers with over $30 billion market size in 2022. While Candy Crush wasn’t released with the expectation that its core audience would be women over 30, do we ever really know what to expect when these games are released? 5. The Ecosystem Has Found and Built the “Missing Pieces” of Web3 Gaming The newly announced game from Pudgy Penguins, Pudgy World, is a fantastic example of how gaming can be both blockchain native, and gain interest from non-crypto natives. https://twitter.com/pudgypenguins/status/1733672528453705819 A report from the Blockchain Game Alliance showed that 51% of users believe player onboarding is the biggest obstacle. Pudgy World is said to be an open-world, immersive multiplayer experience in which not only can Pudgy holders easily begin playing, but so can those who own Pudgy Toys – it\u0027s as simple as scanning a QR code to create an account (Webkinz, anyone?). Removing web3 roadblocks is a massive step forward when it comes to this new era of gaming. In addition, communication plays a vital role in gaming, whether it’s between players, NPCs and players, or between the game and the player. But in web3 games, no scalable and user-friendly decentralized communication solution has existed — until now. In 2023, a variety of companies are now offering cheap, fast, private, and secure decentralized communication. The emergence of these technologies indicates that the blockchain ecosystem is now equipped with the necessary tools to create engaging games. While the integration of blockchain technology, including NFTs and cryptocurrency, offers innovative monetization and ownership possibilities, the core appeal of any game fundamentally lies in its entertainment value. This year, the gamers won the battle and were heard loud and clear about the pitfalls of current blockchain gaming. But the growing pains have clearly led to a change, the proof is in the data. The next gen of games (built on blockchain) is expected to offer not just novel economic models but also a genuinely enjoyable and immersive gaming experience, fulfilling the promise of blockchain technology in revolutionizing the gaming sector.

    "title": "Why the Medical Industry (and Your Doctor) Should Move Onchain",
    "detailedContent": "In 1951, only eight months after her diagnosis, Henrietta Lacks, a Black woman from the city of Baltimore, Maryland, lost her fight against cervical cancer at the age of 31. Following her diagnosis, Lacks was referred by her primary care doctor to Johns Hopkins, where another physician, George Otto Gey, took a biopsy of what turned out to be a cancerous mass in her cervix. During her treatment — and without her knowledge or consent — two samples were taken from Lacks, which later became known as the HeLa immortal cell line, and turned out to be revolutionary in the future of contemporary biomedical research. Neither Lacks nor her family were ever notified about the decision to harvest her cells or those of countless others, which were used to developed research and treatment, saving myriad lives as a result of them. While Lacks’ family eventually received partial legal control over her DNA code in a historic settlement in 2023, her story remains a case study for the lack of transparency, accountability, access, and consent in the medical industry — and especially how it affects minorities. Seventy-two years later, blockchain technology offers a potential solution to the problem that plagued not only Henrietta Lacks but so many others like her who exist at the whims of digital health access inequities. Tokenization equals transparency — and a lot more “NFTs have the capability of putting patients back in the driver’s seat as opposed to keeping health data vendors in total control of the fate and use of their data.” — National Library of Medicine The beauty of the blockchain lies in its immutable, transparent, and tamperproof nature. This sprawling network of interconnected, peer-to-peer nodes act like a trail of breadcrumbs, always pointing back to a specific block settlement or transaction hash: a unique address of an onchain transaction that serves as the record (or proof) that something has occurred. From digital art to currencies, this is what makes blockchain so effective in verifying ownership and provenance of a specific asset. While the NFT boom of 2021 demonstrated this power mainly in digital art, it’s just as powerful for verifying the origin and journey of other data — including health data, which, in the early 90s, became primarily electronic. Let’s explain why this is a potential game-changer for medicine. Ownership \u0026 Transparency Whether you\u0027re posting on Instagram or filling out a patient form on a tablet in a waiting room, you might be surprised how little ownership or immediate access you have over your data. This is where the fine print gets all so important, albeit troubling. New York state’s website will alert you to the many restrictions and tedious roadblocks around your health data, which you must request (via a form), can be denied access to (you can appeal), and can be charged for. While rights under the HIPAA have drastically improved since the days of Henrietta Lacks, unethical things still happen to your health data every day. Enter blockchain and tokenization. In a web3-powered health industry, everything from patient intake and consent forms to your actual medical records and even tissue samples can be brought onchain. Instead of signing with a pen (or these days, finger on a touchscreen), you\u0027d sign onchain forms using your web3 wallet. From there, you\u0027d be able to track the journey of your tokenized medical data, which could be embedded into the metadata of a dynamicNFT that evolves per your medical history. A similar system is already being piloted by the University of Pittsburgh\u0027s Breast Disease Research. If medical portals and providers are brought onchain, patients and doctors wouldn\u0027t be forced to rely on archaic, expensive EHR (electronic health record) software like Cerner — another centralized walled data garden — to track records. This increased level of transparency could also be used as a more efficient and transparent form of inventory management for tissue and organ donors, who often must rely on gatekept, hard-to-track records. Authenticity \u0026 Access With onchain medical data, patients and medical providers would gain more confidence in the authenticity of that data, which could be verified between parties. This verification would help protect against medical scams, shoddy information, and illegal data sharing and provide transparent, immediate access to patients whose wallet addresses match their health data and providers. Patients would no longer have to apply (and wait) to access data that should be theirs. Regarding authentication, everything from machine to tissue samples to organs could be verified via onchain technology, protecting against counterfeit medicine and reducing the dangers of the organ donor black market. Monetization If Henrietta Lacks’ cell data was minted onchain, her family would have known precisely where it went. Through the design and adoption of web3 health applications, Lacks’ family could have given consent to the utilization and access of her data. Think of this like creator royalties in NFTs, but for patients to track and even sell ongoing access to their health data to those who need it for research purposes. This feature could provide additional income for patients faced with high medical costs as well as researchers who publish their work onchain. Memberships With a rise in the popularity of medical concierge services and membership programs, this space is ripe for web3 disruption. Instead of relying on traditional membership structures and acquisition practices via centralized intermediaries, doctors can sell membership NFTs directly to patients, including loyalty tiers and perks, complete with evolving metadata and the verifiable, transparent features mentioned above. For an industry that often feels cold, rigid, and intimidating, this could add a level of dynamic engagement and customization. Power to the patients It won’t be easy to see many of these use cases come to life in a space that’s heavily controlled by the likes of Big Tech and Big Pharma. But, just as cryptocurrency, NFTs, DeFi, and DAOs have helped democratic access and opportunity from the few to the many, the potential of bringing medicine onchain can return more power to the people — and the patients who need it most. - Raakhee Miller is the CEO of Mojito, a leading NFT platform solution that enables companies to create new, valuable business verticals and has generated more than $100 million in sales.

    "title": "The Year of SocialFi Begins in APAC",
    "detailedContent": "We\u0027re entering a transformative phase for social media in web3, marked by advanced decentralized applications that offer value ownership and high-speed scalability. An era where content like meme culture and digital art are not just forms of expression but catalysts for building vibrant, self-sustaining communities. With 15 years of experience operating at the heart of Hong Kong\u0027s social media scene, I\u0027ve witnessed the rapid growth and promise of the creator economy, particularly originating from the APAC region. Being the first Asian executive to lead a company, 9GAG, through Y-Combinator, has given me a unique perspective. We know that the introduction of web3 opened a new opportunity for creators – one where ownership and control over their content and earnings are firmly placed back in their hands, redefining traditional practices of the web2 world. So what do we call this in web3? The Introduction of SocialFi SocialFi - the synthesis of the best parts of social networking and the best parts of decentralized finance (DeFi) - is the latest evolution of use cases for blockchain technology, and it offers several key benefits to creators: New Business Models for Creators: SocialFi introduces new business models where the value generated within the platform is shared among users, creators, and investors, creating a more equitable ecosystem. Ownership and Control: SocialFi platforms are designed with the creator in mind. Now, creators have control over their data and content. New technology ensures that users, not the platform, own their content. Community Building and Engagement: SocialFi platforms foster stronger community engagement by aligning the interests of the platform with both creators and fans. There is increased incentivization to contribute positively to the community, leading to more meaningful interactions and curated experiences. SocialFi revolutionizes digital ownership and democratizes the landscape by leveraging web3 incentives, engaging real users in content interaction, and capturing the myriad ways we connect and share in a transformative platform. Imagine a world where OG Taylor Swift fans gain social recognition and tangible rewards. SocialFi promises to transform fans and curators into pivotal contributors in a new digital economy. For instance, these top fans could enjoy exclusive engagement experiences with Taylor Swift, including intimate Q\u0026A sessions or behind-the-scenes access. Additionally, they might be given priority in purchasing concert tickets, ensuring they can see her perform live before anyone else. This model addresses the previously unacknowledged dedication of early fans, who have historically supported artists without any direct rewards. Their loyalty and early adoption can be celebrated and rewarded, creating a more inclusive fan experience. How APAC’s Social Media Platforms Are Influencing The West Consider WeChat\u0027s impact in Asia: it has transformed social interaction, messaging, and digital transactions for billions of people since its 2011 launch. A feat for any technology company, WeChat achieved 50 million active users within a year and soared to 355 million annual users in four years. The introduction of WeChat Pay in 2013 further accelerated its growth, reaching 1.133 billion active users by 2023. WeChat exemplifies the APAC region\u0027s grasp of the value of mega social apps, a trend not yet fully replicated in the West. APAC\u0027s distinct readiness to embrace SocialFi positions it as a leader in demonstrating the benefits of a digital economy to a global audience. Platforms that skillfully attract large audiences and leverage web3 are likely to initially flourish in areas like Asia, where there\u0027s an established understanding of the fusion of social and finance, before spreading globally, mirroring TikTok\u0027s success. SocialFi\u0027s Role in a Borderless Digital Society The concept of SocialFi is universal. The goal of SocialFi is to dismantle the restrictive ecosystem that traditional finance and centralized media have designed to profit off creators and the larger economy. This leveling of the playing field, where diverse voices are not just heard but amplified and rewarded, is the essence of SocialFi. It\u0027s a bold leap towards a future where the value of creativity isn\u0027t dictated by geography or gatekeepers but by the global community\u0027s embrace and support. This shift is evolutionary and the next major milestone for the creator economy. - Ray Chan is the CEO and co-founder of 9GAG, a global entertainment network with a 200 million global audience, and the CEO and Founder of Memeland, the fastest and largest growing SocialFi ecosystem and web3 venture studio. An alumnus of Y Combinator and 500 Startups, Ray has a track record of fostering community-driven digital innovation. Prior to his success with 9GAG and Memeland, he contributed to Singboard and played a pivotal role at aNobii, an online reading community acquired by a consortium including HMV Group and major publishers in 2010. Memeland, born from the creators of 9GAG, is the fastest and largest growing SocialFi ecosystem and web3 venture studio, championing community ownership through creativity, $MEME token, and NFTs. With roots in a small project that quickly grew into a global platform with a 200 million monthly active audience, known as 9GAG, Memeland was created in June 2021 and leverages blockchain technology to unite creators and communities, bringing an ecosystem of SocialFi products to market.

    "detailedContent": "Another year is almost in the books and crypto is back, baby! This year has been a rollercoaster of emotions for most of us: While this year might not have been as eventful as last year — remember FTX? Terra? Celsius? — that does not mean we didn’t have one heck of a year! Here are CMC\u0027s picks for the top 10 crypto stories of 2023. Subscribe Join us in showcasing the cryptocurrency revolution, one newsletter at a time. Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox, along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right, millions love us!) — what are you waiting for? #10: SocialFi Combines Crypto With Social Media Sometime in mid-2023, when Bitcoin was crabbing in the $20,000s, a new mania captured the attention of the crypto markets: SocialFi. Friend.tech became the newest, hottest platform everyone wanted in on. For a few weeks, Crypto Twitter feeds exploded with invite codes and “alpha for keyholders.” The hype died down, but be prepared for Friend.tech 2.0 in 2024. View post on Twitter Read also: What is SocialFi? #9: Real-World Assets Make A Real Impact Real-world assets (RWA) have made a strong bid to become one of the top narratives of the 2024 bull market. In our explainer of the real-world asset sector, we highlighted that this vertical could grow significantly in the future. And it did! Several countries have launched real-world asset programs: The Philippines launched the first tokenized treasury. Singapore is expanding efforts to tokenize assets. Brazil plans for a tokenization program in 2024. Big banks, such as UBS, are also getting into asset tokenization. And, of course, crypto-native protocols like MakerDAO have experienced a big revival thanks to the RWA narrative. With greater institutional adoption expected, real-world assets are primed to grow in 2024. #8: Ethereum Upgrades Itself Again Ethereum had a quiet year overall – but it\u0027s biggest story happened right at the start of 2023. The impending Shapella upgrade sparked an initial frenzy around Liquid Staking narrative as the community rushed to prepare.Shapella finally enabled stakers and validators to unstake and withdraw ETH rewards. This marked Ethereum\u0027s full transition into a proof-of-stake chain. Here is everything you need to know about the Shapella upgrade. It finally went live in April, marking a highly anticipated milestone. However, Ethereum took a backseat for the rest of 2023 as Bitcoin ETF mania went into overdrive. But make no mistake, the next upgrade is already on its way: EIP-4844 could finally boost layer-2 adoption to the next level. View post on Twitter #7: Tether Reinvents Itself Tether has long faced controversies around the opacity of its reserves. But 2023 marked a major shift towards transparency and cooperation for the stablecoin giant. Former CTO Paolo Ardoino was appointed as the new CEO of Tether. The firm invested heavily in Bitcoin mining, including a $500M stake. It reported record levels of cash reserves in Q3 of 2023. Tether is also actively cooperating with regulators these days. It announced cooperation on freezing and blocking OFAC-sanctioned entities, even assisting the FBI and Secret Service. Critics have long predicted Tether\u0027s demise, but under Ardoino, everything points to a more ethical and sustainable future. This story flew under the radar in 2023, but it is of remarkable importance for the crypto industry, given USDT’s position as the stablecoin with the largest market capitalization. Read also: What is Tether? #6: Coinbase Makes A Stand Coinbase stepped into the crypto spotlight in 2023 amidst regulatory uncertainty in the US. It was an eventful year for the exchange. Coinbase launched its own layer-two blockchain called Base. It went back and forth with the SEC, including lawsuits and counter-suits. The company\u0027s stock rallied from its lows. ARK Invest sold its Coinbase shares at an 18-month high, possibly to stronger institutional hands like the South Korean pension fund which bought in. Of course, the biggest story may only come next year, as Coinbase is the proposed middleman acting as custodian for a possible spot Bitcoin ETF. It has been far from a quiet year for Coinbase. But 2024 could become even rowdier. #5: CZ Steps Down Changpeng Zhao has been the main character of crypto ever since he founded Binance. In less than 5 years, CZ took Binance from a startup to the leading crypto exchange in the world. In 2023, a legal judgment led CZ to step down from the CEO role as part of an agreement with authorities. He passed the CEO reins to Richard Teng as Binance entered a new phase. View post on Twitter #4: SBF Rides Off Into Prison SBF’s story arc has been going from bad to worse in 2023. There are too many subplots to sum this one up in a few lines, but some of the juiciest ones include: SBF considered paying off Donald Trump not to run for President. Caroline Ellison throwing SBF under the bus in her testimony. SBF being unanimously convicted of fraud and money laundering. Yikes, dumb situation. Reportedly, SBF is making the best out of his situation and is trading mackerels in prison, while waiting for his sentence. How long he will stay behind bars will be decided in 2024 – but it could be anywhere between a few decades and forever. A story that crypto should write the final chapter about as soon as possible. #3: AI Sends Everyone Into A Frenzy 2023 may become the year of BC in crypto: before ChatGPT and after ChatGPT. Ever since OpenAI launched ChatGPT at the beginning of the year, the AI hype train has been running full steam. The top AI coins by market capitalization currently trade around $20B. Everyone is scrambling to find the next undiscovered AI crypto gem. Telegram bots are falling over themselves to help traders trade with AI. Now imagine what will happen when retail interest comes well and truly back. AI and crypto – a match made in heaven. Especially when Arthur Hayes is bullish: View post on Twitter Read also: Blockchain and AI #2: Ordinals Frenzy On Bitcoin NFTs on Bitcoin? *Larry David voice* Meh, I don’t think so. And I’m never wrong about this stuff ever. If you had made that prediction at the start of 2023, boy would you have been wrong! NFTs on Bitcoin is, kind of, a real thing now. Enter Ordinals. Ordinals are a way to inscribe sats, sort of like writing on your dollar bills to distinguish them. They kicked off a massive hype in 2023 and were, probably, in no small way responsible for the surge in price. The trading volume of Ordinals made another leg up after Binance listed them. ORDI, the first memecoin on Ordinals, is now trading at a multi-billion dollar market capitalization. This story could just be getting started. Read also: What are Bitcoin Ordinals? #1: Wen Spot Bitcoin ETF? The undisputed biggest crypto headline of 2023 was the remarkable Bitcoin price recovery. The King is back. Bitcoin, yet again, left every other major asset in the dust, as it posted a cool 155% YTD return. Most of this price recovery can probably be attributed to the anticipation around a possible spot Bitcoin ETF. 2023 may be remembered as the year when everything aligned for the spot ETF to finally be approved. Wen ETF? Soon! Very soon, by the looks of it. If the timeline for a spot ETF holds up, we might kick off 2024 with a bang and a round of approvals by the SEC. VanEck already filed $HODL as a ticker, as the market prepares for the approval potentially in January 2024. Read also: Spot ETF vs Futures ETF – What’s The Difference?

    "title": "In the Next Bull Run, Web3 Digital Identity and Reputation Are Everything",
    "detailedContent": "“It takes many good deeds to build a good reputation, and only one bad one to lose it.” — Benjamin Franklin It’s hard to imagine an industry where these words ring more true than in web3. It is a place built on transformative technologies, disruptive ideas, and, for lack of a better word, dreamers. These dreamers have built blockchain-based empires on their revolutionary ideas, game-changing technologies, and oft-radical reputations — empires we’ve witnessed come crumbling down at the drop of a hat. In web3, we love a daily dose of inspiration to lift our spirits (especially in market headwinds) and remind us why we got into this often difficult and unpredictable business. We love our GMs, memes, conferences, parties, product announcements, and our leaders, whose daring and often eccentric personalities come to define them and even their products and communities. We have our maxis and bulls — and these spirited communities gravitate towards the technologies and products they believe in and those who have built them. We’ve learned repeatedly, but especially this year, in web3 that behind every headline and price chart is a human, and humans are defined by not just who they are but what they’ve done. In the end, reputation and identity are everything. And in web3, we’ve often lost sight of that. In web3, words — and people — are complicated User-centricity is a key value proposition when building products and communities on blockchain technology. We build for the many, not the few. Whether it\u0027s decentralized finance or decentralized social, what\u0027s often most revolutionary about our products and communities is that you don\u0027t need to trust a third party (trustlessness), ask for permission to participate (permissionless), and that ideally, you gain complete control over your identity and data (self-sovereignty). Ironically, however, in an ideally-decentralized industry where we democratize so much power and capabilities to the user, we still put so much (often blind) faith into those who sit on top: the founders, CEOs, and even the developers and product builders whose behind-the-scenes work shapes so much of what happens out in front. As we see the gradually illuminating horns of a coming bull market, we can\u0027t forget how much illusion and dishonesty sent us into the chilling depths of our most recent cycle. We can\u0027t forget how much words — and the reputation and identities behind them — matter. But can we really blame web3 users for following leaders like SBF so blindly into the sunset? While \"not your keys, not your crypto\" is a mantra every user is responsible for knowing and understanding, web3 is an industry built upon complex technology and people. In web3, for better or for worse, everyone is shooting for the moon, and people align with tech often without understanding who built it, what happens under the hood, and how those two things are intricately connected. We say \"don\u0027t trust, verify,\" — and I believe that should go for verifying people\u0027s identity and reputation just as much as any transaction. Bringing reputation and identity onchain From crowded community channels, where the lines between alpha, memes, and menace become blurred, to the words of exchange founders in the global press, it can be hard to weed out the noise in web3. But just like NFTs changed the game for bringing verifiability of assets on-chain, the same can — and should — go for people. A decentralized reputation and identity system redefines how we measure and verify trust — in a space where anonymity and decentralization is often the reason many got here in the first place. The only way to truly verify trust and reputation is to think about it in the same way as Satoshi did: design and utilize an infrastructure that gives everyone who wants to participate the tools to do so with confidence that’s not reliant on the words or personalities of others but their tokenized actions. Whether it’s connected to DAOs or Discord, an on-chain network and market centered on measurable credibility, reputation, and identity gives users the toolkit to know their fellow community members as well as the key stakeholders behind companies they decide to engage or invest in. For institutions, regulators, and potential business partners, a technological solution to identity and reputation separates bad actors from good, ethical investments. This ability is something many people want — just look at the 2022 institutional investor survey of respondents who stated that trust remains a key factor in sourcing partnerships. Let’s do it for the next generation Life and certainly web3 moves in cycles. Looking back at this moment, what do we want to be remembered for? I, for one, want to be someone who makes things better, safer, and more efficient for those who want to participate in a space and community I am so passionate about. For those who put their heart and soul into web3, we owe them that level of confidence and control. To make this new future a reality, change is not only warranted but essential. We can’t allow another cycle of devastating loss, bad headlines, dishonest leadership, and careless customer action to occur. Instead, we must work to replace those troubling realities with an emphasis on real, verified reputation and identity across web3’s many environments. In web3, if we truly don’t want to repeat the mistakes of the past, we can — and must — build for the future. And a better future at that. - Charles Wayn is a serial web3 entrepreneur and the Co-Founder of Galxe, the leading platform for building web3 community.

As no passwords are included in the data we have seen, we believe that it is most likely sourced from another platform where users may have reused passwords across multiple sites. We believe that a bad actor (or actors) took a list of leaked emails (this list that claims to be from CoinMarketCap) and compared it with other batches of leaked data. This is how the list of emails that claims to be from CoinMarketCap looks real — it’s because it’s a “cleaned” email dataset from the Dark Web that has occurred in previous leaked email sets totally unrelated to CoinMarketCap. We can state with confidence that the leaks did not come from CoinMarketCap servers. We ran a comprehensive security check and there is no trace of any security breach of our servers.

    "summary": "Flipside Crypto takes a look into what is going on with Polygon transactions.",
    "title": "The Money Making Machine Behind the Polygon Spam Attacks",
    "detailedContent": "Since May, there’s been a lot of talk about Polygon “flipping” Ethereum — at first in terms of transaction count (at its peak, there were 8M transactions per day happening on Polygon, compared to 1.2M TPD on Ethereum) and just last week in terms of active user count — rising to a record high of 566,516 active addresses on Saturday, surpassing Ethereum for the first time. However, it’s also been reported in a Polygon forum that the network has been under a spam attack since May, which has been inflating network utilization numbers by 90%. Every block was full of users sending meaningless transactions and just paying for the gas fees. With 1 gwei in gas price, or 0.000000001 MATIC / gas, and a 20 million gas limit per block, it only costs around 0.02 MATIC to spam an entire block on Polygon, or $1,000 for an entire day. So it’s cheap to flood a whole block — but still, what’s the incentive? This article sheds light on the mechanism happening behind these spam transactions, and the profits at stake. Our research suggests that increasing gas fees to 30 gwei could be very effective in this case. Access Polygon data here The Arbitrage Bot Behind these Spam Attacks Identifying the Sender On average, the top 10 DApps in terms of weekly transaction count add up to 3 million transactions per week, or 420k transactions per day. With 4M-6M transactions happening on the whole network daily, the top 10 applications account for less than 10% of the total network - so where are the rest of the transactions coming from? With a simple query we were able to find the top 10 addresses in terms of total transactions. The top two contracts, “0xa81ce04168e41a47f68a975d67a00fbef729af9b” and “0x84e5bc3df0df0f543648f250443c6f4077218312,” have been interacting with 2 million transactions daily — which accounts for roughly 30% of the network’s total transaction count. Source: Polygon dashboard Looking at the details of their transactions, we can see that these two contracts are arbitrage bots. They are the target of millions of transactions every day, and initiate thousands of daily transactions to DEXes themselves. Identifying the Recipient Source: Transaction For example, in the above trade, this contract sent out 0.153 MATIC worth 0.23$ and receive back 4.33 MATIC worth 6.5$ An arbitrage bot is a bot that captures the different exchange rates between platforms to make profit. For example, if Uniswap has 3700$ / ETH and Sushi has 3600$ / ETH, you can simultaneously buy on Sushi and sell on Uniswap to capture the 100$ difference. We now have the full picture: spam attack transactions act as the trigger for these arbitrage bots to make their own transactions on DEXes. By plotting the total transactions sent out by these bot contracts, we can see that they make around 2,000 – 4,000 transactions per day, which is nothing unusual. Source: Polygon dashboard We don’t know the contract’s code so we cannot explain why it needs so many input transactions versus just 2,000–4,000 trades per day. The likely theory is that the owner just wants to spam the contract so others cannot front-run the real trade. So someone has a bot that floods a block with noise to protect from front running, as opposed to using priority fees to ensure they are always first in the block. But is it really cheaper to buy a whole block than to just pay exorbitant prices to be first? How much is this spammer making? By tracking the contract creator we can see that the bot was initially funded with 14 ETH (~$3,775) and made multiple transactions back for a total of 218.5 ETH (equivalent to ~$825,000 at the time of writing) that was bridged back to Ethereum. That’s an average of $6,800 a day in profits over the past 120 days — which is how long the bot has been running. Increasing Transaction Fees On Oct. 5, 2021, the network’s co-founder recommended increasing the minimum transaction fee from 1 gwei to 30 gwei - raising the cost of spamming an entire day to $30,000 to disincentivize spam transactions from happening. Shortly after the adjustment, the spam transactions dropped 75% from 2M to just 500k TPD. Polygon’s daily transactions also dropped 50% from 6M to just over 3M TPD. This is clearly shown in the graph above. As shown in the graph above, the network’s utilization rate also dropped down from 90% back to 60% which is a healthier rate. This leaves a lot of room for others to build on Polygon. It’s worth noting that even with the 75% drop, spam transactions still account for 16.7% of the network’s daily transactions. This means bots are still spending around $5,000 a day at the current gas price, or 83% of their daily profit, to keep this operation going.

    "title": "The Shadow of \"Stagflation\" Spreads Many Countries, Investment Institutions Increase Crypto Investments: Weekly Market Review From TokenInsight",
    "detailedContent": "The performance of the crypto market has reached a new high since June. The main reasons are the persistence of high inflation expectations in many countries, the strengthening of \"stagflation\" risks, and the SEC\u0027s notice of no objection to Bitcoin futures ETFs. Bitcoin futures ETFs have been notified by the SEC of no objection, which means that the world\u0027s largest capital market is officially open to cryptos, and the biggest regulatory risks have been eliminated in the short term, clearing the way for mainstream institutions to enter the market. Under the influence of the temporary increase of the US debt ceiling, the high market risk appetite, and the endorsement of institutions entering the market, US debt and US dollar both fell. Although many central banks have released the news of bringing forward interest rate hikes, the high inflation pressure shows that the overall liquidity of the market is expected to remain at a high level for a long time. The Bull Market Is Still Continuing After a short trough, the crypto market entered an explosive phase this week. In terms of market value, as of 4:00 UTC on Oct. 15, the market value of the whole market has risen to $2.45T and is about to approach an all-time high ($2.54T). From the perspective of volatility, the market volatility difference continued to expand this week, while the implied volatility was higher than the realized volatility, indicating that the market is stable in the bull market stage, and there is no sign of decline. From the perspective of skewness, market expectations have risen in the short term, but the medium and long-term expectations have not changed much compared with last week. An important reason is that a large number of professional investors have turned to bulls since the beginning of August. From the perspective of the futures term structure, on the one hand, the bullish sentiment in the derivatives market is obvious, and the overall premium of futures has risen to a new high since May. On the other hand, the premium of forwarding futures term structure on major futures exchanges has obviously declined, indicating that although investors are optimistic, they are not going to pay more premium for the future due to worries about the risk of monetary policy tightening and macro liquidity contraction. Anti-Inflationary Demand: the Source of the Bull Market The outstanding performance of the crypto market this week is inseparable from changes in the macro-environment. On Oct. 13, the September CPI in the United States was announced, in which the inflation rate was reported to be 5.4%, higher than market expectations, and much higher than the 2% target set by the Federal Reserve. In contrast, the non-agricultural index, which reflects the economic growth situation, hit a new low. Considering that high inflation of more than 5% has lasted for half a year, investors have insufficient confidence in the Fed to reduce inflation. Economic growth is still lower than expected, indicating that the stimulus to the economy by releasing liquidity has not had enough effect. Affected by this, institutional investors are turning to stocks, commodities, and cryptos to hedge inflation risks. In addition, a number of macro indicators show that the risk of \"stagflation\" is increasing. Under the pressure of flooded liquidity, developed country economies such as South Korea and New Zealand have responded by raising interest rates, while the UK has also indicated that it may raise interest rates earlier than December. The divergence between the US Institute for Supply Management\u0027s (ISM) manufacturing production index and the price index, and the US 10-year Treasury yield exceeded 1.61% on October 11 despite the increase in real yields, may confirm the threat of stagflation. OPEC\u0027s slow and steady production growth may pose a serious inflation threat and have a counterproductive impact on oil demand. The Federal Reserve is facing concerns about inflation risks and stagnant economic growth, but the Fed\u0027s tough attitude on interest rates and expectations of earlier debt reduction (at a time when prices are soaring and output is stagnant) point to stagflation. Under such circumstances, the demand for inflation-resistant assets such as Bitcoin has further increased. At the same time, the SEC\u0027s approval of Bitcoin futures ETFs and the liberalization of crypto transactions in Russia, India, and other countries indicate that crypto investment is officially accepted by major capital markets under the background of gradual improvement of compliance. On this basis, some highly regulated institutional investors (such as pension funds) have also begun to consider participating in crypto-related transactions. It can be predicted that due to the persistence of a high inflation environment, with institutions from major capital markets extensively participating in crypto market-related businesses, the possibility that the good performance of the crypto market will continue to increase significantly until the end of the year. However, although the liquidity risk will not significantly affect the market in the short term, in the medium and long term, due to the general toughness of central banks in monetary policies, the risk of liquidity contraction is still one of the important threats to the future performance of the crypto market.",

    "title": "Lido Deep Dive: Everything You Need To Know by Flipside Crypto",
    "detailedContent": "By now, you’ve probably heard of Lido, known as the “liquid staking solution for Ethereum.” Since debuting earlier this year, users have diligently aped into the protocol, depositing more than $6.10 billion to it. A reenactment of users rushing into Lido this year The team behind Lido has also been hard at work expanding the protocol. They’ve already debuted new staking options to the platform in recent months in the form of LUNA and SOL in search of even more users. Lido developers expanding the protocol But what is liquid staking? 🤔 💧 🧐 And how does it let users double-dip yields? 🤯 💰💰 What’s the deal with stETH, bLUNA, stSOL, and LDO? 🪙 🪙 🪙 And why is everyone so damn excited about Lido? 🎉 🥳 📈 Let’s find out together. Lido \u003d Liquid Staking Lido describes itself as “an Ethereum-based liquid staking solution supported by leading blockchain staking providers.” It allows users to receive rewards for staking ETH, LUNA, or SOL. How does that relate to double-dipped yields? Well, Lido seeks to solve one of the major downsides to staking —namely the illiquidity, immovability, and inaccessibility of funds usually dedicated to staking. To do so, the protocol essentially enables users to double-dip on their tokens. Users can earn rewards in the form of stETH, bLUNA, and stSOL, while still allowing these tokens to be deployed across the DeFi ecosystem. Lido.fi Users can stake their tokens individually by running their own validator node or by delegating to a validator based on the size of their deposit. Rewards are distributed on a 1:1 basis representing their staked currency — ETH deposits are rewarded with stETH, LUNA deposits with bLUNA, and SOL deposits with stSOL. Each token can then be used to earn extra yield — aka be double dipped. That means more return on investment, so make sure your bags are ready. Double-yields \u003d more ROI What are stETH, bLUNA, stSOL, and LDO? StETH is a token that represents staked ETH in Lido, while bLUNA represents staked LUNA, and stSOL represents staked SOL. They are pegged 1:1 to the corresponding currency staked to the protocol, and balances are updated daily when oracles report changes in total stake. These tokens can be used largely the same as their partners, allowing users to earn staking rewards while still taking advantage of higher yields available across other DeFi protocols (there’s that double-dipping we were mentioning earlier.) LDO, meanwhile, is the governance token for the Lido DAO. The DAO oversees staking protocols, key parameters, and protocol upgrades. Holders are granted voting rights for each token they hold; more LDO means more voting power. Considering apeing into LDO? See LDO price information over the past month from CoinMarketCap below (but remember — this is not financial advice 😉).

    "summary": "This week, TokenInsight takes a look into what is going on with market expectations and fluctuations.",
    "title": "Crypto Bucks the Trend: Market Weekly Review from TokenInsight",
    "detailedContent": "This week, the momentum from within the crypto market and the macro anti-inflation demand became catalysts to push up asset prices, while the impact from regulation became insignificant. Judging from the relevant data on derivatives, the market expectation is obviously higher than last week, and the fluctuation is also relatively lower. Affected by persistent high inflation, investors\u0027 risk appetite is returning to anti-inflation assets, which may be one of the important reasons for the price of cryptos to return to a high level. High inflation, which is difficult to end in the short term, will further push investors to purchase high-yield anti-inflation assets. Mainstream Cryptos \"Back to Peak\" Unlike last month, the market in October was not affected by the expected liquidity crunch. Although the US dollar and US debt yields continued to strengthen, a large number of purchases from the crypto spot market significantly raised asset prices and brought the overall market value of the crypto market back to $2.28T, returning to the level of early September. In terms of trading volume, the daily trading volume of the spot market in early October continued to rise, from $36.82B to $80B on Oct 7. Buying by institutional investors played an important role: on Oct 6, block traders bought $1.6B of bitcoin spot in five minutes through market price orders. It is worth noting that although Huobi Exchange abandoned the Chinese market due to regulatory crackdown, its spot trading volume remained in the top 3 this week, with the highest turnover reaching $7.8B this week. At the same time, market speculation sentiment has dropped significantly. Historical volatility is one of the indicators to monitor market speculation sentiment. From the perspective of historical volatility, as of Oct 8, the daily historical volatility of BTC and ETH decreased by about 10% and 30% respectively compared with last week. From the perspective of options market performance, the implied volatility changes reflect that the options market, which is more concentrated by professional investors, has maintained a relatively stable attitude towards the rapid shift in the crypto market, but the trading of call options is the theme of this week. From Oct 1 to Oct 7, Bitcoin call options trading volume accounted for more than 70% of the total market share, and exceeded 80% at the highest point, which is rare throughout the year. Compared with Bitcoin, the share of Ethereum call options trading is slightly lower, but it also exceeds 60% most of the time. From the perspective of futures premiums, the recovery of market confidence is more obvious than last week. The \"gap\" of the term structure has been smoothed out, on the other hand, the premium of medium and long-term futures has risen significantly compared to last week. The above phenomena all show that investors have considerable bullish sentiment and are willing to pay more premiums to lock in future spot profits. Multiple Factors Push up Crypto Prices, Regulatory Impact is no Longer Significant In terms of supervision, the supervision of the crypto industry by major countries is being further improved with the arrival of October. South Korea\u0027s tax on cryptos is in progress. The European Central Bank is also trying to speed up the adoption of the MICA. in the United States, Coinbase has led the design of a draft regulatory framework for submission to lawmakers. And the US Department of Justice has established a national cryptocurrency enforcement team to address potential crimes in cryptocurrency transactions. From a global perspective, the IMF has issued a set of actionable policies for emerging markets and developing economies to ensure financial stability at a time when cryptocurrencies are adopted globally. In addition, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler said at a House hearing on Tuesday that the SEC has no plans to \"ban\" bitcoin and will not follow other countries in banning cryptocurrencies. He pointed out that the government\u0027s focus is to ensure that the industry complies with investor and consumer protection rules, anti-money laundering regulations and tax laws. On the macro side, the risk of market liquidity tightening has eased significantly, while a new round of liquidity flooding may be coming soon. The Fed\u0027s attitude to reducing liquidity has been repeated. Meister, chairman of the Cleveland Fed, said the Fed\u0027s forecast did not show a sharp rise in interest rates. The Fed\u0027s new strategy is that it will not act until the average inflation rate reaches 2% and basically completes some of its tasks. With US inflation still high above 5% and inflation expectations not falling in the short term, demand for inflation-resistant assets will effectively push up the price of cryptos. The European Central Bank is studying a new bond-buying program to prevent sharp market turbulence when its emergency bond-buying program expires next year. The new program does not yet set a ceiling for debt purchases, but it could be higher than the current $20 billion per month program. The release of liquidity in Europe, one of the main markets for trading cryptos, is expected to lead to a new wave of investment in cryptos. This week, due to the combined influence of persistently high inflation expectations, the uncertainty of the US debt ceiling policy, the statements of the Federal Reserve on liquidity contraction and the strengthening of internal activities in the crypto market, investors have begun to turn to cryptos despite the historically high US debt yields, and regulatory risks have become no longer significant under the strong demand of investors for cryptos. However, compared with September, the general clarity of regulatory boundaries and moderation of attitudes have reduced investors\u0027 risk expectations when investing in cryptos, which may be one of the reasons for the good performance of the crypto market in the first week of October. However, behind the high market rally, short-sellers are also stirring. On the CME exchange, short positions have increased significantly, while the large put options block trading with a size of more than 2500 BTC due on October 22 also indicate that the market may have downside risks from short-sellers and need to be treated with caution.

    "title": "Strong Buying Activity Propels Bitcoin Above $55k: A Data Perspective by IntoTheBlock",
    "detailedContent": "Powered by Every other week, IntoTheBlock brings you an on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. Strong Buying Activity Propels Bitcoin Above $55k Crypto markets have bounced back strongly, with Bitcoin, in particular, leading the way. Bitcoin has increased as much as 35% over the past seven days with Bitcoin dominance surpassing 45% for the first time in two months. The recent price run-up has been fueled by strong buying activity and positive trends in terms of expectations and on-chain data. In regards to news, many pointed to Brazil exploring legalizing Bitcoin as a method of payment. Brazil’s federal deputy Aureo Riveiro will be presenting a bill to the Chamber of Deputies this week, looking to follow the footsteps of El Salvador. While this is not yet confirmed, the proposal brought optimism into a market that was already pointing higher. Similarly, there is a lot of expectation developing around a Bitcoin ETF potentially being approved as early as this month. Although a decision on physically-backed Bitcoin ETFs was recently postponed, upcoming futures-backed ones appear to be better suited. Eric Balchunas, Senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg gives it a 75% chance that one of the four upcoming futures-backed ETFs gets approved. Source:Twitter While it is uncertain how much these developments are contributing to Bitcoin’s price action, the strong buying activity is undeniable. This is apparent both in the order book and on-chain indicators. As many will know, each trade on an order book has a market maker and a taker. Takers are the ones making market orders by buying at the ask or selling at the bid. High volume from takers in either direction tends to shift prices strongly as they take on the liquidity of the order book, pushing prices higher or lower. IntoTheBlock’s Trades per Side indicator displays the volume being transacted by takers, displaying buy volume as positive numbers and sell orders as negative. Throughout Wednesday morning (EST) it became evident that there was strong buying action taking place, particularly in Binance. As of October 6 using IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin order book indicators Within a minute over 600 BTC was acquired by takers in Binance in two separate instances, highlighting the bullish conviction behind the recent price action. Diving into on-chain activity we also observe strong buying with the number of addresses holding one or more Bitcoin continuously growing throughout the past few months. As of October 6 using IntoTheBlock’s upcoming ownership v2 indicators After dropping significantly in Q2 2021, the number of addresses holding 1 or more Bitcoin has steadily climbed. This signals an accumulation from holders looking to reach 1 BTC and highlights their conviction in the recent surge in price as this number has kept increasing. Given the increasing momentum behind Bitcoin, it is worth taking a look at the next levels that are expected to act as support and resistance. Based on IntoTheBlock’s In/Out of the Money Around Price we can determine price levels around which buying activity has been previously concentrated. Using this, we can anticipate resistance from sellers around the $58,000 price range. As of October 6 using IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin financial indicators 790,000 addresses previously acquired nearly 300k BTC just around $58,000, which makes this the largest cluster of buying activity above the current price. Previous buyers may look to break-even on their positions around this range. Beyond this price level, however, there is little to no resistance expected to prevent new all-time highs. Conversely, if prices were to fall significantly, strong support is expected above $50,000, where 670,000 addresses bought 416k BTC. There is also some buying activity around $54,000 which could act as a significant level for buyers eager to accumulate. Overall, sentiment for Bitcoin has turned positive by many metrics. Strong buying activity is witnessed both in market data and on-chain analytics. Moreover, Bitcoin’s correlation with traditional markets has dropped to near-zero, making it less prone to the recent weakness in stock markets. However, the strong anticipation for both the approval of a Bitcoin ETF in the US and a Brazilian “Bitcoin standard” could act as a roadblock if they don’t go through. Ultimately, though, consensus remains bullish for Bitcoin over the short term.

    "summary": "Continuing to explore the world of Ethereum bridges with Flipside Crypto analyst Aadharsh Pannirselvam.",
    "title": "Bridges of Ethereum County: Flipside Crypto",
    "detailedContent": "Bridges are a crucial part of the blockchain ecosystem. As Flipside Crypto analyst @aadharsh2010 pointed out, in last week’s Our Network newsletter, analyzing trends across both directions of these bridges offers a deeper view into DeFi users\u0027 decision-making. Axie Infinity’s Ronin Bridge, for instance, leads the way in the number of transactions. The Terra Bridge, meanwhile, has increased engagement on the Terra network since its launch in March. The same relationship between news interest and traffic/interactive addresses has applied to Solana’s Sollet Bridge in the wake of a massive wave of public interest in Solana. But as @aadharsh2010 notes below, some bridges are inherently more complicated than others. How Bridge Architecture Impacts Transactions The graph below shows that there is only one address that sends transactions to the Matic Ether Bridge’s smart contract. The Matic Ether contract, meanwhile, sends tokens to several addresses. As the chain of contracts that a transaction is routed through is fully represented by a single transaction ID, reading the origin address sidesteps the issue from the previous graph. How Routers Led to the Thorchain Hack As noted here, Thorchain’s ETH router was the point of contact for the July 9 whitehat hack (as well as the later hacks). It appears as though the first hack prompted a partial change in router (as well as some security changes). This change lasted until Thorchain shut down for further security changes. RenBridge as a Counterexample What’s interesting to note about RenBridge is the symmetry with regard to the direction taken across the bridge. In this case, this symmetry occurs because bridge transactions need to be routed to the genesis address to control the mint/release events for renTokens. These tokens are then given to the same address and are considered as valuable as the inputted assets. Conclusions As a whole, it’s clear that bridge traffic and volume increase in both directions with hype and price fluctuations. What remains to be seen is how bridges will continue to exist in a world where every blockchain is inherently built to communicate with one another. There’s legitimate reason for debate regarding the net benefit of cross-chain networking, even if it has put a spotlight on fledgling chains and allowed innovative concepts to spread. There does exist a possibility that bridging and total interoperability in blockchains can lead to a future where the failure of one protocol or blockchain lacks isolation. This could result in legitimate market shocks across the DeFi space. This article contains links to third-party websites or other content for information purposes only (“Third-Party Sites”).

    "title": "Columbus-5 Is Almost Here — What Does That Mean For Terra and Its Users: Flipside Crypto",
    "detailedContent": "Changes are coming to the Terra blockchain — BIG changes. In fact, according to the Terra Twitter account itself, it’s going to be “Terra’s most significant mainnet upgrade yet.” The mainnet upgrade known as Columbus-5 will be deployed later this week, at roughly 3:30 AM UTC on Sept. 30 (11:30 PM EST on Sept. 29). The upgrade has been some time coming, as it was originally planned for Sept. 9 before being delayed to later the same month. According to a Twitter thread from Terra, this was done “to implement some extra precautionary measures for the rollout.” So, before it arrives later this week, let’s take a closer look at what the upgrade will mean for Terra, the #LUNAtics and other Terra users, and the protocols that call it home. Columbus-5 — What Is It and What Will It Bring? There are three main changes that Columbus-5 brings: an upgrade to Stargate and the integration of IBC protocol, the integration of Ozone and Wormhole, and a new burn policy. Each one will carry major implications for the Terra ecosystem. Burn, Baby, Burn Perhaps the most notable part of the upgrade for many retail investors and speculators is the decision to burn all seigniorage. Previously, seigniorage, or LUNA burned to mint UST, was diverted to a community pool that was used for oracle rewards and eventually became overfunded. After the deployment, this LUNA will instead be burned, which is designed to increase the value of the currency and give more rewards to LUNA stakers. Upgrading to Stargate This is one of the biggest changes brought on by Columbus-5. Upgrading to Stargate will enable integration of the Inter Blockchain Communication protocol, or IBC, which provides support for a large collection of interchain use cases. This will make UST the go-to stablecoin for networks like Cosmos, expanding the use case of Terra to more than 250 unique dapps. Welcome, Ozone + Wormhole Columbus-5 will also see the introduction of Ozone and Wormhole. Ozone, a coverage protocol designed by Terraform Labs, is designed to lock up and secure a significant share of UST, providing insurance for projects built by TFL. Wormhole, meanwhile, is a bridge between Terra and Solana that will enable the movement of UST between the two networks. This should allow further integration and collaboration between Terra and Solana projects. How Will Columbus-5 Affect Users? First, and foremost, users should know to stay away from Terra and its associated protocols and projects during the upgrade later this week. Attempting to complete any transactions could result in funds being lost for good. But what about after the upgrade has been deployed? Well, for one thing, the changes outlined above have made Columbus-5 a hotly anticipated update across the #LUNAtic and wider Terra community. In fact, many are anticipating a rally in the price of $LUNA to follow the arrival of Columbus-5. LUNA stakers will also likely see staking rewards grow thanks to the new burning of seigniorage. The arrival of Columbus-5 also means that a horde of new protocols and going projects will be going live this week. Once the upgrade is officially deployed, more than 50 protocols will soon be live and accessible to users. These protocols will cover everything from existing applications like savings accounts and mirrored assets to new use cases like investment dashboards, NFT creation and sales, derivatives, and more. Check out a full list of protocols and more information on these projects in this Twitter thread from @FynnToTheMoon or this thread from @FastGameCrypto.",

    "title": "An Overleveraged Crypto Market Leads to a 20% Drop: A Data Perspective by IntoTheBlock",
    "detailedContent": "Every other week, IntoTheBlock brings you on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. An Overleveraged Crypto Market Leads to a 20% Drop In the morning of Sept. 7, crypto market sentiment was positive overall: El Salvador officially began to apply their Bitcoin law recognizing Bitcoin as a legal tender. The previous price action candles were bullish at a steady place in what seemed like the farewell to the $50K band price for Bitcoin, but in a matter of hours, all of the crypto market started to sell-off significantly. The crypto market capitalization dropped -20% from $2.37T to $1.97T in barely 12 hours. It quickly after recovered to around $2.0T, where it is at the time of writing, so the plunge accounts so far for a -15% over the last 24 hours. The price fall affected Bitcoin and Ethereum similarly. As of Sept. 8, based on IntoTheBlock’s capital markets insights. While the price fall for Bitcoin was as much as -19% (from $53K to $43K), for Ethereum it accounted for -23% (from $3.9K to $3.0K). The bounce and quick price recovery was 11% for Bitcoin, while 18% for Ethereum. Taking into account these bounces and the last price action data, at the time of writing these price reductions are -14% for Bitcoin and -15% for Ethereum. Even after these drops, Ethereum’s 11.26% price increase in a month-over-month performance is outpacing Bitcoin, which sits around a 5.48% price increase. This data shows that — besides Ethereum being a more volatile asset than Bitcoin — its recent price performance is still better than Bitcoin, even when the market drops considerably. As for market sell-offs, even though they come often in the crypto market, this one did not even turn the month-over-month return negative, and prices are lingering around last week’s levels. Despite some news attributing the price crash to a “buy the rumor, sell the news” strategy due to El Salvador’s law, the data shows that the market was heavily leveraged and some market sell orders unleashed a liquidations cascade on long orders on futures derivatives markets, which exacerbated the price fall considerably. According to Bybit liquidation data, more than $3B has been liquidated in derivatives positions, more than 92% being long positions. Most of those $3B were in Bitcoin ($1.42B), while the other liquidations were notably in Ethereum ($949M) and Ripple ($225M). This is the biggest number of liquidations since the May 19 crash. Using IntoTheBlock data, it can be appreciated how the open interest in perpetual futures derivatives — which is the dollar amount of open positions —has decreased from $16.5B to $11.75B for Bitcoin. These positions usually involve high amounts of leverage. As of Sept. 8, based on IntoTheBlock’s capital markets insights. A reduction in open interest is partially due to liquidations forcing certain positions to close, but also due to traders who decide to close their positions without the need for them to have been liquidated — an action that is expected when the market starts to see high levels of volatility. Open interest data can be put into context by comparing it with the market capitalization of the coin. In this way, a ratio can be obtained that takes into account perpetual futures activity relative to the value of all the coins in circulation. This is the ratio of perpetual swaps open interest to Bitcoin’s market cap, which had been rising, as too many people had bullish leverage positions. In the next chart, it can be seen that when the open interest notional value has been greater than 1.55%, the market has reversed and rapid price action has followed. As of Sept. 8, based on IntoTheBlock’s capital markets insights. Did investors take advantage and buy the dip this time? The exchange flows indicator highlights trends of traders sending money in and out of exchanges. Net flows are positive when more funds are entering than leaving exchanges, and net flows are negative when a greater volume is being withdrawn from exchanges. As it can be seen on Sept. 6, the total balance of Bitcoin that left exchanges was more than the amount entering the exchanges by 8.3K BTC, which is around $428M. This means that many traders and investors took the advantage to buy Bitcoin and send it from centralized exchange to wallet addresses, which supposedly minimizes further selling pressure since the coins need to be located in exchange addresses for them to be able to be sold. As of Sept. 8, based on IntoTheBlock’s capital markets insights. Despite the quick bounce after the sell-off showing conviction by traders, the Sept. 7 price action is not overwhelmingly bullish so far and further price discounts would not be anything surprising. Historically, September has been the month with the worst returns on average for the crypto markets. Overall, this data analysis teaches the lesson that the derivatives market continues to rule the price action for the crypto markets. Furthermore, traders — especially those that use leverage — should consider proceeding with caution when open interest achieves higher and higher amounts and the price continues to grow for several days in a row without some meaningful correction.

    "title": "Quarterly Delivery, US Dollar Strengthening: Weekly Market Review From TokenInsight",
    "detailedContent": "This week, mainstream cryptos were greatly affected by liquidity factors. Before the FOMC meeting in September, concerns about shrinking liquidity caused a large number of investors to \"withdraw\" from the crypto market, triggering huge market volatility. But considering that it coincides with quarterly derivatives delivery, market volatility is still in the normal range. The size of derivatives delivery in this quarter even slightly exceeded the semi-annual delivery size on Jun 25. Take the options market as an example, the size of options delivered on September 24 is estimated to be no less than $4.712B. The Fed\u0027s interest rate resolution on Thursday eased market tensions and market volatility fell significantly after that. However, considering that US regulators will impose stricter regulatory measures on cryptos in the future and the fact that the marginal contraction of liquidity has begun, the future trend of US dollar liquidity will dominate the market trend in the short and medium term. Before and After Quarterly Delivery: Liquidity Changes Triggered a Sharp Market Shock Since Sep 20, affected by the exodus of market liquidity, the crypto market has once again experienced a sharp downward shock. Bitcoin prices were once below $40,000, and market volatility has jumped due to the combined impact of liquidity changes and the approaching delivery of derivatives. However, from the overall data in Sep, since the sharp drop around Sep 7 has reduced the leverage level of the market to a certain extent, the large-scale exodus of liquidity around Sep 20 did not actually have an excessive impact. From the perspective of implied volatility, the market confidence of professional investors is still relatively strong. Judging from the turnover in the derivatives market, the delivery pressure has been released around Sep 20-22, so the turnover of derivatives on the delivery day is actually not high. As of 15:00 (UTC + 8) on Sep 24, the turnover of perpetual contracts is about $74.3B, of which the trading volume in Binance exchange is about $33.5B, and the trading volume of perpetual contracts on exchanges such as Huobi and Bybit are all around $6B. It is worth noting that Huobi\u0027s intra-exchange perpetual contract positions have recovered. Compared with the last quarterly closing, Huobi\u0027s intra-exchange positions have recovered to about $1.4B, up about 27.3% from the end of the previous quarter. However, from the perspective of skewness and futures premium term structure, the market attitude is still generally cautious. The skewness of mainstream cryptos continues to be negative in the near future, while the October futures products premiums are generally less than 4%, on the edge of negative premium, while the market forward futures premium is relatively stable. Liquidity Contraction Expected to Strengthen, Regulatory Pressure Surged This week, institutional activities had relatively little impact on crypto prices, while regulatory pressure on the crypto market rose sharply again after May. In East Asia, the People\u0027s Bank of China issued a \"Notice on Further Preventing and Handling the Risk of Speculation in Virtual Currency Trading\", which mentioned that overseas crypto exchanges providing services to residents in China through the Internet are also illegal financial activities, and staff providing marketing promotion, payment and settlement, technical support and other services will also be investigated for relevant responsibilities according to law. In addition, South Korea will close more than 40 exchanges that do not meet regulatory requirements on Sep 25. Strong regulation in East Asia may push up market risk aversion, but considering that the volume of transactions from the Asian region has dropped significantly since May, regulatory risks have been basically cleared, and the influence of regulation from the Asian region on the crypto market in the future will be relatively limited. In the US, SEC Chairman Gensler said on Tuesday that the SEC has \"strong\" authority to regulate cryptocurrencies, congress can help regulate stable currencies, and the US Treasury Department said it would impose more sanctions on cryptocurrency services that help illegal practices, with crypto platforms such as \"nested exchanges\", \"hybrid exchanges\" and \"peer-to-peer\" receiving priority attention. In addition, US President Biden plans to nominate Omarova, a law professor who has criticized cryptocurrencies and advocated a greater role for the government in the banking industry, to head the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The US House of Representatives has passed the 2021 defence budget bill, which includes provisions related to cryptocurrencies. It is understood that the defence budget bill usually has broad bipartisan support in the US and is regarded as a must-pass bill. However, the provisions related to cryptocurrencies in the bill may soon be incorporated into law. The bill is currently awaiting Senate approval. At the same time, the proposed bill will require the US Securities Regulatory Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to clearly define which institution supervises which aspects of the crypto market. In addition, Congress will establish a working group composed of representatives of the SEC and CFTC within 90 days of the passage of the bill. There is no doubt that the deflection of US regulatory wind may further promote the outflow of liquidity from the crypto market. Although the Fed\u0027s interest rate resolution on September 24 has not yet released the details of Taper and kept interest rates unchanged, the liquidity contraction has actually begun: the Federal Reserve accepted $1.35T in fixed-rate reverse repos, continuing to brush a record high for five consecutive days. The New York Federal Reserve raised the limit for counterparties in the overnight reverse repos to US $160 billion on Sep 24. At the same time, UK interest rate futures prices show that the Bank of England is slightly more than 80% likely to raise interest rates by 15 basis points by February 2022. Under this influence, US Treasury yields have risen sharply. Although the liquidity contraction will not have a significant impact in the short term, the strength of low-risk assets such as the US dollar under the liquidity contraction will change investors\u0027 risk appetite in the medium and long term, and the liquidity outflow pressure in the crypto market may continue.

    "summary": "Flipside Crypto takes a look into what is going on with Polygon transactions.",
    "title": "The Money Making Machine Behind the Polygon Spam Attacks",
    "detailedContent": "Since May, there’s been a lot of talk about Polygon “flipping” Ethereum — at first in terms of transaction count (at its peak, there were 8M transactions per day happening on Polygon, compared to 1.2M TPD on Ethereum) and just last week in terms of active user count — rising to a record high of 566,516 active addresses on Saturday, surpassing Ethereum for the first time. However, it’s also been reported in a Polygon forum that the network has been under a spam attack since May, which has been inflating network utilization numbers by 90%. Every block was full of users sending meaningless transactions and just paying for the gas fees. With 1 gwei in gas price, or 0.000000001 MATIC / gas, and a 20 million gas limit per block, it only costs around 0.02 MATIC to spam an entire block on Polygon, or $1,000 for an entire day. So it’s cheap to flood a whole block — but still, what’s the incentive? This article sheds light on the mechanism happening behind these spam transactions, and the profits at stake. Our research suggests that increasing gas fees to 30 gwei could be very effective in this case. Access Polygon data here The Arbitrage Bot Behind these Spam Attacks Identifying the Sender On average, the top 10 DApps in terms of weekly transaction count add up to 3 million transactions per week, or 420k transactions per day. With 4M-6M transactions happening on the whole network daily, the top 10 applications account for less than 10% of the total network - so where are the rest of the transactions coming from? With a simple query we were able to find the top 10 addresses in terms of total transactions. The top two contracts, “0xa81ce04168e41a47f68a975d67a00fbef729af9b” and “0x84e5bc3df0df0f543648f250443c6f4077218312,” have been interacting with 2 million transactions daily — which accounts for roughly 30% of the network’s total transaction count. Source: Polygon dashboard Looking at the details of their transactions, we can see that these two contracts are arbitrage bots. They are the target of millions of transactions every day, and initiate thousands of daily transactions to DEXes themselves. Identifying the Recipient Source: Transaction For example, in the above trade, this contract sent out 0.153 MATIC worth 0.23$ and receive back 4.33 MATIC worth 6.5$ An arbitrage bot is a bot that captures the different exchange rates between platforms to make profit. For example, if Uniswap has 3700$ / ETH and Sushi has 3600$ / ETH, you can simultaneously buy on Sushi and sell on Uniswap to capture the 100$ difference. We now have the full picture: spam attack transactions act as the trigger for these arbitrage bots to make their own transactions on DEXes. By plotting the total transactions sent out by these bot contracts, we can see that they make around 2,000 – 4,000 transactions per day, which is nothing unusual. Source: Polygon dashboard We don’t know the contract’s code so we cannot explain why it needs so many input transactions versus just 2,000–4,000 trades per day. The likely theory is that the owner just wants to spam the contract so others cannot front-run the real trade. So someone has a bot that floods a block with noise to protect from front running, as opposed to using priority fees to ensure they are always first in the block. But is it really cheaper to buy a whole block than to just pay exorbitant prices to be first? How much is this spammer making? By tracking the contract creator we can see that the bot was initially funded with 14 ETH (~$3,775) and made multiple transactions back for a total of 218.5 ETH (equivalent to ~$825,000 at the time of writing) that was bridged back to Ethereum. That’s an average of $6,800 a day in profits over the past 120 days — which is how long the bot has been running. Increasing Transaction Fees On Oct. 5, 2021, the network’s co-founder recommended increasing the minimum transaction fee from 1 gwei to 30 gwei - raising the cost of spamming an entire day to $30,000 to disincentivize spam transactions from happening. Shortly after the adjustment, the spam transactions dropped 75% from 2M to just 500k TPD. Polygon’s daily transactions also dropped 50% from 6M to just over 3M TPD. This is clearly shown in the graph above. As shown in the graph above, the network’s utilization rate also dropped down from 90% back to 60% which is a healthier rate. This leaves a lot of room for others to build on Polygon. It’s worth noting that even with the 75% drop, spam transactions still account for 16.7% of the network’s daily transactions. This means bots are still spending around $5,000 a day at the current gas price, or 83% of their daily profit, to keep this operation going.

    "title": "The Shadow of \"Stagflation\" Spreads Many Countries, Investment Institutions Increase Crypto Investments: Weekly Market Review From TokenInsight",
    "detailedContent": "The performance of the crypto market has reached a new high since June. The main reasons are the persistence of high inflation expectations in many countries, the strengthening of \"stagflation\" risks, and the SEC\u0027s notice of no objection to Bitcoin futures ETFs. Bitcoin futures ETFs have been notified by the SEC of no objection, which means that the world\u0027s largest capital market is officially open to cryptos, and the biggest regulatory risks have been eliminated in the short term, clearing the way for mainstream institutions to enter the market. Under the influence of the temporary increase of the US debt ceiling, the high market risk appetite, and the endorsement of institutions entering the market, US debt and US dollar both fell. Although many central banks have released the news of bringing forward interest rate hikes, the high inflation pressure shows that the overall liquidity of the market is expected to remain at a high level for a long time. The Bull Market Is Still Continuing After a short trough, the crypto market entered an explosive phase this week. In terms of market value, as of 4:00 UTC on Oct. 15, the market value of the whole market has risen to $2.45T and is about to approach an all-time high ($2.54T). From the perspective of volatility, the market volatility difference continued to expand this week, while the implied volatility was higher than the realized volatility, indicating that the market is stable in the bull market stage, and there is no sign of decline. From the perspective of skewness, market expectations have risen in the short term, but the medium and long-term expectations have not changed much compared with last week. An important reason is that a large number of professional investors have turned to bulls since the beginning of August. From the perspective of the futures term structure, on the one hand, the bullish sentiment in the derivatives market is obvious, and the overall premium of futures has risen to a new high since May. On the other hand, the premium of forwarding futures term structure on major futures exchanges has obviously declined, indicating that although investors are optimistic, they are not going to pay more premium for the future due to worries about the risk of monetary policy tightening and macro liquidity contraction. Anti-Inflationary Demand: the Source of the Bull Market The outstanding performance of the crypto market this week is inseparable from changes in the macro-environment. On Oct. 13, the September CPI in the United States was announced, in which the inflation rate was reported to be 5.4%, higher than market expectations, and much higher than the 2% target set by the Federal Reserve. In contrast, the non-agricultural index, which reflects the economic growth situation, hit a new low. Considering that high inflation of more than 5% has lasted for half a year, investors have insufficient confidence in the Fed to reduce inflation. Economic growth is still lower than expected, indicating that the stimulus to the economy by releasing liquidity has not had enough effect. Affected by this, institutional investors are turning to stocks, commodities, and cryptos to hedge inflation risks. In addition, a number of macro indicators show that the risk of \"stagflation\" is increasing. Under the pressure of flooded liquidity, developed country economies such as South Korea and New Zealand have responded by raising interest rates, while the UK has also indicated that it may raise interest rates earlier than December. The divergence between the US Institute for Supply Management\u0027s (ISM) manufacturing production index and the price index, and the US 10-year Treasury yield exceeded 1.61% on October 11 despite the increase in real yields, may confirm the threat of stagflation. OPEC\u0027s slow and steady production growth may pose a serious inflation threat and have a counterproductive impact on oil demand. The Federal Reserve is facing concerns about inflation risks and stagnant economic growth, but the Fed\u0027s tough attitude on interest rates and expectations of earlier debt reduction (at a time when prices are soaring and output is stagnant) point to stagflation. Under such circumstances, the demand for inflation-resistant assets such as Bitcoin has further increased. At the same time, the SEC\u0027s approval of Bitcoin futures ETFs and the liberalization of crypto transactions in Russia, India, and other countries indicate that crypto investment is officially accepted by major capital markets under the background of gradual improvement of compliance. On this basis, some highly regulated institutional investors (such as pension funds) have also begun to consider participating in crypto-related transactions. It can be predicted that due to the persistence of a high inflation environment, with institutions from major capital markets extensively participating in crypto market-related businesses, the possibility that the good performance of the crypto market will continue to increase significantly until the end of the year. However, although the liquidity risk will not significantly affect the market in the short term, in the medium and long term, due to the general toughness of central banks in monetary policies, the risk of liquidity contraction is still one of the important threats to the future performance of the crypto market.",

    "title": "Lido Deep Dive: Everything You Need To Know by Flipside Crypto",
    "detailedContent": "By now, you’ve probably heard of Lido, known as the “liquid staking solution for Ethereum.” Since debuting earlier this year, users have diligently aped into the protocol, depositing more than $6.10 billion to it. A reenactment of users rushing into Lido this year The team behind Lido has also been hard at work expanding the protocol. They’ve already debuted new staking options to the platform in recent months in the form of LUNA and SOL in search of even more users. Lido developers expanding the protocol But what is liquid staking? 🤔 💧 🧐 And how does it let users double-dip yields? 🤯 💰💰 What’s the deal with stETH, bLUNA, stSOL, and LDO? 🪙 🪙 🪙 And why is everyone so damn excited about Lido? 🎉 🥳 📈 Let’s find out together. Lido \u003d Liquid Staking Lido describes itself as “an Ethereum-based liquid staking solution supported by leading blockchain staking providers.” It allows users to receive rewards for staking ETH, LUNA, or SOL. How does that relate to double-dipped yields? Well, Lido seeks to solve one of the major downsides to staking —namely the illiquidity, immovability, and inaccessibility of funds usually dedicated to staking. To do so, the protocol essentially enables users to double-dip on their tokens. Users can earn rewards in the form of stETH, bLUNA, and stSOL, while still allowing these tokens to be deployed across the DeFi ecosystem. Lido.fi Users can stake their tokens individually by running their own validator node or by delegating to a validator based on the size of their deposit. Rewards are distributed on a 1:1 basis representing their staked currency — ETH deposits are rewarded with stETH, LUNA deposits with bLUNA, and SOL deposits with stSOL. Each token can then be used to earn extra yield — aka be double dipped. That means more return on investment, so make sure your bags are ready. Double-yields \u003d more ROI What are stETH, bLUNA, stSOL, and LDO? StETH is a token that represents staked ETH in Lido, while bLUNA represents staked LUNA, and stSOL represents staked SOL. They are pegged 1:1 to the corresponding currency staked to the protocol, and balances are updated daily when oracles report changes in total stake. These tokens can be used largely the same as their partners, allowing users to earn staking rewards while still taking advantage of higher yields available across other DeFi protocols (there’s that double-dipping we were mentioning earlier.) LDO, meanwhile, is the governance token for the Lido DAO. The DAO oversees staking protocols, key parameters, and protocol upgrades. Holders are granted voting rights for each token they hold; more LDO means more voting power. Considering apeing into LDO?

    "title": "Crypto Bucks the Trend: Market Weekly Review from TokenInsight",
    "detailedContent": "This week, the momentum from within the crypto market and the macro anti-inflation demand became catalysts to push up asset prices, while the impact from regulation became insignificant. Judging from the relevant data on derivatives, the market expectation is obviously higher than last week, and the fluctuation is also relatively lower. Affected by persistent high inflation, investors\u0027 risk appetite is returning to anti-inflation assets, which may be one of the important reasons for the price of cryptos to return to a high level. High inflation, which is difficult to end in the short term, will further push investors to purchase high-yield anti-inflation assets. Mainstream Cryptos \"Back to Peak\" Unlike last month, the market in October was not affected by the expected liquidity crunch. Although the US dollar and US debt yields continued to strengthen, a large number of purchases from the crypto spot market significantly raised asset prices and brought the overall market value of the crypto market back to $2.28T, returning to the level of early September. In terms of trading volume, the daily trading volume of the spot market in early October continued to rise, from $36.82B to $80B on Oct 7. Buying by institutional investors played an important role: on Oct 6, block traders bought $1.6B of bitcoin spot in five minutes through market price orders. It is worth noting that although Huobi Exchange abandoned the Chinese market due to regulatory crackdown, its spot trading volume remained in the top 3 this week, with the highest turnover reaching $7.8B this week. At the same time, market speculation sentiment has dropped significantly. Historical volatility is one of the indicators to monitor market speculation sentiment. From the perspective of historical volatility, as of Oct 8, the daily historical volatility of BTC and ETH decreased by about 10% and 30% respectively compared with last week. From the perspective of options market performance, the implied volatility changes reflect that the options market, which is more concentrated by professional investors, has maintained a relatively stable attitude towards the rapid shift in the crypto market, but the trading of call options is the theme of this week. From Oct 1 to Oct 7, Bitcoin call options trading volume accounted for more than 70% of the total market share, and exceeded 80% at the highest point, which is rare throughout the year. Compared with Bitcoin, the share of Ethereum call options trading is slightly lower, but it also exceeds 60% most of the time. From the perspective of futures premiums, the recovery of market confidence is more obvious than last week. The \"gap\" of the term structure has been smoothed out, on the other hand, the premium of medium and long-term futures has risen significantly compared to last week. The above phenomena all show that investors have considerable bullish sentiment and are willing to pay more premiums to lock in future spot profits. Multiple Factors Push up Crypto Prices, Regulatory Impact is no Longer Significant In terms of supervision, the supervision of the crypto industry by major countries is being further improved with the arrival of October. South Korea\u0027s tax on cryptos is in progress. The European Central Bank is also trying to speed up the adoption of the MICA. in the United States, Coinbase has led the design of a draft regulatory framework for submission to lawmakers. And the US Department of Justice has established a national cryptocurrency enforcement team to address potential crimes in cryptocurrency transactions. From a global perspective, the IMF has issued a set of actionable policies for emerging markets and developing economies to ensure financial stability at a time when cryptocurrencies are adopted globally. In addition, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler said at a House hearing on Tuesday that the SEC has no plans to \"ban\" bitcoin and will not follow other countries in banning cryptocurrencies. He pointed out that the government\u0027s focus is to ensure that the industry complies with investor and consumer protection rules, anti-money laundering regulations and tax laws. On the macro side, the risk of market liquidity tightening has eased significantly, while a new round of liquidity flooding may be coming soon. The Fed\u0027s attitude to reducing liquidity has been repeated. Meister, chairman of the Cleveland Fed, said the Fed\u0027s forecast did not show a sharp rise in interest rates. The Fed\u0027s new strategy is that it will not act until the average inflation rate reaches 2% and basically completes some of its tasks. With US inflation still high above 5% and inflation expectations not falling in the short term, demand for inflation-resistant assets will effectively push up the price of cryptos. The European Central Bank is studying a new bond-buying program to prevent sharp market turbulence when its emergency bond-buying program expires next year. The new program does not yet set a ceiling for debt purchases, but it could be higher than the current $20 billion per month program. The release of liquidity in Europe, one of the main markets for trading cryptos, is expected to lead to a new wave of investment in cryptos. This week, due to the combined influence of persistently high inflation expectations, the uncertainty of the US debt ceiling policy, the statements of the Federal Reserve on liquidity contraction and the strengthening of internal activities in the crypto market, investors have begun to turn to cryptos despite the historically high US debt yields, and regulatory risks have become no longer significant under the strong demand of investors for cryptos. However, compared with September, the general clarity of regulatory boundaries and moderation of attitudes have reduced investors\u0027 risk expectations when investing in cryptos, which may be one of the reasons for the good performance of the crypto market in the first week of October. However, behind the high market rally, short-sellers are also stirring. On the CME exchange, short positions have increased significantly, while the large put options block trading with a size of more than 2500 BTC due on October 22 also indicate that the market may have downside risks from short-sellers and need to be treated with caution.

    "title": "Strong Buying Activity Propels Bitcoin Above $55k: A Data Perspective by IntoTheBlock",
    "detailedContent": "Powered by Every other week, IntoTheBlock brings you an on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. Strong Buying Activity Propels Bitcoin Above $55k Crypto markets have bounced back strongly, with Bitcoin, in particular, leading the way. Bitcoin has increased as much as 35% over the past seven days with Bitcoin dominance surpassing 45% for the first time in two months. The recent price run-up has been fueled by strong buying activity and positive trends in terms of expectations and on-chain data. In regards to news, many pointed to Brazil exploring legalizing Bitcoin as a method of payment. Brazil’s federal deputy Aureo Riveiro will be presenting a bill to the Chamber of Deputies this week, looking to follow the footsteps of El Salvador. While this is not yet confirmed, the proposal brought optimism into a market that was already pointing higher. Similarly, there is a lot of expectation developing around a Bitcoin ETF potentially being approved as early as this month. Although a decision on physically-backed Bitcoin ETFs was recently postponed, upcoming futures-backed ones appear to be better suited. Eric Balchunas, Senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg gives it a 75% chance that one of the four upcoming futures-backed ETFs gets approved. Source:Twitter While it is uncertain how much these developments are contributing to Bitcoin’s price action, the strong buying activity is undeniable. This is apparent both in the order book and on-chain indicators. As many will know, each trade on an order book has a market maker and a taker. Takers are the ones making market orders by buying at the ask or selling at the bid. High volume from takers in either direction tends to shift prices strongly as they take on the liquidity of the order book, pushing prices higher or lower. IntoTheBlock’s Trades per Side indicator displays the volume being transacted by takers, displaying buy volume as positive numbers and sell orders as negative. Throughout Wednesday morning (EST) it became evident that there was strong buying action taking place, particularly in Binance. As of October 6 using IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin order book indicators Within a minute over 600 BTC was acquired by takers in Binance in two separate instances, highlighting the bullish conviction behind the recent price action. Diving into on-chain activity we also observe strong buying with the number of addresses holding one or more Bitcoin continuously growing throughout the past few months. As of October 6 using IntoTheBlock’s upcoming ownership v2 indicators After dropping significantly in Q2 2021, the number of addresses holding 1 or more Bitcoin has steadily climbed. This signals an accumulation from holders looking to reach 1 BTC and highlights their conviction in the recent surge in price as this number has kept increasing. Given the increasing momentum behind Bitcoin, it is worth taking a look at the next levels that are expected to act as support and resistance. Based on IntoTheBlock’s In/Out of the Money Around Price we can determine price levels around which buying activity has been previously concentrated. Using this, we can anticipate resistance from sellers around the $58,000 price range. As of October 6 using IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin financial indicators 790,000 addresses previously acquired nearly 300k BTC just around $58,000, which makes this the largest cluster of buying activity above the current price. Previous buyers may look to break-even on their positions around this range. Beyond this price level, however, there is little to no resistance expected to prevent new all-time highs. Conversely, if prices were to fall significantly, strong support is expected above $50,000, where 670,000 addresses bought 416k BTC. There is also some buying activity around $54,000 which could act as a significant level for buyers eager to accumulate. Overall, sentiment for Bitcoin has turned positive by many metrics. Strong buying activity is witnessed both in market data and on-chain analytics. Moreover, Bitcoin’s correlation with traditional markets has dropped to near-zero, making it less prone to the recent weakness in stock markets. However, the strong anticipation for both the approval of a Bitcoin ETF in the US and a Brazilian “Bitcoin standard” could act as a roadblock if they don’t go through. Ultimately, though, consensus remains bullish for Bitcoin over the short term.

    "summary": "Continuing to explore the world of Ethereum bridges with Flipside Crypto analyst Aadharsh Pannirselvam.",
    "title": "Bridges of Ethereum County: Flipside Crypto",
    "detailedContent": "Bridges are a crucial part of the blockchain ecosystem. As Flipside Crypto analyst @aadharsh2010 pointed out, in last week’s Our Network newsletter, analyzing trends across both directions of these bridges offers a deeper view into DeFi users\u0027 decision-making. Axie Infinity’s Ronin Bridge, for instance, leads the way in the number of transactions. The Terra Bridge, meanwhile, has increased engagement on the Terra network since its launch in March. The same relationship between news interest and traffic/interactive addresses has applied to Solana’s Sollet Bridge in the wake of a massive wave of public interest in Solana. But as @aadharsh2010 notes below, some bridges are inherently more complicated than others. How Bridge Architecture Impacts Transactions The graph below shows that there is only one address that sends transactions to the Matic Ether Bridge’s smart contract. The Matic Ether contract, meanwhile, sends tokens to several addresses. As the chain of contracts that a transaction is routed through is fully represented by a single transaction ID, reading the origin address sidesteps the issue from the previous graph. How Routers Led to the Thorchain Hack As noted here, Thorchain’s ETH router was the point of contact for the July 9 whitehat hack (as well as the later hacks). It appears as though the first hack prompted a partial change in router (as well as some security changes). This change lasted until Thorchain shut down for further security changes. RenBridge as a Counterexample What’s interesting to note about RenBridge is the symmetry with regard to the direction taken across the bridge. In this case, this symmetry occurs because bridge transactions need to be routed to the genesis address to control the mint/release events for renTokens. These tokens are then given to the same address and are considered as valuable as the inputted assets. Conclusions As a whole, it’s clear that bridge traffic and volume increase in both directions with hype and price fluctuations. What remains to be seen is how bridges will continue to exist in a world where every blockchain is inherently built to communicate with one another. There’s legitimate reason for debate regarding the net benefit of cross-chain networking, even if it has put a spotlight on fledgling chains and allowed innovative concepts to spread. There does exist a possibility that bridging and total interoperability in blockchains can lead to a future where the failure of one protocol or blockchain lacks isolation. This could result in legitimate market shocks across the DeFi space. This article contains links to third-party websites or other content for information purposes only (“Third-Party Sites”).

    "title": "Columbus-5 Is Almost Here — What Does That Mean For Terra and Its Users: Flipside Crypto",
    "detailedContent": "Changes are coming to the Terra blockchain — BIG changes. In fact, according to the Terra Twitter account itself, it’s going to be “Terra’s most significant mainnet upgrade yet.” The mainnet upgrade known as Columbus-5 will be deployed later this week, at roughly 3:30 AM UTC on Sept. 30 (11:30 PM EST on Sept. 29). The upgrade has been some time coming, as it was originally planned for Sept. 9 before being delayed to later the same month. According to a Twitter thread from Terra, this was done “to implement some extra precautionary measures for the rollout.” So, before it arrives later this week, let’s take a closer look at what the upgrade will mean for Terra, the #LUNAtics and other Terra users, and the protocols that call it home. Columbus-5 — What Is It and What Will It Bring? There are three main changes that Columbus-5 brings: an upgrade to Stargate and the integration of IBC protocol, the integration of Ozone and Wormhole, and a new burn policy. Each one will carry major implications for the Terra ecosystem. Burn, Baby, Burn Perhaps the most notable part of the upgrade for many retail investors and speculators is the decision to burn all seigniorage. Previously, seigniorage, or LUNA burned to mint UST, was diverted to a community pool that was used for oracle rewards and eventually became overfunded. After the deployment, this LUNA will instead be burned, which is designed to increase the value of the currency and give more rewards to LUNA stakers. Upgrading to Stargate This is one of the biggest changes brought on by Columbus-5. Upgrading to Stargate will enable integration of the Inter Blockchain Communication protocol, or IBC, which provides support for a large collection of interchain use cases. This will make UST the go-to stablecoin for networks like Cosmos, expanding the use case of Terra to more than 250 unique dapps. Welcome, Ozone + Wormhole Columbus-5 will also see the introduction of Ozone and Wormhole. Ozone, a coverage protocol designed by Terraform Labs, is designed to lock up and secure a significant share of UST, providing insurance for projects built by TFL. Wormhole, meanwhile, is a bridge between Terra and Solana that will enable the movement of UST between the two networks. This should allow further integration and collaboration between Terra and Solana projects. How Will Columbus-5 Affect Users? First, and foremost, users should know to stay away from Terra and its associated protocols and projects during the upgrade later this week. Attempting to complete any transactions could result in funds being lost for good. But what about after the upgrade has been deployed? Well, for one thing, the changes outlined above have made Columbus-5 a hotly anticipated update across the #LUNAtic and wider Terra community. In fact, many are anticipating a rally in the price of $LUNA to follow the arrival of Columbus-5. LUNA stakers will also likely see staking rewards grow thanks to the new burning of seigniorage. The arrival of Columbus-5 also means that a horde of new protocols and going projects will be going live this week. Once the upgrade is officially deployed, more than 50 protocols will soon be live and accessible to users. These protocols will cover everything from existing applications like savings accounts and mirrored assets to new use cases like investment dashboards, NFT creation and sales, derivatives, and more. Check out a full list of protocols and more information on these projects in this Twitter thread from @FynnToTheMoon or this thread from @FastGameCrypto.",

    "title": "An Overleveraged Crypto Market Leads to a 20% Drop: A Data Perspective by IntoTheBlock",
    "detailedContent": "Every other week, IntoTheBlock brings you on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. An Overleveraged Crypto Market Leads to a 20% Drop In the morning of Sept. 7, crypto market sentiment was positive overall: El Salvador officially began to apply their Bitcoin law recognizing Bitcoin as a legal tender. The previous price action candles were bullish at a steady place in what seemed like the farewell to the $50K band price for Bitcoin, but in a matter of hours, all of the crypto market started to sell-off significantly. The crypto market capitalization dropped -20% from $2.37T to $1.97T in barely 12 hours. It quickly after recovered to around $2.0T, where it is at the time of writing, so the plunge accounts so far for a -15% over the last 24 hours. The price fall affected Bitcoin and Ethereum similarly. As of Sept. 8, based on IntoTheBlock’s capital markets insights. While the price fall for Bitcoin was as much as -19% (from $53K to $43K), for Ethereum it accounted for -23% (from $3.9K to $3.0K). The bounce and quick price recovery was 11% for Bitcoin, while 18% for Ethereum. Taking into account these bounces and the last price action data, at the time of writing these price reductions are -14% for Bitcoin and -15% for Ethereum. Even after these drops, Ethereum’s 11.26% price increase in a month-over-month performance is outpacing Bitcoin, which sits around a 5.48% price increase. This data shows that — besides Ethereum being a more volatile asset than Bitcoin — its recent price performance is still better than Bitcoin, even when the market drops considerably. As for market sell-offs, even though they come often in the crypto market, this one did not even turn the month-over-month return negative, and prices are lingering around last week’s levels. Despite some news attributing the price crash to a “buy the rumor, sell the news” strategy due to El Salvador’s law, the data shows that the market was heavily leveraged and some market sell orders unleashed a liquidations cascade on long orders on futures derivatives markets, which exacerbated the price fall considerably. According to Bybit liquidation data, more than $3B has been liquidated in derivatives positions, more than 92% being long positions. Most of those $3B were in Bitcoin ($1.42B), while the other liquidations were notably in Ethereum ($949M) and Ripple ($225M). This is the biggest number of liquidations since the May 19 crash. Using IntoTheBlock data, it can be appreciated how the open interest in perpetual futures derivatives — which is the dollar amount of open positions —has decreased from $16.5B to $11.75B for Bitcoin. These positions usually involve high amounts of leverage. As of Sept. 8, based on IntoTheBlock’s capital markets insights. A reduction in open interest is partially due to liquidations forcing certain positions to close, but also due to traders who decide to close their positions without the need for them to have been liquidated — an action that is expected when the market starts to see high levels of volatility. Open interest data can be put into context by comparing it with the market capitalization of the coin. In this way, a ratio can be obtained that takes into account perpetual futures activity relative to the value of all the coins in circulation. This is the ratio of perpetual swaps open interest to Bitcoin’s market cap, which had been rising, as too many people had bullish leverage positions. In the next chart, it can be seen that when the open interest notional value has been greater than 1.55%, the market has reversed and rapid price action has followed. As of Sept. 8, based on IntoTheBlock’s capital markets insights. Did investors take advantage and buy the dip this time? The exchange flows indicator highlights trends of traders sending money in and out of exchanges. Net flows are positive when more funds are entering than leaving exchanges, and net flows are negative when a greater volume is being withdrawn from exchanges. As it can be seen on Sept. 6, the total balance of Bitcoin that left exchanges was more than the amount entering the exchanges by 8.3K BTC, which is around $428M. This means that many traders and investors took the advantage to buy Bitcoin and send it from centralized exchange to wallet addresses, which supposedly minimizes further selling pressure since the coins need to be located in exchange addresses for them to be able to be sold. As of Sept. 8, based on IntoTheBlock’s capital markets insights. Despite the quick bounce after the sell-off showing conviction by traders, the Sept. 7 price action is not overwhelmingly bullish so far and further price discounts would not be anything surprising. Historically, September has been the month with the worst returns on average for the crypto markets. Overall, this data analysis teaches the lesson that the derivatives market continues to rule the price action for the crypto markets. Furthermore, traders — especially those that use leverage — should consider proceeding with caution when open interest achieves higher and higher amounts and the price continues to grow for several days in a row without some meaningful correction.

    "title": "Quarterly Delivery, US Dollar Strengthening: Weekly Market Review From TokenInsight",
    "detailedContent": "This week, mainstream cryptos were greatly affected by liquidity factors. Before the FOMC meeting in September, concerns about shrinking liquidity caused a large number of investors to \"withdraw\" from the crypto market, triggering huge market volatility. But considering that it coincides with quarterly derivatives delivery, market volatility is still in the normal range. The size of derivatives delivery in this quarter even slightly exceeded the semi-annual delivery size on Jun 25. Take the options market as an example, the size of options delivered on September 24 is estimated to be no less than $4.712B. The Fed\u0027s interest rate resolution on Thursday eased market tensions and market volatility fell significantly after that. However, considering that US regulators will impose stricter regulatory measures on cryptos in the future and the fact that the marginal contraction of liquidity has begun, the future trend of US dollar liquidity will dominate the market trend in the short and medium term. Before and After Quarterly Delivery: Liquidity Changes Triggered a Sharp Market Shock Since Sep 20, affected by the exodus of market liquidity, the crypto market has once again experienced a sharp downward shock. Bitcoin prices were once below $40,000, and market volatility has jumped due to the combined impact of liquidity changes and the approaching delivery of derivatives. However, from the overall data in Sep, since the sharp drop around Sep 7 has reduced the leverage level of the market to a certain extent, the large-scale exodus of liquidity around Sep 20 did not actually have an excessive impact. From the perspective of implied volatility, the market confidence of professional investors is still relatively strong. Judging from the turnover in the derivatives market, the delivery pressure has been released around Sep 20-22, so the turnover of derivatives on the delivery day is actually not high. As of 15:00 (UTC + 8) on Sep 24, the turnover of perpetual contracts is about $74.3B, of which the trading volume in Binance exchange is about $33.5B, and the trading volume of perpetual contracts on exchanges such as Huobi and Bybit are all around $6B. It is worth noting that Huobi\u0027s intra-exchange perpetual contract positions have recovered. Compared with the last quarterly closing, Huobi\u0027s intra-exchange positions have recovered to about $1.4B, up about 27.3% from the end of the previous quarter. However, from the perspective of skewness and futures premium term structure, the market attitude is still generally cautious. The skewness of mainstream cryptos continues to be negative in the near future, while the October futures products premiums are generally less than 4%, on the edge of negative premium, while the market forward futures premium is relatively stable. Liquidity Contraction Expected to Strengthen, Regulatory Pressure Surged This week, institutional activities had relatively little impact on crypto prices, while regulatory pressure on the crypto market rose sharply again after May. In East Asia, the People\u0027s Bank of China issued a \"Notice on Further Preventing and Handling the Risk of Speculation in Virtual Currency Trading\", which mentioned that overseas crypto exchanges providing services to residents in China through the Internet are also illegal financial activities, and staff providing marketing promotion, payment and settlement, technical support and other services will also be investigated for relevant responsibilities according to law. In addition, South Korea will close more than 40 exchanges that do not meet regulatory requirements on Sep 25. Strong regulation in East Asia may push up market risk aversion, but considering that the volume of transactions from the Asian region has dropped significantly since May, regulatory risks have been basically cleared, and the influence of regulation from the Asian region on the crypto market in the future will be relatively limited. In the US, SEC Chairman Gensler said on Tuesday that the SEC has \"strong\" authority to regulate cryptocurrencies, congress can help regulate stable currencies, and the US Treasury Department said it would impose more sanctions on cryptocurrency services that help illegal practices, with crypto platforms such as \"nested exchanges\", \"hybrid exchanges\" and \"peer-to-peer\" receiving priority attention. In addition, US President Biden plans to nominate Omarova, a law professor who has criticized cryptocurrencies and advocated a greater role for the government in the banking industry, to head the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The US House of Representatives has passed the 2021 defence budget bill, which includes provisions related to cryptocurrencies. It is understood that the defence budget bill usually has broad bipartisan support in the US and is regarded as a must-pass bill. However, the provisions related to cryptocurrencies in the bill may soon be incorporated into law. The bill is currently awaiting Senate approval. At the same time, the proposed bill will require the US Securities Regulatory Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to clearly define which institution supervises which aspects of the crypto market. In addition, Congress will establish a working group composed of representatives of the SEC and CFTC within 90 days of the passage of the bill. There is no doubt that the deflection of US regulatory wind may further promote the outflow of liquidity from the crypto market. Although the Fed\u0027s interest rate resolution on September 24 has not yet released the details of Taper and kept interest rates unchanged, the liquidity contraction has actually begun: the Federal Reserve accepted $1.35T in fixed-rate reverse repos, continuing to brush a record high for five consecutive days. The New York Federal Reserve raised the limit for counterparties in the overnight reverse repos to US $160 billion on Sep 24. At the same time, UK interest rate futures prices show that the Bank of England is slightly more than 80% likely to raise interest rates by 15 basis points by February 2022. Under this influence, US Treasury yields have risen sharply. Although the liquidity contraction will not have a significant impact in the short term, the strength of low-risk assets such as the US dollar under the liquidity contraction will change investors\u0027 risk appetite in the medium and long term, and the liquidity outflow pressure in the crypto market may continue.

    "detailedContent": "Every week, TokenInsight brings you a weekly crypto news roundup in collaboration with CoinMarketCap, TokenInsight is a leading Data \u0026 Tech-driven Blockchain Financial Institution. Before Christmas, we witness a new history again. On EST 8:42:11, Dec. 16, 2020, Bitcoin went over the cliff of $20,000, finally. One small tick for the price, one giant leap for the crypto market. In this year, we have witnessed so many miracles from crypto markets: Bitcoin jumped up from $5,000 to higher than $20,000, DeFi’s boom started changing the financial ecosystem fundamentally, the crypto options market flourished and matured gradually, and the crypto itself stepped into the hall from the bleak corner and became the new star welcomed by institutions and capital markets. Moreover, a series of new technologies and concepts will change finance, economics and the whole world from bottom to the top. The new year is coming, praying for the future? We are in the future. Merry Christmas and Hallelujah. Enjoy your vacation and our review. Bitcoin Stands Above the New Peak Before that moment, Bitcoin’s price and the trading volume kept comparatively flat, around $19,000 and $3 billion per day respectively until Dec. 16. However, even though Bitcoin had amassed enough power stealthily, investors thought that 2020 will end with a flat rhythm. From Dec. 16, the price of Bitcoin rose quickly and broke through $20,000 on 8:42 EST, Dec. 16 2020. The market seethes. Bitcoin’s daily trading volume jumps to $10 billion, which is the largest in the last 30 days. The price also does not stop its step. As of 9pm on Dec. 17, Bitcoin’s price once hit $23,652 and has kept above the $20,000 line for more than 40 hours. BTC price and historical trading volume in the last 30 days, chart from 9pm EST, Dec. 17. Source: tokeninsight.com Who Is the First? As Bitcoin’s price soared up to all-time high, TokenInsight analyzed the six minutes of trading data around that breaking point from five major exchanges — Binance, Bitfinex, Coinbase, Huobi and OKEx — and we found something interesting. Breaking time when Bitcoin hit $20,000, Dec. 16. Source: tokeninsight.com What Happened During the All-Time High Moment? The following figure shows the comparison of the number of transactions on various exchanges within six minutes before and after Bitcoin broke $20,000. Transactions info when Bitcoin hit $20,000, Dec. 16. Source: tokeninsight.com Transactions are concentrated on small size orders less than one Bitcoin. Among the five exchanges, 132,885 small transactions (orders less than one Bitcoin) happened in total during those six minutes, accounting for nearly 98% of all transactions. Huobi and Binance contributed the most, accounting for 65,096 and 38,963 respectively. Huobi has 64,022 small transactions. OKEx has the highest proportion of small transactions, reaching 98.54% of its total. OKEx, Huobi and Binance account for a significantly higher percentage of small transactions than Bitfinex and Coinbase. Meanwhile, large transactions occurred quite often on Bitfinex, reaching 164 in total, while OKEx only has six trades, —but the largest order appears in OKEx is a 14.93 Bitcoin buying order, dealing with $19,900. Bid Orders 3X Surpass the Ask Orders in Large Transactions Bitcoin buying demand far exceeds selling demand. Among the executed orders, the quantity of the bid orders is 1.41 times of the ask orders. The transaction volume of the bid orders is 1.82 times higher than the volume of the ask orders. At the same time, the larger the volume, the stronger the demand for bid orders. In large transactions greater than five Bitcoin, the number and the transaction volume of bid orders are as high as 275 and 2,781 Bitcoin, respectively. The number and the transaction volume of ask orders are 89 and 893 Bitcoin. Bitcoin orders amounts and volume comparison, Dec. 16. Source: tokeninsight.com Ethereum Keeps Tepid Nevertheless, is the price rise this time just a flash in the pan like before? From the perspective of Ethereum, reactions from the crypto market are seemingly not so hot. After Ethereum 2.0 launched officially, the price of ETH stabilized between $500 and $600, and it just went up by about 10% after 40 hours from Bitcoin breaking through $20,000, which is far lower than Bitcoin, and the highest daily trading volume is just $3.33 billion, not the highest level of this month. BTC price and historical trading volume in the last 30 days, chart from 9pm EST, Dec. 17. Source: tokeninsight.com ETH’s weekly performance is not shining like BTC either, and the trading volume of ETH’s spot and perpetual are just half of BTC’s volume approximately. Generally speaking, the fluctuation of ETH is more than BTC, but it is lower than BTC this week. When we think about the high correlation between them, this condition seems abnormal. What’s the future trend of the crypto market? Maybe the options markets’ performance can reveal some signs. BTC and ETH trading volume info of this week, chart from 9pm EST, Dec. 17. Source: tokeninsight.com Information From Futures, Options From Investors Futures and options are one kind of derivatives which imply future information, including investors’ thoughts for the futures markets, for both futures and options are executed someday after the buying day. Investors often buy futures and call options when they feel optimistic, and they will sell futures and buy put options when they have a cautious attitude to the market. The market is the aggregation of investors. Therefore, futures and options’ trading volumes are valid indicators for knowing the trend of the crypto market. Rising trading volume in the derivative market means investors have interests in the future, but shrinking trading volume means a more cautious view. BTC futures and perpetual options historical trading volume in the last 30 days, chart from 9pm EST, Dec. 17. Source: tokeninsight.com and skew.com When we have a look at the trading volume in last week, it is easy to find that investors’ confidence for the BTC is strengthened after Bitcoin hit $20,000: before that moment, the trading volume was lower than $25 billion per day on average, but after that, trading volume soared up to $80.4 billion. But we couldn\u0027t distinguish the future according to trading volume only. The open interest is another indicator often reflecting market participation. Compared with recent weeks, the open interest of Bitcoin futures reached a new peak after Bitcoin broke all-time high records, which implies the market\u0027s flourishing. BTC futures and perpetual options historical open interest in the last 30 days, chart from 9pm EST, Dec. 17. Source: tokeninsight.com and skew.com Moreover, let’s think about two vital indicators: funding rates and implied volatility. We have explained the meanings of them in the last market blog (Phoney Silence? Weekly Market Review by TokenInsight), so we will unscramble these indicators directly. Funding rates of BTC in the last 90 days, chart from 9pm EST, Dec. 17. Source: tokeninsight.com Compared with last week, the funding rate turns positive with a high rise, especially for the coin-margined contract. This indicates more investors are keeping a positive view for the future of the market, at least for the future of Bitcoin. Recent implied volatility surface of BTC options, chart from 7am EST, Dec. 17, Source: gvol.io Recent volatility surfaces reveal that investors tend to buy options. Combining volatility surfaces with funding rates, it is obvious that investors tend to buy call options, which can also prove investors’ confidence for the market. However, for the long term, the volatility surface reveals that investors still hold an optimistic but cautious attitude in general. Term structure of BTC options, chart from 7am EST, Dec. 17, Source: gvol.io The last but most vital information is from implied volatility’s term structure. These curves illustrate that investors show more confidence for short-term than long-term. In general, the next year’s implied volatility is upraised, which means that we will face a more fluctuant market in the future. Highlights Picked by TokenInsight Coinbase Submitted Files to SEC to go Public On Thursday (Dec. 17, 2020), U.S. major cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase confidentially filed preliminary documents, Form S-1, with SEC, getting ready for its initial public offering.

    "detailedContent": "What we will be covering today: This week, macroeconomic factors have had a significant impact on the crypto market. Due to relatively stable market expectations, the volatility of mainstream cryptos decreased significantly this week, and the speculative activity of derivatives decreased, but the transaction activity in the spot market increased. The impact of macroeconomic factors on the crypto market is concentrated in prices and does not affect volatility. The monthly retail sales rate in July was lower than expected, resulting in a short correction in the prices of mainstream cryptos. However, the good performance of jobless claims data at the beginning of last week and good information in the crypto industry stimulated investors\u0027 expectations to rise and asset prices to return to high levels. Regulatory and security incidents have a limited impact on the performance of mainstream cryptos this week. Subscribe Join us in showcasing the cryptocurrency revolution, one newsletter at a time. Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox, along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right, millions love us!) — what are you waiting for? Volatility Declined, While Market Expectations Remained After the volatility of cryptos stagnated last week, the volatility of the crypto market declined significantly this week. As of this Friday, the historical volatility of Bitcoin has dropped to below 60, and the historical volatility of Ethereum has dropped to below 80. Judging from the annual data, the current volatility of mainstream cryptos is basically the same as that in the first half of April, which means that the market volatility may be close to the bottom, and caution should be exercised in shorting volatility strategies. From the perspective of skewness, mainstream cryptos\u0027 neutral sentiment continues. However, it is worth noting that there has been a certain decline in forward skewness. Investors seem to be lowering forward expectations, and the rise in the probability of early marginal contraction of market liquidity is the main reason. The market expectations of the options sellers have remained at a relatively high level in the near future, and there has been no major change. From the perspective of the futures market, market expectations are also relatively stable: mainstream crypto futures products in major futures exchanges (Deribit, OKEX, FTX) have maintained a significant positive premium of about 7% to 9%, and even CME, an exchange dominated by traditional market investors with conservative investment styles, has also seen a positive premium of more than 3%. Macro Factors Still Dominate the Rhythm of Market This week, regulators were more active than last week, taking frequent actions on transaction compliance, but did not have a significant impact on the crypto market. Spain\u0027s National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and the People\u0027s Bank of China have punished some exchanges for unlicensed operations, trading, publicity, and other acts. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) issued a notice warning investors not to trade cryptos on platforms that do not hold an Australian Financial Services (AFS) license and pointed out that investing in crypto derivatives trading is too risky. Some Fed officials also expressed concern about the risks of trading cryptos at this week\u0027s Fed meeting. Iran\u0027s National Tax Administration (INTA) has put forward proposals on a new legal system for crypto trading, aiming to increase fiscal revenue through exchange compliance and taxation. Regulatory action against Binance continues: Binance is banned from operating in the Netherlands for its violation of various Dutch laws, according to a statement issued by the Dutch central bank on August 18. The Dutch central bank is likely to take action against Binance, but details are not yet clear. In addition, traders seeking compensation from Binance for service disruptions during market turmoil earlier this year have received financial support to prepare for one of the largest legal battles to date against the exchange. They have filed claims totaling more than $20M dollars against the exchange and hope to unite hundreds of traders. Binance is aggressively hiring a compliance team to deal with the situation. Chief executive Zhao Changpeng said the priority was to \"recruit people with compliance and regulatory experience\". The company is also seeking regular meetings with US officials. The US Treasury is preparing guidance to help define \"crypto brokers\", which could be published as early as next week. Some practitioners in the crypto industry have welcomed the regulation. They believe that stricter regulation of cryptos may stimulate the demand for cryptos. At present, due to the fear of fraud, the lack of supervision fees has prevented some investors from using cryptos, because not all investors are willing to bear the risk of fraud, which is not protected by law. The regulatory clampdown may lead to wider adoption of cryptos, because it will strengthen people\u0027s investment. This will affect the price of cryptos in a \"positive way\". Institutions are increasingly interested in investing in cryptos and crypto-related industries. Last weekend data showed that net short positions in bitcoin futures reached their lowest level since mid-May. Traders were forced to exit short positions in bitcoin and Ethereum and began to build long positions. The clear signs of improved demand in the futures market indicate that institutional demand for cryptos is rising. This week, Wells Fargo registered a private Bitcoin fund. Tech giants are beginning to lay out or strengthen their presence in the field of cryptos: Intel bought more than 3,000 shares of Coinbase for its first investment in the field of cryptos, while Facebook\u0027s crypto division has set its sights on third-party stable currency transactions. Crypto-related companies are widely favored: Bitpanda, the European crypto trading platform, raised $263M in a new round of financing and reached a valuation of $4.1B. 5 months ago, the company was worth only $1.2B. Bitcoin miner Iris Energy is expected to list on Nasdaq in the fourth quarter of 2021. Jefferies and Barclays have become joint book runners of London-listed miner Argo Blockchain. Coinbase announced this week that it will reinvest 10% of its profits in cryptos and is already preparing to buy $500M cryptos. In addition, Coinbase has teamed up with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group to create a crypto exchange in Japan that allows customers to use accounts with Mitsubishi Bank to buy and sell cryptos. On the macro-economic front, due to the spread of the epidemic again, the economic stimulus plan and liquidity supply have continued, which is beneficial to maintaining high prices of cryptos. Affected by the epidemic, the New Zealand Reserve Bank (RBNZ) decided to cancel the interest rate hike plan this week and keep the interest rate low. As a hawkish central bank, the RBNZ\u0027s attitude shows that in order to fight the epidemic, it will not tighten liquidity for the time being. Considering that the attitude of major western countries is generally more moderate than that of the RBNZ, the liquidity tightening is expected to ease somewhat. The number of first-time US jobless claims last week was 348K, the smallest increase since the week of March 14, 2020, and the fourth consecutive week of decline, indicating that employment growth was strong last month. The minutes of this week\u0027s Federal Reserve meeting pointed out that most people believe that a proportional reduction in the purchase of residential mortgage-backed securities and treasury bonds is beneficial. The decision to reduce debt has nothing to do with the timing of interest rate hikes, and the Federal Reserve may reach the threshold for reducing the scale of debt purchases this year. Most participants pointed out that the spread of the Delta virus could temporarily delay a full economic restart. Recent inflation data have been affected by supply bottlenecks and labor shortages and are likely to be temporary. Rosengren, chairman of the Boston Federal Reserve, said he would support a reduction in bond purchases starting next month, as large-scale bond purchases are not suitable for the US. On the same day, Brad, chairman of the St Louis Fed, said he would prefer to reduce the scale of bond purchases in the first quarter of 2022. The Fed is expected to allow the balance sheet to be reduced after the reduction is completed, allowing market pricing to control long-term credit markets. The fourth quarter of 2022 is a reasonable time to raise interest rates. Although the Fed Taper (tightening liquidity) is expected to advance, the first phase of measures to reduce debt-based, only to tighten marginal liquidity, the near-term impact on asset prices is small. However, as the economy recovers, future scale reductions and even interest rate hikes will have a significant impact on crypto prices. Next week, PMI data from major developed countries, consumer confidence index, and the new issue of US jobless claims will be released one by one, further judgment on macroeconomic trends will become the core factor affecting the expectations of crypto investors, and next week\u0027s monthly derivatives delivery will also push up market volatility together with macro factors.

    "detailedContent": "This week, we have witnessed the highest volatility of the crypto asset market this year. As of 11:00 on May 21, the historical volatility of Bitcoin perpetual contracts in the crypto asset market has risen to 181.3, and that of Ethereum has reached an \"horrific\" 252.86, which have separated obviously from the historical volatility of spot index prices, rare in the history of crypto assets. Ethereum spot index price and perpetual contract historical volatility, source: gvol.io The market has stabilized from the temporary panic, as of 14:00 on May 21, the price of Bitcoin dropped to $29,000 and was stable near $40,000, and Ethereum has also successfully maintained at $2,500, however, a large number of contract liquidations, selling pressure caused by panic selling, DeFi serial liquidation and other information still make investors feel lingering. Even the \"industry giant V\" Justin Sun has even been liquidated away from his 600,000 ETH position; it can be said that May 19 is the \"darkest time\" in this bull market in the crypto asset market.

Has the bull market ended? What factors caused the sudden panic and plunge in the market? We found some clues through a variety of data indicators.

Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox, along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right, millions love us!) — what are you waiting for? Is There Widespread Panic in the Market? Indeed, there was a panic in the market, but this time it did not trigger a \"widespread panic.\" Speculators placed a great amount of bets on perpetual, and the market performance often reflects the mood of speculators. In terms of trading volume, the market trading volume is basically the same as the large-scale fluctuations at the end of February: taking Bitcoin as an example, the market perpetual volume on February 23 and 24 reached more than $370 billion, and this time the perpetual trading volume was around $320 billion, not the highest this year. The possible reason is that the market has established expectations of a decline in a long-term sideways market. Therefore, the scale of panic selling is relatively limited in this decline. The greater possibility for the growing trading volume is perpetual liquidation. Of course, the sell-off is not non-existent: as of 15:00 on May 21, Bitcoin perpetual holdings fell to $15.6 billion, a 29.54% drop compared to last week, slightly higher than the weekly price fluctuations of around 21%. It shows that some investors have chosen to liquidate their positions in a highly volatile market, but overall, the decline in market positions has not been significant, and has not reached the standard of \"significant impact\". Changes in the trading volume of Bitcoin perpetual in the past 90 days, as of 15:00 on May 21, source: tokeninsight.com On the other hand, the amount of liquidation confirms the view of \"limited panic\". Before the large-scale liquidation on May 19, the scale of liquidation caused by the sharp drop on April 17 was actually relatively larger: Bitcoin fell from around $62,000 to $55,000. The long and short sides combined liquidation exceeds $10 billion. At this time, expectations for a decline have been established; there is consensus that there will be a callback in the market in mid-year. Due to the early release of pressure, the liquidation volume on May 19 was less than $8.6 billion, which largely avoided the liquidity crisis and even further chain reactions caused by excessive market liquidation. Changes in the daily settlement amount of perpetual in the whole market in the past 90 days, source: bybt.com In the spot market, there was the second peak on May 19th since the beginning of January: the day after the price fell, the transaction volume of Bitcoin reached $45.64 billion, and the spot transaction volume of all-market tokens reached $232.3 billion. There seems to be a massive sale, but it is not. While a large number of individual investors choose to sell digital assets, some European and American investment institutions and individual investors who intend to \"buy the dip\". The large number of buying and selling operations that day pushed up the trading volume, and of course it also dysfunctioned exchanges: Binance and Coinbase both experienced varying degrees of trading congestion and downtime due to excessive data processing and liquidation. However, with the combined efforts of liquidity providers, market makers, quantitative hedge funds, exchanges, and even individual investors, the liquidity of the digital asset market has not been significantly affected. Changes in the trading volume of the digital asset spot market in the past 90 days, source: tokeninsight.com From the perspective of capital inflow/outflow, after the 19th, the capital in mainstream digital asset markets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum is actually in a state of inflow. Within 24 hours, the inflow of funds in the Bitcoin market reached $250 million, and Ethereum reached $330 million. On the whole, the outflow of Bitcoin funds in the past month, the inflows of the high-yield digital asset market such as Ethereum has not changed, and the market value of Bitcoin still remains below 45%. Cash net inflows/net outflows of Bitcoin and Ethereum in the past 30 days, source: tokeninsight.com What Is FOMO? The inflow and outflow of funds in different exchanges within 24 hours also revealed the regional nature of panic and selling. On Binance, Huobi, OKEx and other exchanges, the Bitcoin market is in a state of outflow or close to outflow; the sell-off is dominated by small amounts. A large number of users of the three exchanges are from East Asia, and Huobi and OKEx exchanges account for the majority. Changes in Bitcoin market capital flow on Binance, Huobi, and OKEx exchanges in the past 24 hours, source: tokeninsight.com On the contrary, Coinbase, FTX, and Bitstamp exchanges where European and American investors are concentrated, all investors are buying Bitcoin, and the net inflow of funds is very obvious. On the Ethereum market, most mainstream exchanges have shown a significant inflow of funds except Binance. It is the same as the past 30 days. The above information shows that the selling pressure in the Bitcoin market is likely to come from East Asia, and the impact on Ethereum is small. There has been an abnormal movement in the Bitcoin market. What happened in East Asia? Changes in Bitcoin market capital flow on Coinbase, FTX, and Bitstamp in the past 24 hours, source: tokeninsight.com The outflow of funds in the Bitcoin market of East Asia exchanges in the past 30 days/The inflow of funds in the Bitcoin market of exchanges in Europe and the United States in the past 30 days, source: tokeninsight.com What Happened Around May 19th? It is easy to find that the crowds of panic selling mainly come from East Asia. Let us sort out the background of the incident: Since the bull market began, one of the largest stock markets in Asia has seen a large amount of net outflows. Among them, the large outflow of funds from public funds has continued, with an average daily outflow of $2.44 billion. The large number of fund redemptions from the beginning of the year may be an important influencing factor. Where did the money go? In the past month, Bitcoin on the Binance exchange has received approximately $83 billion, while Huobi and OKEx have received nearly $30 billion. It is just Bitcoin. If you calculate the derivatives market, the amount of funds inflows in the entire digital asset market is surprisingly amazing, of which a large amount of funds inflows come from East Asia. In contrast, since the beginning of this year, the amount of funds raised within the stock market has plummeted: From the closure of mining in Inner Mongolia, to the bank\u0027s warning that digital asset transactions will be restricted and the industry association issuing a document requiring restrictions on digital asset transactions, the darkest moment on May 19 may have been brewing for a long time. As for why the digital asset market is suddenly \"regulated\", the changes in the traditional market may give us some clues. After Darkness: The Market Is Still in a High-Risk Phase It is true that on May 19, the digital asset market as a whole was not severely hit. However, as the Fed considers the impact of factors such as stopping QE, raising rates, and high inflation, the funds flowing into the digital asset market may gradually flow out in the future, and even pierce the bubble and end the bull market under the influence of certain major events. But it is still too early to announce the end of the bull market . However, the current volatility gap continues to be positive and has expanded, indicating that high volatility and downward trends are still in the process; considering the predictive effect of the volatility gap on market performance, the digital asset market has a high risk situation in the coming days. Market confidence needs time to recover; and from the expectations of professional investors, the time required for the market to return to the normal level during the bull market (2 trillion US dollars in market cap) may take longer than expected. Risk expectations and control will become the core themes of investors in recent days and even weeks.

    "title": "How Regulations May Affect the Mining Industry: A Data Perspective by IntoTheBlock",
    "detailedContent": "Every week, IntoTheBlock brings you on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. How Regulations May Affect the Mining Industry During this past week BTC prices have recorded a significant positive rise in price, despite the unclear regulatory outcomes in the U.S. Congress. In this article we will explore the potential path ahead for Bitcoin analyzing on-chain data. Moreover, we will assess the coming one trillion U.S. infrastructure deal, its implications on crypto and the direct effects it could have over the U.S. mining industry. This past week the crypto market has been experiencing a rise in price, BTC surpassed the $43K noted resistance. Generally led by a continued bull run from the past couple weeks, BTC price currently sits around $46K and IntoTheBlock’s In and Out of the Money Around Price (IOMAP) indicator marks the $49K point as the next spot where high volume of transactions were registered on-chain. As of Aug. 11, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin Financial metrics The IOMAP reveals that 178.31k addresses had previously bought approximately 433.53k Bitcoin at a price around $43,000. Due to the large buying activity around this area, there is expected to be strong support from new buyers and current holders. On the other hand, there is strong resistance around $50,000. The high amount of volume that was previously bought there (289.49k BTC) is expected to create selling pressure as many holders tend to look to sell positions at a break-even level. On Tuesday, the U.S. Senate gave an uncommon bipartisan approval to the $1Trillion infrastructure bill, intended to rebuild the country’s roads, bridges, airports and waterways, one of President Biden’s top priorities in agenda. The bill with great approval of The Senate, having a voting count of 69 to 30, now moves onto the House of Representatives where they will be discussing its implications in order to take a final vote on it. Senator Portman, originally introduced the provision in the infrastructure bill. This bill gives U.S. crypto entities new regulations. The bill requires that all operating U.S. crypto broker entities report transaction data to the IRS. The problem is that the specific definition for crypto “brokers” was not included in the provision. Without this clear definition, anyone operating a mining operation, staking on a proof of stake protocol or even developers creating cryptocurrencies may fit under these new regulations. Senator Portman addressed these concerns, stating that language in the bill should not be interpreted this broadly and that work should be done to clarify the exemption of miners and stakers. A group of senators in between them Cynthia Lummis introduced a new amendment last Wednesday night, in which clear clarification was given that only trading desks or entities with a similar function will be in the obligation to follow this reporting regulations. Even though this amendment was introduced last Wednesday the Senate voted in favor of passing the deal without any amendments being done; meaning no changes will be introduced to the provision and now is up to the House of Representatives to decide whether or not to continue with the deal. At IntoTheBlock we have been monitoring some indicators regarding this new regulation\u0027s effects. Particularly, this is likely to have a significant impact on the mining industry, which has been growing within the U.S. following China’s crackdown. The Hash Rate is the total speed at which mining machines are operating to solve the mathematical puzzle that validates transactions in a block. This indicator shown below is the estimated aggregate computational power (measured in Terahash per second) provided by miners to operate a given network. As of Aug. 10, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s mining indicators Since its May high of 188.04m TH/s the mining industry was seen heavily affected by the China mining ban recording a low of 62.03m TH/s on June 27. Many mining activity immigrated to the U.S, specifically to the state of Texas. This makes the current legislation discussion of prime importance to the mining sector, as miners would fit under the new “brokers” definition and would have to be regulated as such. The hash rate indicator has recorded a slow but steady recovery, and continues to show positive signs regardless of the current discussion surring mining in the U.S. congress. On the other hand, Miner Reserves point to signs of concern.The miner reserves indicator shows the aggregate balances of addresses belonging to mining pools. Typically having correlation with the hash rate indicator during the May highs and the China ban. The indicator showed a clear divergence last week when the largest yearly drop in miner reserves took place. As of Aug. 10, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s mining indicators Recording a high reserve of 2.12 million BTC on May 20th, after being impacted by the massive sell off the miners reserves now hold 1.97 million BTC, representing a decrease of -7.08%. This suggests that miners could be anticipating headwinds in the coming months as crypto legislation in the infrastructure bill is finalized. Therefore, the decrease in miner reserves could be related to American miners selling, taking precautions against potentially stringent regulation. The hash rate distribution indicator shows the concentration of hash rate by mining pools. During the China ban, pools created from Chinese entities were seen heavily affected, impacting their presence in the global hash rate distribution. As of Aug. 10, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s mining indicators During the beginning of May before the China ban implementations, the huobi.pool had a 5.03% of the total hash rate distribution and was mining about 10 blocks per day. Currently after most miners were thrown away from China the pool has a 2.63% of the total hash rate distribution, mining about 5 blocks per day. In the same way Chinese pools have decreased their presence in the total hash rate distribution, a now-significant share of unknown miners pools keep growing. Having many miners being relocated in Texas makes again the future of the industry unstable, which could lead to similar outcomes in the U.S. if regulatory clarity is not provided properly. While it is clear that implementing the infrastructure deal without any new amendments to clarify the cryptocurrency regulations could be a setback, it is important to acknowledge how far the industry has come in just a little over 12 years. During this year the cryptocurrency market cap managed to reach two trillion dollars during the month of April. New legislation is being brought up in Washington in order to clarify and bring clarity into the complex nascent industry.

    "title": "Key Metrics Pointing to Where Crypto May Be Heading Next: A Data Perspective by IntoTheBlock",
    "detailedContent": "Every week, IntoTheBlock brings you on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. Key Metrics Pointing to Where Crypto May Be Heading Next Crypto markets have traded within a narrow range the past few weeks, following the precipitous crash in mid-May. As market participants struggle to take the lead in either direction, news and blockchain indicators may provide valuable insights into what is likely to come next for the crypto space. In terms of news, probably the most relevant recent occurrence is the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) clarification that it will not be banning crypto trading. It had been rumored for multiple months that the RBI would be making it difficult for both institutions and individuals to access crypto and they have cleared up that will not be the case. Following the recent crackdown in China, this comes as a relief for the crypto market. In other news, Google has reversed its stance on advertising from crypto exchanges and wallets. Although crypto entities looking to advertise on Google will still need to be registered with the financial regulators FinCEN, this is a step forward from banning all crypto-related ads in June 2018. Both of these news signal positive developments for crypto. Similarly, on-chain data points to bullish activity following the crash. By looking at the variations in profitability, we are able to identify that buying activity is taking place. The Historical In/Out of the Money (HIOM) does just this, breaking down the number of addresses profiting over time. As of June 2, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin financial metrics Comparing Bitcoin versus ten days ago when it traded slightly higher, we observe two interesting patterns. First, the number of addresses in the money (making profits) is 900k greater, even though the price is currently lower. This points to a large number of holders taking the crash to $30,000 as an opportunity to buy and lower their average costs, thus making them profitable as prices rebounded. Second, the number of addresses out of the money decreased by nearly one million. Though some of these averaged down their entry price, it is also likely that many panic sold, realizing their losses and no longer being considered by the HIOM. This marks the transition in Bitcoin holding from short-term speculators into longer-term investors. The pattern is apparent when looking at the decrease in addresses holding for less than a month, classified as traders by IntoTheBlock. As of June 2, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin ownership metrics The decrease in short-term trading comes as investors become uncertain about where Bitcoin may be heading next in the near-term. Using data on addresses’ profitability we can also determine points of support and resistance for Bitcoin’s trajectory. Addresses’ profitability directly impacts buy and sell orders set by investors. Using on-chain data, IntoTheBlock’s In/Out of the Money Around Price (IOMAP) groups clusters of addresses depending on whether they are profitable (in the money) or losing money (out of the money), at least on paper. The largest clusters of addresses represent at which price the most volume of Bitcoin had previously been bought, and directly influences near-term support and resistance levels. As of June 2, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin financial metrics The IOMAP reveals that 1 million addresses had previously bought approximately 570K Bitcoin at a price around $37,000. Due to the large buying activity around this area, there is expected to be strong support from new buyers and current holders. Were this level to fail, then a drop to $34,000 is likely. On the other hand, there is strong resistance just below $40,000. The high amount of volume that was previously bought there (320K BTC) is expected to create selling pressure as many holders tend to look to sell positions at a break-even level. Moreover, if buyers are able to get Bitcoin beyond this range, a move to $43,000 seems probable as there appears to be little resistance in between. Due to the high concentration of volume currently near price, it is likely that price may continue range-bound, unless there is a major catalyst in either direction. Finally, it is probable that a breakout in either direction for Bitcoin will lead the rest of the crypto markets along. As of June 2, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Ethereum financial metrics This is the case as correlations to Bitcoin have been increasing across the board. In Ether’s case, the correlation with Bitcoin is back to 0.9, pointing to a strong positive relationship between the two, after being negatively correlated for a short period of time. Overall, crypto is at a critical point where people debate whether or not the bull market is over. With positive news and buying activity picking up momentum, it is possible that the worst may be behind us. However, it is too early to discount a move lower if Bitcoin prices drop below $36,000, which would drag the rest of the market along with it.

    "detailedContent": "Oracles play a uniquely important role in the crypto world, particularly in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space — in simplest terms, an oracle is the messenger that brings real-world data to smart contracts. CoinMarketCap, the world’s leading source for digital asset market data in the rapidly growing crypto space, has partnered with DIA to provide CMC data as an oracle. DIA is an ecosystem for open-source financial data, aiming to provide a reliable bridge between off-chain data and smart contracts. ‍Oracles provide fuel that gives smart contracts the data that they need to execute: the fuel of information. Through DIA, CMC’s digital asset market data — also accessible via an API — will now be available through the DIA platform as an oracle, providing yet another gateway to bring CMC data feeds directly to smart contracts. As the DeFi space experienced wild growth through the “DeFi summer wave,” the market’s need for accurate and timely data has only grown. Beyond APIs, oracles are needed more than ever to provide smart contracts with the relevant price data. CoinMarketCap’s oracle will be able to provide data for DeFi applications ranging from lending protocols to management dashboards, all of which will benefit from access to CMC’s accurate data. DIA will initially include CoinMarketCap’s top 50 crypto assets, as well as the top 25 DeFi assets. DIA has the option for its users to customize the setup of the oracle by increasing the data frequency, as well as change the breadth and depth of asset data as needed. The CoinMarketCap data oracle can be easily accessed by visiting the DIA documentation here, and following the implementation guide.",

    "title": "Bitcoin\u0027s Price Recovers as Exchange Outflows Spike: A Data Perspective by IntoTheBlock",
    "detailedContent": "Every week, IntoTheBlock brings you on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. Bitcoin\u0027s Price Recovers as Exchange Outflows Spike During these past weeks the crypto market has experienced market changing events. Several tech companies started looking deeply into the blockchain arena, and Google loosening measures for crypto platforms to advertise on their search engine. Between these and the anticipation of Ethereum’s hard fork upgrade, prices of several tokens rose and retested levels not seen since May. In this article we are going to explore several indicators that reflect and may have been linked to the recent momentum in crypto markets, specifically in Bitcoin. As of Aug. 3, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s capital markets insights The price performance indicator clearly shows the market awakening from what many were calling a bear market. There are several other indicators that clearly show patterns that reflect this change in sentiment, such as flows of crypto in and out of exchanges. The exchange analytics on IntoTheBlock provide an overview of on-chain transfers to and from centralized exchanges. This allows users to see how many tokens are being transferred to and from the exchanges selected. This also provides insights into the market sentiment by providing an idea of how traders are allocating their holdings. The Net Flows indicator highlights the total sum of traders sending money in and out of exchanges. The indicator shows the sum of tokens received minus tokens leaving exchanges. On the indicator negative values will represent the excess of outflows relative to inflows, while positive values represent the greater amounts of inflows into exchanges. As of Aug. 3, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin exchange metrics This indicator gives insights into the market positioning. People withdrawing tokens from exchanges are probably looking to hold their tokens into the future, and looking for higher safety or yield on top of their crypto-assets. For instance, users may prefer to store their holdings in cold wallet storage, while others prefer to lend out their holdings through different centralized or decentralized lending platforms to earn interest. Whereas people sending tokens to exchanges are probably looking into trading the tokens and mostly taking profits, in which we usually see negative price fluctuations. During the recent price fluctuations on July 28th 2021 the indicator recorded a low point in which 32.98K BTC left the exchanges addresses. Tokens leaving exchanges pass onto an illiquid trading state, the higher this illiquid state the more demand there will be for the liquid trading tokens. Liquid trending tokens are categorized as the ones sitting on exchanges. The more people are withdrawing their tokens from exchanges the less available liquid tokens there are to buy. The outflow volume indicator shows the amount of tokens leaving exchanges, in this case BTC. This is helpful to track big token withdrawals and try to anticipate market volatility. As of Aug. 3, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin exchange metrics During this recent price breakthrough the indicator showed a clear correlation between price and the outflow volume. Using IntoTheBlock’s data for the month of July we obtain a 30-day correlation of 0.33 between Bitcoin’s outflow volume and its price, suggesting a moderately high positive relationship between the two. While keeping track of the exchange analytics area is important, the on-chain transaction activity is equally as significant. The transaction volume indicator allows us to see spikes of on-chain activity which usually tend to come hand in hand with price fluctuations. As of Aug. 3, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin network metrics During the recent break-out the indicator showed a clear relation of the on-chain recorded transactions and the price fluctuation. This is important to keep into account since high transaction volume activity together with an increase in price are typically signs that represent strength and health in the market. During the last price fluctuations the indicator recorded a significant spike on the transaction volume activity. Clear evidence is shown of the relation and connection of different sectors of the industry to price fluctuations. It can be seen how specific indicators showed signs of confidence during the market momentum experienced recently. Keeping track of the indicators over time helps spot reversals and break-outs.

    "detailedContent": "Every week, TokenInsight brings you a weekly crypto news roundup in collaboration with CoinMarketCap, TokenInsight is a leading Data \u0026 Tech-driven Blockchain Financial Institution. Before Christmas, we witness a new history again. On EST 8:42:11, Dec. 16, 2020, Bitcoin went over the cliff of $20,000, finally. One small tick for the price, one giant leap for the crypto market. In this year, we have witnessed so many miracles from crypto markets: Bitcoin jumped up from $5,000 to higher than $20,000, DeFi’s boom started changing the financial ecosystem fundamentally, the crypto options market flourished and matured gradually, and the crypto itself stepped into the hall from the bleak corner and became the new star welcomed by institutions and capital markets. Moreover, a series of new technologies and concepts will change finance, economics and the whole world from bottom to the top. The new year is coming, praying for the future? We are in the future. Merry Christmas and Hallelujah. Enjoy your vacation and our review. Bitcoin Stands Above the New Peak Before that moment, Bitcoin’s price and the trading volume kept comparatively flat, around $19,000 and $3 billion per day respectively until Dec. 16. However, even though Bitcoin had amassed enough power stealthily, investors thought that 2020 will end with a flat rhythm. From Dec. 16, the price of Bitcoin rose quickly and broke through $20,000 on 8:42 EST, Dec. 16 2020. The market seethes. Bitcoin’s daily trading volume jumps to $10 billion, which is the largest in the last 30 days. The price also does not stop its step. As of 9pm on Dec. 17, Bitcoin’s price once hit $23,652 and has kept above the $20,000 line for more than 40 hours. BTC price and historical trading volume in the last 30 days, chart from 9pm EST, Dec. 17. Source: tokeninsight.com Who Is the First? As Bitcoin’s price soared up to all-time high, TokenInsight analyzed the six minutes of trading data around that breaking point from five major exchanges — Binance, Bitfinex, Coinbase, Huobi and OKEx — and we found something interesting. Breaking time when Bitcoin hit $20,000, Dec. 16. Source: tokeninsight.com What Happened During the All-Time High Moment? The following figure shows the comparison of the number of transactions on various exchanges within six minutes before and after Bitcoin broke $20,000. Transactions info when Bitcoin hit $20,000, Dec. 16. Source: tokeninsight.com Transactions are concentrated on small size orders less than one Bitcoin. Among the five exchanges, 132,885 small transactions (orders less than one Bitcoin) happened in total during those six minutes, accounting for nearly 98% of all transactions. Huobi and Binance contributed the most, accounting for 65,096 and 38,963 respectively. Huobi has 64,022 small transactions. OKEx has the highest proportion of small transactions, reaching 98.54% of its total. OKEx, Huobi and Binance account for a significantly higher percentage of small transactions than Bitfinex and Coinbase. Meanwhile, large transactions occurred quite often on Bitfinex, reaching 164 in total, while OKEx only has six trades, —but the largest order appears in OKEx is a 14.93 Bitcoin buying order, dealing with $19,900. Bid Orders 3X Surpass the Ask Orders in Large Transactions Bitcoin buying demand far exceeds selling demand. Among the executed orders, the quantity of the bid orders is 1.41 times of the ask orders. The transaction volume of the bid orders is 1.82 times higher than the volume of the ask orders. At the same time, the larger the volume, the stronger the demand for bid orders. In large transactions greater than five Bitcoin, the number and the transaction volume of bid orders are as high as 275 and 2,781 Bitcoin, respectively. The number and the transaction volume of ask orders are 89 and 893 Bitcoin. Bitcoin orders amounts and volume comparison, Dec. 16. Source: tokeninsight.com Ethereum Keeps Tepid Nevertheless, is the price rise this time just a flash in the pan like before? From the perspective of Ethereum, reactions from the crypto market are seemingly not so hot. After Ethereum 2.0 launched officially, the price of ETH stabilized between $500 and $600, and it just went up by about 10% after 40 hours from Bitcoin breaking through $20,000, which is far lower than Bitcoin, and the highest daily trading volume is just $3.33 billion, not the highest level of this month. BTC price and historical trading volume in the last 30 days, chart from 9pm EST, Dec. 17. Source: tokeninsight.com ETH’s weekly performance is not shining like BTC either, and the trading volume of ETH’s spot and perpetual are just half of BTC’s volume approximately. Generally speaking, the fluctuation of ETH is more than BTC, but it is lower than BTC this week. When we think about the high correlation between them, this condition seems abnormal. What’s the future trend of the crypto market? Maybe the options markets’ performance can reveal some signs. BTC and ETH trading volume info of this week, chart from 9pm EST, Dec. 17. Source: tokeninsight.com Information From Futures, Options From Investors Futures and options are one kind of derivatives which imply future information, including investors’ thoughts for the futures markets, for both futures and options are executed someday after the buying day. Investors often buy futures and call options when they feel optimistic, and they will sell futures and buy put options when they have a cautious attitude to the market. The market is the aggregation of investors. Therefore, futures and options’ trading volumes are valid indicators for knowing the trend of the crypto market. Rising trading volume in the derivative market means investors have interests in the future, but shrinking trading volume means a more cautious view. BTC futures and perpetual options historical trading volume in the last 30 days, chart from 9pm EST, Dec. 17. Source: tokeninsight.com and skew.com When we have a look at the trading volume in last week, it is easy to find that investors’ confidence for the BTC is strengthened after Bitcoin hit $20,000: before that moment, the trading volume was lower than $25 billion per day on average, but after that, trading volume soared up to $80.4 billion. But we couldn\u0027t distinguish the future according to trading volume only. The open interest is another indicator often reflecting market participation. Compared with recent weeks, the open interest of Bitcoin futures reached a new peak after Bitcoin broke all-time high records, which implies the market\u0027s flourishing. BTC futures and perpetual options historical open interest in the last 30 days, chart from 9pm EST, Dec. 17. Source: tokeninsight.com and skew.com Moreover, let’s think about two vital indicators: funding rates and implied volatility. We have explained the meanings of them in the last market blog (Phoney Silence? Weekly Market Review by TokenInsight), so we will unscramble these indicators directly. Funding rates of BTC in the last 90 days, chart from 9pm EST, Dec. 17. Source: tokeninsight.com Compared with last week, the funding rate turns positive with a high rise, especially for the coin-margined contract. This indicates more investors are keeping a positive view for the future of the market, at least for the future of Bitcoin. Recent implied volatility surface of BTC options, chart from 7am EST, Dec. 17, Source: gvol.io Recent volatility surfaces reveal that investors tend to buy options. Combining volatility surfaces with funding rates, it is obvious that investors tend to buy call options, which can also prove investors’ confidence for the market. However, for the long term, the volatility surface reveals that investors still hold an optimistic but cautious attitude in general. Term structure of BTC options, chart from 7am EST, Dec. 17, Source: gvol.io The last but most vital information is from implied volatility’s term structure. These curves illustrate that investors show more confidence for short-term than long-term. In general, the next year’s implied volatility is upraised, which means that we will face a more fluctuant market in the future. Highlights Picked by TokenInsight Coinbase Submitted Files to SEC to go Public On Thursday (Dec. 17, 2020), U.S. major cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase confidentially filed preliminary documents, Form S-1, with SEC, getting ready for its initial public offering.

    "detailedContent": "What we will be covering today: This week, macroeconomic factors have had a significant impact on the crypto market. Due to relatively stable market expectations, the volatility of mainstream cryptos decreased significantly this week, and the speculative activity of derivatives decreased, but the transaction activity in the spot market increased. The impact of macroeconomic factors on the crypto market is concentrated in prices and does not affect volatility. The monthly retail sales rate in July was lower than expected, resulting in a short correction in the prices of mainstream cryptos. However, the good performance of jobless claims data at the beginning of last week and good information in the crypto industry stimulated investors\u0027 expectations to rise and asset prices to return to high levels. Regulatory and security incidents have a limited impact on the performance of mainstream cryptos this week. Subscribe Join us in showcasing the cryptocurrency revolution, one newsletter at a time. Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox, along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right, millions love us!) — what are you waiting for? Volatility Declined, While Market Expectations Remained After the volatility of cryptos stagnated last week, the volatility of the crypto market declined significantly this week. As of this Friday, the historical volatility of Bitcoin has dropped to below 60, and the historical volatility of Ethereum has dropped to below 80. Judging from the annual data, the current volatility of mainstream cryptos is basically the same as that in the first half of April, which means that the market volatility may be close to the bottom, and caution should be exercised in shorting volatility strategies. From the perspective of skewness, mainstream cryptos\u0027 neutral sentiment continues. However, it is worth noting that there has been a certain decline in forward skewness. Investors seem to be lowering forward expectations, and the rise in the probability of early marginal contraction of market liquidity is the main reason. The market expectations of the options sellers have remained at a relatively high level in the near future, and there has been no major change. From the perspective of the futures market, market expectations are also relatively stable: mainstream crypto futures products in major futures exchanges (Deribit, OKEX, FTX) have maintained a significant positive premium of about 7% to 9%, and even CME, an exchange dominated by traditional market investors with conservative investment styles, has also seen a positive premium of more than 3%. Macro Factors Still Dominate the Rhythm of Market This week, regulators were more active than last week, taking frequent actions on transaction compliance, but did not have a significant impact on the crypto market. Spain\u0027s National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and the People\u0027s Bank of China have punished some exchanges for unlicensed operations, trading, publicity, and other acts. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) issued a notice warning investors not to trade cryptos on platforms that do not hold an Australian Financial Services (AFS) license and pointed out that investing in crypto derivatives trading is too risky. Some Fed officials also expressed concern about the risks of trading cryptos at this week\u0027s Fed meeting. Iran\u0027s National Tax Administration (INTA) has put forward proposals on a new legal system for crypto trading, aiming to increase fiscal revenue through exchange compliance and taxation. Regulatory action against Binance continues: Binance is banned from operating in the Netherlands for its violation of various Dutch laws, according to a statement issued by the Dutch central bank on August 18. The Dutch central bank is likely to take action against Binance, but details are not yet clear. In addition, traders seeking compensation from Binance for service disruptions during market turmoil earlier this year have received financial support to prepare for one of the largest legal battles to date against the exchange. They have filed claims totaling more than $20M dollars against the exchange and hope to unite hundreds of traders. Binance is aggressively hiring a compliance team to deal with the situation. Chief executive Zhao Changpeng said the priority was to \"recruit people with compliance and regulatory experience\". The company is also seeking regular meetings with US officials. The US Treasury is preparing guidance to help define \"crypto brokers\", which could be published as early as next week. Some practitioners in the crypto industry have welcomed the regulation. They believe that stricter regulation of cryptos may stimulate the demand for cryptos. At present, due to the fear of fraud, the lack of supervision fees has prevented some investors from using cryptos, because not all investors are willing to bear the risk of fraud, which is not protected by law. The regulatory clampdown may lead to wider adoption of cryptos, because it will strengthen people\u0027s investment. This will affect the price of cryptos in a \"positive way\". Institutions are increasingly interested in investing in cryptos and crypto-related industries. Last weekend data showed that net short positions in bitcoin futures reached their lowest level since mid-May. Traders were forced to exit short positions in bitcoin and Ethereum and began to build long positions. The clear signs of improved demand in the futures market indicate that institutional demand for cryptos is rising. This week, Wells Fargo registered a private Bitcoin fund. Tech giants are beginning to lay out or strengthen their presence in the field of cryptos: Intel bought more than 3,000 shares of Coinbase for its first investment in the field of cryptos, while Facebook\u0027s crypto division has set its sights on third-party stable currency transactions. Crypto-related companies are widely favored: Bitpanda, the European crypto trading platform, raised $263M in a new round of financing and reached a valuation of $4.1B. 5 months ago, the company was worth only $1.2B. Bitcoin miner Iris Energy is expected to list on Nasdaq in the fourth quarter of 2021. Jefferies and Barclays have become joint book runners of London-listed miner Argo Blockchain. Coinbase announced this week that it will reinvest 10% of its profits in cryptos and is already preparing to buy $500M cryptos. In addition, Coinbase has teamed up with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group to create a crypto exchange in Japan that allows customers to use accounts with Mitsubishi Bank to buy and sell cryptos. On the macro-economic front, due to the spread of the epidemic again, the economic stimulus plan and liquidity supply have continued, which is beneficial to maintaining high prices of cryptos. Affected by the epidemic, the New Zealand Reserve Bank (RBNZ) decided to cancel the interest rate hike plan this week and keep the interest rate low. As a hawkish central bank, the RBNZ\u0027s attitude shows that in order to fight the epidemic, it will not tighten liquidity for the time being. Considering that the attitude of major western countries is generally more moderate than that of the RBNZ, the liquidity tightening is expected to ease somewhat. The number of first-time US jobless claims last week was 348K, the smallest increase since the week of March 14, 2020, and the fourth consecutive week of decline, indicating that employment growth was strong last month. The minutes of this week\u0027s Federal Reserve meeting pointed out that most people believe that a proportional reduction in the purchase of residential mortgage-backed securities and treasury bonds is beneficial. The decision to reduce debt has nothing to do with the timing of interest rate hikes, and the Federal Reserve may reach the threshold for reducing the scale of debt purchases this year. Most participants pointed out that the spread of the Delta virus could temporarily delay a full economic restart. Recent inflation data have been affected by supply bottlenecks and labor shortages and are likely to be temporary. Rosengren, chairman of the Boston Federal Reserve, said he would support a reduction in bond purchases starting next month, as large-scale bond purchases are not suitable for the US. On the same day, Brad, chairman of the St Louis Fed, said he would prefer to reduce the scale of bond purchases in the first quarter of 2022. The Fed is expected to allow the balance sheet to be reduced after the reduction is completed, allowing market pricing to control long-term credit markets. The fourth quarter of 2022 is a reasonable time to raise interest rates. Although the Fed Taper (tightening liquidity) is expected to advance, the first phase of measures to reduce debt-based, only to tighten marginal liquidity, the near-term impact on asset prices is small. However, as the economy recovers, future scale reductions and even interest rate hikes will have a significant impact on crypto prices. Next week, PMI data from major developed countries, consumer confidence index, and the new issue of US jobless claims will be released one by one, further judgment on macroeconomic trends will become the core factor affecting the expectations of crypto investors, and next week\u0027s monthly derivatives delivery will also push up market volatility together with macro factors.

    "detailedContent": "This week, we have witnessed the highest volatility of the crypto asset market this year. As of 11:00 on May 21, the historical volatility of Bitcoin perpetual contracts in the crypto asset market has risen to 181.3, and that of Ethereum has reached an \"horrific\" 252.86, which have separated obviously from the historical volatility of spot index prices, rare in the history of crypto assets. Ethereum spot index price and perpetual contract historical volatility, source: gvol.io The market has stabilized from the temporary panic, as of 14:00 on May 21, the price of Bitcoin dropped to $29,000 and was stable near $40,000, and Ethereum has also successfully maintained at $2,500, however, a large number of contract liquidations, selling pressure caused by panic selling, DeFi serial liquidation and other information still make investors feel lingering. Even the \"industry giant V\" Justin Sun has even been liquidated away from his 600,000 ETH position; it can be said that May 19 is the \"darkest time\" in this bull market in the crypto asset market.

Has the bull market ended? What factors caused the sudden panic and plunge in the market? We found some clues through a variety of data indicators.

Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox, along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right, millions love us!) — what are you waiting for? Is There Widespread Panic in the Market? Indeed, there was a panic in the market, but this time it did not trigger a \"widespread panic.\" Speculators placed a great amount of bets on perpetual, and the market performance often reflects the mood of speculators. In terms of trading volume, the market trading volume is basically the same as the large-scale fluctuations at the end of February: taking Bitcoin as an example, the market perpetual volume on February 23 and 24 reached more than $370 billion, and this time the perpetual trading volume was around $320 billion, not the highest this year. The possible reason is that the market has established expectations of a decline in a long-term sideways market. Therefore, the scale of panic selling is relatively limited in this decline. The greater possibility for the growing trading volume is perpetual liquidation. Of course, the sell-off is not non-existent: as of 15:00 on May 21, Bitcoin perpetual holdings fell to $15.6 billion, a 29.54% drop compared to last week, slightly higher than the weekly price fluctuations of around 21%. It shows that some investors have chosen to liquidate their positions in a highly volatile market, but overall, the decline in market positions has not been significant, and has not reached the standard of \"significant impact\". Changes in the trading volume of Bitcoin perpetual in the past 90 days, as of 15:00 on May 21, source: tokeninsight.com On the other hand, the amount of liquidation confirms the view of \"limited panic\". Before the large-scale liquidation on May 19, the scale of liquidation caused by the sharp drop on April 17 was actually relatively larger: Bitcoin fell from around $62,000 to $55,000. The long and short sides combined liquidation exceeds $10 billion. At this time, expectations for a decline have been established; there is consensus that there will be a callback in the market in mid-year. Due to the early release of pressure, the liquidation volume on May 19 was less than $8.6 billion, which largely avoided the liquidity crisis and even further chain reactions caused by excessive market liquidation. Changes in the daily settlement amount of perpetual in the whole market in the past 90 days, source: bybt.com In the spot market, there was the second peak on May 19th since the beginning of January: the day after the price fell, the transaction volume of Bitcoin reached $45.64 billion, and the spot transaction volume of all-market tokens reached $232.3 billion. There seems to be a massive sale, but it is not. While a large number of individual investors choose to sell digital assets, some European and American investment institutions and individual investors who intend to \"buy the dip\". The large number of buying and selling operations that day pushed up the trading volume, and of course it also dysfunctioned exchanges: Binance and Coinbase both experienced varying degrees of trading congestion and downtime due to excessive data processing and liquidation. However, with the combined efforts of liquidity providers, market makers, quantitative hedge funds, exchanges, and even individual investors, the liquidity of the digital asset market has not been significantly affected. Changes in the trading volume of the digital asset spot market in the past 90 days, source: tokeninsight.com From the perspective of capital inflow/outflow, after the 19th, the capital in mainstream digital asset markets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum is actually in a state of inflow. Within 24 hours, the inflow of funds in the Bitcoin market reached $250 million, and Ethereum reached $330 million. On the whole, the outflow of Bitcoin funds in the past month, the inflows of the high-yield digital asset market such as Ethereum has not changed, and the market value of Bitcoin still remains below 45%. Cash net inflows/net outflows of Bitcoin and Ethereum in the past 30 days, source: tokeninsight.com What Is FOMO? The inflow and outflow of funds in different exchanges within 24 hours also revealed the regional nature of panic and selling. On Binance, Huobi, OKEx and other exchanges, the Bitcoin market is in a state of outflow or close to outflow; the sell-off is dominated by small amounts. A large number of users of the three exchanges are from East Asia, and Huobi and OKEx exchanges account for the majority. Changes in Bitcoin market capital flow on Binance, Huobi, and OKEx exchanges in the past 24 hours, source: tokeninsight.com On the contrary, Coinbase, FTX, and Bitstamp exchanges where European and American investors are concentrated, all investors are buying Bitcoin, and the net inflow of funds is very obvious. On the Ethereum market, most mainstream exchanges have shown a significant inflow of funds except Binance. It is the same as the past 30 days. The above information shows that the selling pressure in the Bitcoin market is likely to come from East Asia, and the impact on Ethereum is small. There has been an abnormal movement in the Bitcoin market. What happened in East Asia? Changes in Bitcoin market capital flow on Coinbase, FTX, and Bitstamp in the past 24 hours, source: tokeninsight.com The outflow of funds in the Bitcoin market of East Asia exchanges in the past 30 days/The inflow of funds in the Bitcoin market of exchanges in Europe and the United States in the past 30 days, source: tokeninsight.com What Happened Around May 19th? It is easy to find that the crowds of panic selling mainly come from East Asia. Let us sort out the background of the incident: Since the bull market began, one of the largest stock markets in Asia has seen a large amount of net outflows. Among them, the large outflow of funds from public funds has continued, with an average daily outflow of $2.44 billion. The large number of fund redemptions from the beginning of the year may be an important influencing factor. Where did the money go? In the past month, Bitcoin on the Binance exchange has received approximately $83 billion, while Huobi and OKEx have received nearly $30 billion. It is just Bitcoin. If you calculate the derivatives market, the amount of funds inflows in the entire digital asset market is surprisingly amazing, of which a large amount of funds inflows come from East Asia. In contrast, since the beginning of this year, the amount of funds raised within the stock market has plummeted: From the closure of mining in Inner Mongolia, to the bank\u0027s warning that digital asset transactions will be restricted and the industry association issuing a document requiring restrictions on digital asset transactions, the darkest moment on May 19 may have been brewing for a long time. As for why the digital asset market is suddenly \"regulated\", the changes in the traditional market may give us some clues. After Darkness: The Market Is Still in a High-Risk Phase It is true that on May 19, the digital asset market as a whole was not severely hit. However, as the Fed considers the impact of factors such as stopping QE, raising rates, and high inflation, the funds flowing into the digital asset market may gradually flow out in the future, and even pierce the bubble and end the bull market under the influence of certain major events. But it is still too early to announce the end of the bull market . However, the current volatility gap continues to be positive and has expanded, indicating that high volatility and downward trends are still in the process; considering the predictive effect of the volatility gap on market performance, the digital asset market has a high risk situation in the coming days. Market confidence needs time to recover; and from the expectations of professional investors, the time required for the market to return to the normal level during the bull market (2 trillion US dollars in market cap) may take longer than expected. Risk expectations and control will become the core themes of investors in recent days and even weeks.

    "title": "How Regulations May Affect the Mining Industry: A Data Perspective by IntoTheBlock",
    "detailedContent": "Every week, IntoTheBlock brings you on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. How Regulations May Affect the Mining Industry During this past week BTC prices have recorded a significant positive rise in price, despite the unclear regulatory outcomes in the U.S. Congress. In this article we will explore the potential path ahead for Bitcoin analyzing on-chain data. Moreover, we will assess the coming one trillion U.S. infrastructure deal, its implications on crypto and the direct effects it could have over the U.S. mining industry. This past week the crypto market has been experiencing a rise in price, BTC surpassed the $43K noted resistance. Generally led by a continued bull run from the past couple weeks, BTC price currently sits around $46K and IntoTheBlock’s In and Out of the Money Around Price (IOMAP) indicator marks the $49K point as the next spot where high volume of transactions were registered on-chain. As of Aug. 11, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin Financial metrics The IOMAP reveals that 178.31k addresses had previously bought approximately 433.53k Bitcoin at a price around $43,000. Due to the large buying activity around this area, there is expected to be strong support from new buyers and current holders. On the other hand, there is strong resistance around $50,000. The high amount of volume that was previously bought there (289.49k BTC) is expected to create selling pressure as many holders tend to look to sell positions at a break-even level. On Tuesday, the U.S. Senate gave an uncommon bipartisan approval to the $1Trillion infrastructure bill, intended to rebuild the country’s roads, bridges, airports and waterways, one of President Biden’s top priorities in agenda. The bill with great approval of The Senate, having a voting count of 69 to 30, now moves onto the House of Representatives where they will be discussing its implications in order to take a final vote on it. Senator Portman, originally introduced the provision in the infrastructure bill. This bill gives U.S. crypto entities new regulations. The bill requires that all operating U.S. crypto broker entities report transaction data to the IRS. The problem is that the specific definition for crypto “brokers” was not included in the provision. Without this clear definition, anyone operating a mining operation, staking on a proof of stake protocol or even developers creating cryptocurrencies may fit under these new regulations. Senator Portman addressed these concerns, stating that language in the bill should not be interpreted this broadly and that work should be done to clarify the exemption of miners and stakers. A group of senators in between them Cynthia Lummis introduced a new amendment last Wednesday night, in which clear clarification was given that only trading desks or entities with a similar function will be in the obligation to follow this reporting regulations. Even though this amendment was introduced last Wednesday the Senate voted in favor of passing the deal without any amendments being done; meaning no changes will be introduced to the provision and now is up to the House of Representatives to decide whether or not to continue with the deal. At IntoTheBlock we have been monitoring some indicators regarding this new regulation\u0027s effects. Particularly, this is likely to have a significant impact on the mining industry, which has been growing within the U.S. following China’s crackdown. The Hash Rate is the total speed at which mining machines are operating to solve the mathematical puzzle that validates transactions in a block. This indicator shown below is the estimated aggregate computational power (measured in Terahash per second) provided by miners to operate a given network. As of Aug. 10, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s mining indicators Since its May high of 188.04m TH/s the mining industry was seen heavily affected by the China mining ban recording a low of 62.03m TH/s on June 27. Many mining activity immigrated to the U.S, specifically to the state of Texas. This makes the current legislation discussion of prime importance to the mining sector, as miners would fit under the new “brokers” definition and would have to be regulated as such. The hash rate indicator has recorded a slow but steady recovery, and continues to show positive signs regardless of the current discussion surring mining in the U.S. congress. On the other hand, Miner Reserves point to signs of concern.The miner reserves indicator shows the aggregate balances of addresses belonging to mining pools. Typically having correlation with the hash rate indicator during the May highs and the China ban. The indicator showed a clear divergence last week when the largest yearly drop in miner reserves took place. As of Aug. 10, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s mining indicators Recording a high reserve of 2.12 million BTC on May 20th, after being impacted by the massive sell off the miners reserves now hold 1.97 million BTC, representing a decrease of -7.08%. This suggests that miners could be anticipating headwinds in the coming months as crypto legislation in the infrastructure bill is finalized. Therefore, the decrease in miner reserves could be related to American miners selling, taking precautions against potentially stringent regulation. The hash rate distribution indicator shows the concentration of hash rate by mining pools. During the China ban, pools created from Chinese entities were seen heavily affected, impacting their presence in the global hash rate distribution. As of Aug. 10, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s mining indicators During the beginning of May before the China ban implementations, the huobi.pool had a 5.03% of the total hash rate distribution and was mining about 10 blocks per day. Currently after most miners were thrown away from China the pool has a 2.63% of the total hash rate distribution, mining about 5 blocks per day. In the same way Chinese pools have decreased their presence in the total hash rate distribution, a now-significant share of unknown miners pools keep growing. Having many miners being relocated in Texas makes again the future of the industry unstable, which could lead to similar outcomes in the U.S. if regulatory clarity is not provided properly. While it is clear that implementing the infrastructure deal without any new amendments to clarify the cryptocurrency regulations could be a setback, it is important to acknowledge how far the industry has come in just a little over 12 years. During this year the cryptocurrency market cap managed to reach two trillion dollars during the month of April. New legislation is being brought up in Washington in order to clarify and bring clarity into the complex nascent industry.

    "title": "Key Metrics Pointing to Where Crypto May Be Heading Next: A Data Perspective by IntoTheBlock",
    "detailedContent": "Every week, IntoTheBlock brings you on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. Key Metrics Pointing to Where Crypto May Be Heading Next Crypto markets have traded within a narrow range the past few weeks, following the precipitous crash in mid-May. As market participants struggle to take the lead in either direction, news and blockchain indicators may provide valuable insights into what is likely to come next for the crypto space. In terms of news, probably the most relevant recent occurrence is the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) clarification that it will not be banning crypto trading. It had been rumored for multiple months that the RBI would be making it difficult for both institutions and individuals to access crypto and they have cleared up that will not be the case. Following the recent crackdown in China, this comes as a relief for the crypto market. In other news, Google has reversed its stance on advertising from crypto exchanges and wallets. Although crypto entities looking to advertise on Google will still need to be registered with the financial regulators FinCEN, this is a step forward from banning all crypto-related ads in June 2018. Both of these news signal positive developments for crypto. Similarly, on-chain data points to bullish activity following the crash. By looking at the variations in profitability, we are able to identify that buying activity is taking place. The Historical In/Out of the Money (HIOM) does just this, breaking down the number of addresses profiting over time. As of June 2, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin financial metrics Comparing Bitcoin versus ten days ago when it traded slightly higher, we observe two interesting patterns. First, the number of addresses in the money (making profits) is 900k greater, even though the price is currently lower. This points to a large number of holders taking the crash to $30,000 as an opportunity to buy and lower their average costs, thus making them profitable as prices rebounded. Second, the number of addresses out of the money decreased by nearly one million. Though some of these averaged down their entry price, it is also likely that many panic sold, realizing their losses and no longer being considered by the HIOM. This marks the transition in Bitcoin holding from short-term speculators into longer-term investors. The pattern is apparent when looking at the decrease in addresses holding for less than a month, classified as traders by IntoTheBlock. As of June 2, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin ownership metrics The decrease in short-term trading comes as investors become uncertain about where Bitcoin may be heading next in the near-term. Using data on addresses’ profitability we can also determine points of support and resistance for Bitcoin’s trajectory. Addresses’ profitability directly impacts buy and sell orders set by investors. Using on-chain data, IntoTheBlock’s In/Out of the Money Around Price (IOMAP) groups clusters of addresses depending on whether they are profitable (in the money) or losing money (out of the money), at least on paper. The largest clusters of addresses represent at which price the most volume of Bitcoin had previously been bought, and directly influences near-term support and resistance levels. As of June 2, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin financial metrics The IOMAP reveals that 1 million addresses had previously bought approximately 570K Bitcoin at a price around $37,000. Due to the large buying activity around this area, there is expected to be strong support from new buyers and current holders. Were this level to fail, then a drop to $34,000 is likely. On the other hand, there is strong resistance just below $40,000. The high amount of volume that was previously bought there (320K BTC) is expected to create selling pressure as many holders tend to look to sell positions at a break-even level. Moreover, if buyers are able to get Bitcoin beyond this range, a move to $43,000 seems probable as there appears to be little resistance in between. Due to the high concentration of volume currently near price, it is likely that price may continue range-bound, unless there is a major catalyst in either direction. Finally, it is probable that a breakout in either direction for Bitcoin will lead the rest of the crypto markets along. As of June 2, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Ethereum financial metrics This is the case as correlations to Bitcoin have been increasing across the board. In Ether’s case, the correlation with Bitcoin is back to 0.9, pointing to a strong positive relationship between the two, after being negatively correlated for a short period of time. Overall, crypto is at a critical point where people debate whether or not the bull market is over. With positive news and buying activity picking up momentum, it is possible that the worst may be behind us. However, it is too early to discount a move lower if Bitcoin prices drop below $36,000, which would drag the rest of the market along with it.

    "detailedContent": "Oracles play a uniquely important role in the crypto world, particularly in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space — in simplest terms, an oracle is the messenger that brings real-world data to smart contracts. CoinMarketCap, the world’s leading source for digital asset market data in the rapidly growing crypto space, has partnered with DIA to provide CMC data as an oracle. DIA is an ecosystem for open-source financial data, aiming to provide a reliable bridge between off-chain data and smart contracts. ‍Oracles provide fuel that gives smart contracts the data that they need to execute: the fuel of information. Through DIA, CMC’s digital asset market data — also accessible via an API — will now be available through the DIA platform as an oracle, providing yet another gateway to bring CMC data feeds directly to smart contracts. As the DeFi space experienced wild growth through the “DeFi summer wave,” the market’s need for accurate and timely data has only grown. Beyond APIs, oracles are needed more than ever to provide smart contracts with the relevant price data. CoinMarketCap’s oracle will be able to provide data for DeFi applications ranging from lending protocols to management dashboards, all of which will benefit from access to CMC’s accurate data. DIA will initially include CoinMarketCap’s top 50 crypto assets, as well as the top 25 DeFi assets. DIA has the option for its users to customize the setup of the oracle by increasing the data frequency, as well as change the breadth and depth of asset data as needed. The CoinMarketCap data oracle can be easily accessed by visiting the DIA documentation here, and following the implementation guide.",

    "title": "Bitcoin\u0027s Price Recovers as Exchange Outflows Spike: A Data Perspective by IntoTheBlock",
    "detailedContent": "Every week, IntoTheBlock brings you on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. Bitcoin\u0027s Price Recovers as Exchange Outflows Spike During these past weeks the crypto market has experienced market changing events. Several tech companies started looking deeply into the blockchain arena, and Google loosening measures for crypto platforms to advertise on their search engine. Between these and the anticipation of Ethereum’s hard fork upgrade, prices of several tokens rose and retested levels not seen since May. In this article we are going to explore several indicators that reflect and may have been linked to the recent momentum in crypto markets, specifically in Bitcoin. As of Aug. 3, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s capital markets insights The price performance indicator clearly shows the market awakening from what many were calling a bear market. There are several other indicators that clearly show patterns that reflect this change in sentiment, such as flows of crypto in and out of exchanges. The exchange analytics on IntoTheBlock provide an overview of on-chain transfers to and from centralized exchanges. This allows users to see how many tokens are being transferred to and from the exchanges selected. This also provides insights into the market sentiment by providing an idea of how traders are allocating their holdings. The Net Flows indicator highlights the total sum of traders sending money in and out of exchanges. The indicator shows the sum of tokens received minus tokens leaving exchanges. On the indicator negative values will represent the excess of outflows relative to inflows, while positive values represent the greater amounts of inflows into exchanges. As of Aug. 3, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin exchange metrics This indicator gives insights into the market positioning. People withdrawing tokens from exchanges are probably looking to hold their tokens into the future, and looking for higher safety or yield on top of their crypto-assets. For instance, users may prefer to store their holdings in cold wallet storage, while others prefer to lend out their holdings through different centralized or decentralized lending platforms to earn interest. Whereas people sending tokens to exchanges are probably looking into trading the tokens and mostly taking profits, in which we usually see negative price fluctuations. During the recent price fluctuations on July 28th 2021 the indicator recorded a low point in which 32.98K BTC left the exchanges addresses. Tokens leaving exchanges pass onto an illiquid trading state, the higher this illiquid state the more demand there will be for the liquid trading tokens. Liquid trending tokens are categorized as the ones sitting on exchanges. The more people are withdrawing their tokens from exchanges the less available liquid tokens there are to buy. The outflow volume indicator shows the amount of tokens leaving exchanges, in this case BTC. This is helpful to track big token withdrawals and try to anticipate market volatility. As of Aug. 3, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin exchange metrics During this recent price breakthrough the indicator showed a clear correlation between price and the outflow volume. Using IntoTheBlock’s data for the month of July we obtain a 30-day correlation of 0.33 between Bitcoin’s outflow volume and its price, suggesting a moderately high positive relationship between the two. While keeping track of the exchange analytics area is important, the on-chain transaction activity is equally as significant. The transaction volume indicator allows us to see spikes of on-chain activity which usually tend to come hand in hand with price fluctuations. As of Aug. 3, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin network metrics During the recent break-out the indicator showed a clear relation of the on-chain recorded transactions and the price fluctuation. This is important to keep into account since high transaction volume activity together with an increase in price are typically signs that represent strength and health in the market. During the last price fluctuations the indicator recorded a significant spike on the transaction volume activity. Clear evidence is shown of the relation and connection of different sectors of the industry to price fluctuations. It can be seen how specific indicators showed signs of confidence during the market momentum experienced recently. Keeping track of the indicators over time helps spot reversals and break-outs.

    "detailedContent": "Every week, IntoTheBlock brings you on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. NFTs Reach New Highs With OpenSea Burning Millions Worth of ETH By now you have probably heard about non-fungible tokens (NFTs). NFTs are often associated with digital art, but they are much more than that. This article covers the impressive resurgence of the NFT market, their possible future usability and how it is likely to continue to affect Ethereum’s ecosystem following the London hard fork. After much anticipation, Ethereum’s London hard fork upgrade took place on Aug. 5. Along with it five different improvement proposals were implemented, EIP-1559 being the most awaited. This has the potential to fundamentally transform the way ETH is valued. While many claimed NFTs were “dead” following their breakout in the first quarter of 2021, recent on-chain action proves they are alive and better than ever. As we’ll get into, NFT prices have rocketed past previous highs and their share of the total amount of blockchain activity has increased significantly marking as well important milestones for NFT platform aggregator OpenSea. The significance of NFTs on Ethereum is evident on gas costs, recording significant gas price rises in correlation with major NFT drops. As of Aug.16, 2021 through ITB\u0027s network insights The NFT space has quickly become dominated by drops, where a collection of verifiably-scarce digital pieces are tokenized and sold on the blockchain. These drops can range from acclaimed artists’ artwork to machine-generated patterns to, of course, cats and penguins. Most recently, we’ve seen several drops take over Ethereum gas fees. CyberKongz VX, which consists of monkey theme art works, last Sunday led average hourly gas prices all the way up to 414 Gwei, burning more than 1,200 Eth in 5 hours. This brought the project all the way to first place on the leaderboard in terms of addresses with more burned fees. A major player benefiting from the increased appetite for NFTs has been OpenSea. The NFT marketplace aggregator, which recently raised a $100 million series B valuing the project at 1.5 billion, broke all-time high volumes in July and consecutively is already at its highest monthly volume half way into August, more than tripling the total volume reached for the entire month of July. This indicator clearly depicts the large extent of the market rise the NFT space has experienced. From July 2020 to the end of July 2021, the protocol has managed to increase its volume by an astonishing 30,000%. The growth of the protocol is also clear on the Ethereum ecosystem, being one of the main burners since the implementation. Alex Atallah, Co-founder and CTO of OpenSea manifested the company\u0027s success through his twitter account, letting the community know that the protocol passed for the first time $1 billion in volume for the month of August overcoming respected e-commerce company Etsy. Source: Twitter Atallah also hinted at one of the protocol’s goals: to surpass eBay on sales volume. EBay’s volume aggregate for Q2 2021 totaled $22.11 billion in comparison to OpenSea ,which processed approximately $382 million. Despite the fact that it still looks like a shy number in comparison with giant e-commerce eBay, it\u0027s important to keep into account that OpenSea numbers have shown impressive growth during the months of July and August, surpassing the aggregate of all previous months. In this same aspect, eBay’s platform currently offers a wide variety of products with broad usability features, and it\u0027s impressive that the nascent NFT’s industry has already reached such impressive numbers with limited usability products. This developing industry is projected to offer a diverse range of digital products and services, indirectly competing with physical ones offered by eBay or Amazon. The increased speculation in NFTs has on multiple occasions led to prohibitively high fees for Ethereum users. This is likely to still be the case, as EIP-1559 was not meant to decrease fees (this was a somewhat common misconception). While users will still have to wait for broader layer 2 adoption for lower fees, at least now holders are aligned with demand for network usage. This is the case as the majority of fees paid in transactions are now burned, effectively reducing the net amount of ETH inflation by simply buying NFTs. Currently 1.7 million ETH are speculated to be burned this year with the integration of EIP-1559, bringing the net inflation down to 3.1%. As of Aug. 16, 2021 using ITB\u0027s Ethereum network indicators As previously mentioned, the increase in gas fees on Ethereum was closely related to NFTs in general. The Indicator shows the total amount paid in fees to use the blockchain on a given day. During the last month it recorded an increase of nearly 140%, with a high of 7.65k ETH on Aug. 10 when VOX NFTs dropped. A clear correlation is also visible between the dates of expected NFTs releases, visible on the first indicator of this article, and the aggregate total fees. Through ultrasound.money\u0027s burn leaderboard, we can see that two of the four highest burning addresses are related to NFTs — which again shows clear evidence of the importance of NFTs in the Ethereum network. Ultrasound.money source The NFT market is proving doubters and naysayers wrong. While there are still many people that might not fully understand them, NFTs have brought to prominence the rise of digital art, collectibles and enable novel business models such as Axie\u0027s play-to-earn or Stoner Cats TV pass. NFTs have a high potential to create demand for more people to enter the crypto space through these diverse use-cases. The developing industry gives prominent conditions for antique traditional industries to evolve in the space. Following EIP-1559, supply-side economics also favor Ethereum holders as ETH is burnt every time an NFT is bought. Ultimately, this reinforces Ether\u0027s monetary \"soundness\" and is a major step as Ethereum continues to grow.

    "detailedContent": "Every week, IntoTheBlock brings you on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. On-Chain Analysis of China’s Crypto Crackdown Crypto markets have experienced a highly volatile month, even by crypto’s standards. Following last week’s FUD from Elon Musk, the past seven days have been filled with panic from retail traders, arising mostly from China taking measures in crypto. Despite the despair from traders seeing crypto prices crash, the reality is most of this \"news\" from China was simply reiterations of China’s stance since 2017, as covered by The Block. The only new measures discussed come from inner Mongolia making a proposal to restrict mining and mitigate energy consumption in the Chinese autonomous region. A mix of these news and some rumors ignited a crash across crypto markets, taking as much as $1 trillion from the total crypto market cap. While most crypto-assets dropped over 30% within a week, they remain for the most part with double- or triple-digit returns year-to-date. The regulatory uncertainty in China has certainly taken a hit on crypto. However, this may not seem as negative as it seems at first glance. For one, the high allocation of hash rate in China has been seen by many as a centralization risk for Bitcoin over the past few years. As well, the use of coal power plants to mine Bitcoin has been criticized, notably with Tesla no longer accepting Bitcoin payments due to their alleged environmental impact. The recent measures from the Chinese government, though they may cause headwinds short-term, would potentially reduce both of these issues. In other words, Bitcoin mining could end up being more decentralized and environmentally friendly as a result of this so-called \"crack-down.\" Another point of concern that has been mentioned recently is that existing miners may be looking to sell as a result of these measures. The reality is, though, that while some miners do have decently-sized Bitcoin holdings, the amount they accrue on a daily basis is negligible relative to the total amount of Bitcoin traded. The graph above displays the percentage that daily mining rewards represent out of the total on-chain volume. As evidenced from this graph, the volume share pertaining to miners has constantly declined, sitting currently around 0.03% out of the total Bitcoin blockchain volume. While miners that have held Bitcoin for years may still be able to impact Bitcoin’s price, the data shows that the marginal effect that they can have by selling has decreased significantly. As the share of volume attributed to miners decreased, the amount trading in centralized exchanges continues to grow. For this reason, a full crackdown on Chinese centralized exchanges is likely to have a higher impact than banning mining. This trend may have started as OKEx and Huobi began limiting service to Chinese users, citing “recent dynamic changes in the market.” These measures directly impacted on-chain activity with Bitcoin outflows from these exchanges hitting new yearly highs. As of May 26 via IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin exchange flows The increase in outflows from OKEx and Huobi point to users withdrawing significant amounts of Bitcoin. This could be the result of people anticipating stronger measures from the Chinese government, and may lead to some short-term panic. The past couple of weeks have served to show that China may be taking serious measures in the crypto space. While many of these have simply been reiterations of previous statements, there does seem to be some action as shown with the proposal to restrict mining in inner Mongolia or the measures taken by centralized exchanges. Even though this has created near-term uncertainty, these may end up being beneficial long-term for Bitcoin and crypto in general. A Chinese crackdown on mining results in broader, more decentralized dispersion of hash rate, while also removing some of the players that consume the most coal in the process. Despite this, the spotlight remains on both Chinese miners and exchanges, but more so with the latter. Ultimately, though the markets have settled down so far, they await clarity before heading higher.

    "detailedContent": "Back in May, we launched our price estimate feature that allows all of our users to guess the price of their favorite coins. Lots of our users participated in the estimates and contributed to the price prediction model we designed. After a few months of data collection, we are launching a new price estimate dashboard along with the leaderboard and personal estimate page! What Is the Price Estimate Dashboard? We’ve collected the data submitted from our users since May in order to calculate some key statistics for you to browse. On this new page, we display the top six popular coins that most of our users make predictions for, and the stats for these hot coins. We also list those coins our users made the best estimations for in the past month — the ranking is based on how accurately users estimated. From here, users can go to individual coins or tokens to view the estimation details or make new estimates. We hope that you can find some interesting inspiration for your next investment move! What Is the Leaderboard? Among all the users making predictions, we calculate an estimation score for each user and rank them in the leaderboard. This estimation score is calculated based on a user’s closest estimates, average estimate accuracy as well as the coverage of estimates for the past six months. The more coins you predict — and the better you predict — could get you at a higher position on the leaderboard! If you are interested in seeing other users\u0027 predictions, simply click on the username and check the stats! Please note this leaderboard updates once a month. Check where you are right now and don’t lose any time to try to rank higher in the next month! What Is the Personal Estimate Page? You might have placed lots of estimates from time to time, and it’s hard to keep track of all the estimates made before. Don’t worry, we consolidated your estimates and key statistics on one page for you! On this page, users can view their own estimated statistics and the accuracy chart calculated from the past six months of data. Users are also able to view a list of coins and tokens that they have placed the estimates for a specific month. Potential Future Developments Soon, we’ll be introducing the daily task and leaderboard award for you to collect more CoinMarketCap Diamonds!",

    "title": "What Is the Best Time to Transact on Ethereum?: Flipside Crypto",
    "detailedContent": "We\u0027ve got some time before Ethereum fees get cheaper. Transaction fees on the Ethereum network have been increasing rapidly since late July 2020, when “the Summer DeFi Boom” visibly started. But the network congestion caused by increasing demand in DeFi did not end with the summer — it has only gotten worse. On Jan. 4 of this year, Ethereum fees reached an average of $17.44 per transaction. And while Ethereum has started tackling the issue — the transition to a faster proof-of-stake mining algorithm could take years to complete. In the meantime, it’s best to avoid 2-6PM UTC. We broke down daily Ethereum fees by the hour, to highlight the best times to transact per region. The box plot above shows average fees per day in 2020 for every hour. The bars are where most of the data falls. The black dots are outliers. The data clearly shows fees are at their highest between 2-6pm UTC. The best times to transact are instead between 1AM-3AM, 5AM-8AM, and 9PM to 11PM UTC. Who Is Causing These Spikes in Fees? 💸 Whales or Smaller Wallets? By looking at the transactions happening on Ethereum, we were able to find that Ethereum whales were transacting far more than smaller wallets. We defined whales as wallets that held over 20 ETH (~ USD 26,600 at the time of writing) throughout 2020. These larger wallets’ transaction activity coincided throughout with fee surges (first graph above). 🌍 Where Are They Located? We also checked to see if accounts in Asia were more active than in North America, and we found that both regions have about the same amount of activity.

    "detailedContent": "Aave bounties, a scavenger hunt and more are coming to Flipside Crypto. But before we’re visited by this friendly ghost, it’s time to check in on the latest news for the decentralized lending protocol. Last time we talked Aave, we took a closer look at the basics of the protocol and its quickly increasing TVL. So what’s the latest for the protocol? It includes expansion to new protocols and offerings, as well as an all-time high in price. Let’s take a closer look. Aave Explores Expansion We’ll start with a look at the recent talk of expansion for Aave onto Layer 2 networks, as well as Solana. According to reports, Aave founder and CEO Stani Kulechov confirmed recently that the company was investigating a multichain strategy. That strategy would not only include Layer 2 protocols such as Avalanche, Arbitrum and Optimism, but also Solana. The reports were met with a generally positive response, especially from Solana and its devotees. ETH Twitter on the Way? Layer 2 expansion isn’t the only new offering in the works for Aave. According to reports, Kulechov is also said to be “on a mission” to develop an alternative to Twitter using the Ethereum blockchain. Known as “ETHlend,” the idea first gained attention in 2017 as a non-custodial, decentralized lending protocol. Now, Kulechov says, the idea has shifted. In this new offering, users would be able to earn money by interacting on a social media site that would follow in the vein of microblogging site Twitter. An ATH for AAVE Perhaps most exciting for those in the ecosystem was the increase in demand that took place earlier this month, leading to an all-time high price for AAVE, the platform’s native token. As Cointelegraph noted, traders seemed to take word of AAVE’s in Bitwise Investment’s new investment vehicle as auspicious news. As a result, AAVE’s price surged by nearly 10% to reach $333.84 on Aug. 6 and continued its upside momentum into the following days. TVL, or total value locked, was already at high levels in the months leading up to this spike, as we profiled earlier this year. In recent weeks, however, TVL also surged to record levels.

    "title": "Ethereum ATH Propelled by Exchange Outflows \u0026 Institutional Activity: A Data Perspective by IntoTheBlock",
    "detailedContent": "Every week, IntoTheBlock brings you on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. This week, we analyze leading indicators that have been pushing Ethereum to new highs even as Bitcoin retraces. Through an on-chain lens, we are able to identify some of the factors that may be behind Ether’s performance. Ethereum Exchange Outflows Reach Record Levels Due to the blockchain’s transparency, crypto analytics platforms such as IntoTheBlock are able to monitor funds flowing in and out of exchanges. Given the relevance of exchanges in crypto, these flows can be very relevant to identify market trends. In the past week, Ether’s exchange outflows relative to its inflows reached its highest level to date. Net Flows — which subtract exchange deposits (inflows) minus withdrawals (outflows) — surpassed $1 billion on Jan. 22; that is $1 billion more Ether was withdrawn than deposited into centralized exchanges. As of Jan. 26, 2021 through IntoTheBlock’s Ethereum exchange flows Generally, large exchange outflows suggest investors opting to move their funds out of centralized venues into (self) custody or other applications. This could be interpreted as a bullish signal, as funds outside centralized exchanges are typically harder or more expensive to sell. Moreover, the withdrawal of these funds mean that there is now $1 billion less Ether available to be sold in centralized exchanges. The continuous withdrawal of Ether taking place could even lead to what is known as a sell-side liquidity crisis, where the lack of funds available to be sold ends up causing prices to spike. That could very well have had something to do with Ether’s recent all-time high as its mid-price grew nearly 20% following the sizable outflows. Ether Institutional Demand Leading the Way As recently covered in Coinbase’s 2020 Review, institutional investing in Ether is picking up. Blockchain data supports this claim. At IntoTheBlock we closely follow Large Transactions Volume — the aggregate volume spent in transfers of over $100,000 in value — as a proxy to institutional activity. This value has been increasing throughout 2020 and at an even faster rate in 2021. As of Jan. 26, 2021 through IntoTheBlock’s Ethereum financial indicators Large transaction volume in 2021 has surpassed $10 billion per day on multiple occasions. On Jan. 22, the day with over $1 billion in net outflows, $10.7 billion in large transactions was recorded on the Ethereum blockchain, pointing to institutional demand driving Ether’s price. Short-Term Trading Also at Yearly Highs Given the high amount of interest picking up for Ethereum, a significant portion of its total volume and holders has changed hands over the past month. IntoTheBlock classifies as traders those addresses that have held a crypto-asset for under 30 days. The number of traders for Ether reached a multi-year high. As of Jan. 26, 2021 through IntoTheBlock’s Ethereum financial indicators More remarkable, though, is the total volume of Ether held by these addresses. As displayed in the graph above, this value has increased to over 27 million ETH in January. This means that over 23% of Ether’s circulating supply switched addresses this month. While this could be due to the aforementioned institutional demand, it also highlights the predominance of short-term trading. Ultimately, this should be taken with caution as periods of intense short-term trading activity are often followed by sharp corrections as we observed with Chainlink last fall. Overall, the high exchange outflows and institutional volumes point to the growing demand for Ether. While this managed to push Ether to a new all-time high, traders should still be cautious as short-term activity reaches the highest levels since 2018.

Peanut is a price balancer that uses unique DeFi tools and services to maximize gains and reduce risks in the crypto space. It also helps with the prevention of DeFi bots. The protocol balances prices by dividing its assets into two parts, where 90% goes to a DEX, like Uniswap while the rest goes an intermediary that balances prices between DEXs and CEXs.

    "title": "CoinMarketCap\u0027s 2020 Round-Up: The Good, The Bad and The Bitcoin",
    "detailedContent": "Dear CoinMarketCap users, It’s finally 2021, and it’s almost like 2020 never existed — Bitcoin’s thrilling all-time highs that it seems to break every single day have almost wiped away the disaster that was 2020 (key word here: almost). Here at CoinMarketCap, we are as bullish on the new year as we could possibly be, and it’s due to a lot more than the price of the top crypto. In the past year, CoinMarketCap has gone through an acquisition by Binance, faked out Crypto Twitter with our pun-nily named Toilet Paper Token, rode the DeFi wave and now have coasted into 2021 with record-breaking price jumps from cryptocurrencies across our home page. 2020 was a year of soul-searching for a lot of the world — a global pandemic ground normal life to a halt, and many people began working from home and struggling with how to live in a world where travel stopped, restaurants became taboo and it was dangerous to hug your family. 2020 was also the year when cryptocurrencies became the biggest topic of the financial markets. From the wild gains and insanely creative projects in the decentralized finance space in the DeFi Summer, to Bitcoin’s aforementioned meteoric rise at the very close of 2020, CoinMarketCap has been watching just as much interest as you all. And we haven’t just been watching — CoinMarketCap has also been constantly thinking of new ways that your trusty crypto price aggregator can support all crypto seekers during our new reality. After the acquisition, CoinMarketCap was under huge pressure on social media. We sincerely thank those who care about CoinMarketCap for giving constructive criticism. We are not a perfect company, not even close. However, we have been thriving to provide unbiased, high quality and accurate crypto information to our users. This is why, despite the noise, our entire team was heads down on polishing our product in the past year as that is what we would like to be judged by. We (Truly) Put Users’ Needs First One of the biggest steps that we took (and if you saw our former ad revenue, you’d know how big it really is) was to remove all banner ads from the CoinMarketCap website. A dislike of banner ads is something that pretty much everyone can relate to — but at the same time, companies do need a little thing called money in order to stay afloat. However, at CoinMarketCap, we made the decision in 2020 to prioritize our user experience above all else. Removing banner ads removes a big distraction for our users, as well as speeds up the site — with no banner ads, you can see the price of Bitcoin that much faster. As part of CoinMarketCap’s plan to focus on improving our user experience, we also recently gave both our homepage and our coin details pages a fresh look. You no longer have to refresh our homepages to see prices — it refreshes for you, live. And at the top of the coin details page, all of the data that our users need is now available in a friendly view, and you can more easily add your favorite coins to your watchlist. To improve our user experience on the CoinMarketCap mobile app, we have also introduced live price auto-refresh as well as added new DeFi and storage categories. We know that the DeFi summer wave brought decentralized finance tokens to the top of everyone’s minds, while the launch of long-awaited decentralized storage projects like Filecoin brought a little sparkle to the not obviously exciting storage space. Beyond just new designs, CoinMarketCap also iterated on the site’s exchange rankings criteria as part of the goal of presenting the most accurate data possible. This spring, CoinMarketCap improved upon the liquidity metric, as well as included web traffic as a ranking factor, in order to maintain the high quality of data we are known for. We also introduced our confidence score for the market pairs of each cryptocurrency, which can help traders make informed decisions about where to buy crypto. Learn Crypto, Earn Crypto, Then Learn More Crypto One of CoinMarketCap’s guiding principles is our aim to showcase the cryptocurrency revolution — and 2020 was definitely a revolutionary year for crypto. What better way to show the world what’s been happening in crypto than to support crypto education? A revolution has to start somewhere, and informing the world about what cryptocurrency really is is one of the first steps. With this in mind, 2020 also brought you CoinMarketCap Earn, a way for those interested in crypto to earn money (in that crypto) while learning. Who doesn’t love free money? We know that you do! Sometimes adding a little incentive goes a long way. CoinMarketCap Earn saw over 120,000 visitors a week learn about top projects such as Band Protocol, Terra and The Graph. Take the financial incentive away, and CoinMarketCap brought our users another way to learn about crypto in 2020 — CMC Academy. Picture the library of Academy, which housed almost all of the books ever written during its time, then picture the library online, then picture those books replaced with articles about cryptocurrency — and you’ve got CMC Academy. From those just getting started in crypto, to more experienced crypto users wanting to dig into new projects, CMC Academy had you covered. Here are some of our favorite CMC Academy articles that 2020 brought us: - The Perennial Question: Should I Invest in Bitcoin or Altcoins? CMC’s research team dives into this age-old question. - A Dive Into Ethereum 2.0 A timely read since the ETH 2.0 December launch. - What Is Decentralized Finance?: A Deep Dive by The Defiant This needs no introduction! It’s just the first week of 2021 and Bitcoin has already broken $34,000 once — who knows what the rest of the year has in store? Happy new year, stay inside, wear a mask, and get ready for a year of ATHs!- CoinMarketCap",

    "title": "Deep Dive by Flipside Crypto: Exploring the World of Polygon DApps",
    "detailedContent": "There’s plenty of reasons to be excited about the Polygon ecosystem. That includes the improvements it offers over blockchains like Ethereum, including increased security and transparency. But it also includes the deep and wide array of DApps supported by Polygon. As we noted in our initial coverage of Polygon, its status as a multichain ecosystem helps to power several interesting and exciting applications. So, as we prepare for the arrival of Flipside data and bounties for Polygon it’s time to take a closer look at its DApps ecosystem. Infrastructure We’ll start our tour of the Polygon DApp landscape by looking at some of the applications that underpin other dApps on the platform — infrastructure DApps. These include oracles, such as the HAPI protocol, Gravity Protocol, Polytools and more, designed to help support a wide range of applications and use cases. It also includes several leading wallets that users can access and use on a wide range of other applications. That includes well-known wallets such as MetaMask, WalletConnect and more. Polygon DeFi DApps Now that you’ve got a wallet set up, dive into the wide array of DeFi DApps supported by Polygon. That includes a wide array of well-known applications, including Curve.Finance, SushiSwap, Aave and more. Many of these applications also work on other blockchains or networks. Perhaps more interesting, however, is the list of DeFi DApps that support new financial use cases and applications. SportX, for instance, provides a peer-to-peer app that allows users to place bets on soccer games, boxing matches, and other sporting events. Frax Finance, meanwhile, offers “the world’s first fractional-algorithmic stablecoin.\" You can see the entire list of Polygon DeFi DApps here. NFTs + Gaming If you’re looking for more fun than just betting, Polygon’s legion of NFT and Gaming DApps can provide some entertainment. That includes well-known crypto communities like OpenSea, one of the largest marketplaces for NFT and other collectibles, and Decentraland, a virtual game world run by its users. Major names in the gaming world are also getting on the Polygon DApp bandwagon. Video game pioneers including the likes of Atari are building games and DApps for the Polygon community. Polygon DAO DApps Want to get involved with the quickly growing world of DAOs? There’s a wide range of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations operating in the Polygon ecosystem. That includes open forums like Potato Media, decentralized file storage organizations like Otterpocket, and more. B2B The last stop on our tour of the Polygon dApp ecosystem is the network’s group of B2B apps. OPU Coin, for instance, is a decentralized platform that could improve the healthcare data economy. Ownest uses blockchain technology to restore trust in the supply chain, while projects like Equate and Parcel Money are designed to help improve skill assessment, hiring and HR processes.

    "detailedContent": "In the first week of 2021, we have been through a volatile performance in both market and politics. Bitcoin’s price fluctuated more than $4,000 in 24 hours after the attack on the U.S. Capitol horribly happened on Thursday. Ethereum surged above 70% after the new year, almost reaching its all-time-high. Meanwhile, since the beginning of 2021, some altcoins have attracted market favors (large-cap altcoins like XLM and Cardano’s ADA show “Blue Chips” properties), also rising sharply this week. However, the uncertainty remains as we look through data like funding rates and transactions fee. Ethereum’s funding rate stays at an extremely high level. Some analysts believe this high level can not remain in the long-term. Subscribe Join us in showcasing the cryptocurrency revolution, one newsletter at a time.

Bitcoin: From Peak to Summit Bitcoin’s wild price swings were crazy this week, jumping from $30,000 to $34,500 within 24 hours in the night on Jan. 2. The top coin then immediately fell below $30,000, triggering wildly panic among retail investors. BTC price in the last 7 days, chart from 9pm EST, Jan. 7.

OKEx’s data shows some retail investors’ sentiment in a very interesting way. According to OKEx’s trading data of the options market, on Jan 3., 65.1% of investors hold a negative attitude toward Bitcoin. OKEx’s options market trading info, chart from 9pm EST, Jan. 7. Source: gvol.io However, the price of Bitcoin did not go down. After Jan. 4, Bitcoin bounced back to $41,000 on Jan. 8, breaking the all-time-high again. Although it fluctuates around the $41K line, the price did not show signs of dropping down. The weekly trading volume of both the spot and derivative market of Bitcoin reached $71.6 billion and $577.3 billion respectively, increasing about 70% compared to the last week. The market turns retail investors\u0027 attitude immediately. On Jan 7., according to OKEx’s trading data of the options market, 61.7% of investors held a positive attitude.

On the one hand, the Chicago Futures Exchange (CME) will launch Ethereum futures in February, representing the traditional market’s recognition of another mainstream digital asset after Bitcoin. On the other hand, the deployment and implementation of Ethereum 2.0 are also in progress steadily. The search volume of Ethereum on the Internet has also reached the all-time-high. Support from both the market and technology pushed the price of Ethereum to a new high of $1,280, while the trading volume of spot and perpetual contracts has increased by more than 150%, and the trading volume of perpetual contracts has reached $169.4B, which is far beyond $100B. From the perspective of open interest, as of press time, the open interest of Ethereum has reached $2.6B, an increase of more than $1B compared to the beginning of the year. Even considering the price’s rising, the influence from the number of contracts can no longer be ignored. For Vitalik Buterin and everyone in the Ethereum community, this is a milestone moment.

Source: tokeninsight.com ETH perpetual open interest in the last 30 days, chart from 9pm EST, Jan. 7. Source: tokeninsight.com However, some analysts believe that this round of price increase is unsustainable for two reasons. First of all, although the market is wild and hot, the funding rate of perpetual contracts is about to reach the \"unbearable\" standard. BitMEX\u0027s Ethereum perpetual contract funding rate reached 0.6% on Jan. 5, and other exchanges’ funding rates of ETH perpetual contracts have also exceeded the highest level in history. For the derivatives market, such a high funding rate is unsustainable. Institutional investors may continue to carry out arbitrage of open interest by selling perpetual contracts to hold the spot, which will undoubtedly affect the price of the perpetual contract, and ultimately influence the spot price. ETH perpetual funding rates in the last 30 days, chart from 4:20am EST, Jan. 8. Source: tokeninsight.com On the other hand, from the perspective of the options market, the implied volatility of Ethereum at-the-money options has reached unprecedented heights (more than 150%, please refer to the previous TI weekly review for the introduction of implied volatility). However, compared with historical volatility, even implied volatility underestimates the degree of the ETH market’s volatility. When the historical volatility is higher than the implied volatility, it often indicates that the volatility of the spot market has exceeded investors\u0027 expectations, which means huge risks.

At least from the perspective of investors, their consensus on Ethereum has always been relatively optimistic. Whether spot, futures or options, this consensus has been reflected. Although market volatility is so huge, overall, the proportion of investors with a bullish attitude is always much higher than that of investors with a bearish attitude. What height will Ethereum reach? $1,600, or even more, $1,920? It is not known yet, and we are looking forward to the performance of Ethereum in the new year.

    "detailedContent": "So you’re in the jobs market? You’ve come to the right place. While many industries are struggling at the moment, it’s business as usual for go-getting blockchain firms looking to capitalize on the recent boom. Whether you’re a software engineer, smart contract developer, strategist or marketing whizz, there’s likely to be a vacancy that piques your interest. Take a look at the following job descriptions, then give your CV one last once-over. Your dream job could be a few clicks away. COO at TrustSwap | Remote DeFi platform TrustSwap enables safe, customizable transactions for the global crypto ecosystem. At the moment, it’s on the hunt for a no-nonsense chief operating officer (COO) to optimize its operational capabilities. Working with execs from the finance \u0026 operations, product, technology, HR, marketing and customer success teams, the incoming COO will be in a perfect position to influence the direction of the company. As well as being able to evaluate and monitor task performance across the business, the candidate will be tasked with identifying innovative ways to increase productivity. Would-be applicants should have at least five years’ management experience in a high-performance environment, with success in start-up firms and mergers and acquisitions. The position is remote, and TrustSwap pays in crypto. As part of its recruitment drive, TrustSwap is also hiring a technical project manager to oversee the work of developers scattered throughout the globe. In addition to being able to create and implement systems for scalable efficiency for the dev team, the candidate is expected to be an expert in Javascript, React, Solidity and Linux/ Unix Variants. Mobile development experience in React is also a big plus. Head of Marketing/Chief Marketing Officer at AnRKey X AnRKey X is a competitive gaming platform that is on a mission to merge eSports, NFTs and DeFi yield farming into an all-encompassing ecosystem for Web 3.0. If that sounds like something you can get on board with, and you’re an entrepreneurial marketing leader with 5-10 years of fintech/crypto experience, what are you waiting for? This is an excellent opportunity to be part of an exciting new project located at the intersection of various crypto sub-sectors. The head of marketing will lead all marketing endeavors and advance the firm’s strategic growth plan via first-rate content and meticulous ROI analysis. Make no mistake, this is a hands-on role in an industry that moves at warp speed — but the rewards make it worthwhile. Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at RealT | Remote RealT is a fast-growing startup that offers fractional and frictionless real estate investment opportunities, powered by blockchain. Ownership of U.S.-based properties is denominated by ERC20 tokens, with rental payments paid automatically to Ethereum wallets. Currently, the company is in the market for a chief technology officer passionate about blockchain, DeFi and real estate. The CTO will be accountable for the delivery, quality, availability and performance of RealT’s technology platform, websites, services, databases, wallet and cloud infrastructure. As such, it is a role that will appeal to those with both a wealth of experience and an ability to take big, sometimes risky decisions. Because of the technical requirements of the post, knowledge of Ethereum and EVM-based blockchains is also required, so well as proficiency in JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Angular, Node.js and MySQL. If you’re up to the challenge, this is a terrific opportunity to participate in taking tokenized real estate to the next level. JavaScript Engineer at MetaMask | Remote MetaMask acts as a gateway to the cryptocurrency/DeFi market for well over a million monthly users. Available as a browser extension and mobile app, the Ethereum wallet and token exchange is notable for its user-friendly design and strong security. At the moment, MetaMask is hiring engineers (mid, senior, lead) to champion full-stack feature development, secure and robust code and exceptional user experiences across its JavaScript codebase. Specifically, it is seeking to recruit people based in timezones between UTC-8:00 and UTC-0:00 (North and South America, Western Europe and Western Africa). The new recruits will be tasked with leading feature development for the MetaMask browser extension, contributing to team discussions about UX design and technical issues, and triaging GitHub issues. Ideally, you’ll have used MetaMask before — and have ideas about possible improvements. Full Stack Engineer at Pocket Network | Remote Pocket Network is a decentralized API protocol and marketplace whose mainnet launched in mid-2020. In essence, the distributed network enables developers to constantly keep their DApp running with confidence, without having to depend on a single-service network provider. The software startup is currently looking to hire a full-stack Javascript engineer to architect, design and implement mission-critical products that help app developers leverage Pocket. The new recruit will determine the technical direction for the Pocket Dashboard and Gateway web products, and produce relevant documentation while triaging tech issues. If you have full-stack development experience, get your application in stat. Director of Community at Unstoppable Domains | Remote Unstoppable Domains is an ambitious San Francisco-based startup with offices in Kiev. The premise is simple: users get to buy blockchain domains and store them in their crypto wallet alongside their Bitcoin and ETH.

    "detailedContent": "Every week, IntoTheBlock brings you on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. NFTs Reach New Highs With OpenSea Burning Millions Worth of ETH By now you have probably heard about non-fungible tokens (NFTs). NFTs are often associated with digital art, but they are much more than that. This article covers the impressive resurgence of the NFT market, their possible future usability and how it is likely to continue to affect Ethereum’s ecosystem following the London hard fork. After much anticipation, Ethereum’s London hard fork upgrade took place on Aug. 5. Along with it five different improvement proposals were implemented, EIP-1559 being the most awaited. This has the potential to fundamentally transform the way ETH is valued. While many claimed NFTs were “dead” following their breakout in the first quarter of 2021, recent on-chain action proves they are alive and better than ever. As we’ll get into, NFT prices have rocketed past previous highs and their share of the total amount of blockchain activity has increased significantly marking as well important milestones for NFT platform aggregator OpenSea. The significance of NFTs on Ethereum is evident on gas costs, recording significant gas price rises in correlation with major NFT drops. As of Aug.16, 2021 through ITB\u0027s network insights The NFT space has quickly become dominated by drops, where a collection of verifiably-scarce digital pieces are tokenized and sold on the blockchain. These drops can range from acclaimed artists’ artwork to machine-generated patterns to, of course, cats and penguins. Most recently, we’ve seen several drops take over Ethereum gas fees. CyberKongz VX, which consists of monkey theme art works, last Sunday led average hourly gas prices all the way up to 414 Gwei, burning more than 1,200 Eth in 5 hours. This brought the project all the way to first place on the leaderboard in terms of addresses with more burned fees. A major player benefiting from the increased appetite for NFTs has been OpenSea. The NFT marketplace aggregator, which recently raised a $100 million series B valuing the project at 1.5 billion, broke all-time high volumes in July and consecutively is already at its highest monthly volume half way into August, more than tripling the total volume reached for the entire month of July. This indicator clearly depicts the large extent of the market rise the NFT space has experienced. From July 2020 to the end of July 2021, the protocol has managed to increase its volume by an astonishing 30,000%. The growth of the protocol is also clear on the Ethereum ecosystem, being one of the main burners since the implementation. Alex Atallah, Co-founder and CTO of OpenSea manifested the company\u0027s success through his twitter account, letting the community know that the protocol passed for the first time $1 billion in volume for the month of August overcoming respected e-commerce company Etsy. Source: Twitter Atallah also hinted at one of the protocol’s goals: to surpass eBay on sales volume. EBay’s volume aggregate for Q2 2021 totaled $22.11 billion in comparison to OpenSea ,which processed approximately $382 million. Despite the fact that it still looks like a shy number in comparison with giant e-commerce eBay, it\u0027s important to keep into account that OpenSea numbers have shown impressive growth during the months of July and August, surpassing the aggregate of all previous months. In this same aspect, eBay’s platform currently offers a wide variety of products with broad usability features, and it\u0027s impressive that the nascent NFT’s industry has already reached such impressive numbers with limited usability products. This developing industry is projected to offer a diverse range of digital products and services, indirectly competing with physical ones offered by eBay or Amazon. The increased speculation in NFTs has on multiple occasions led to prohibitively high fees for Ethereum users. This is likely to still be the case, as EIP-1559 was not meant to decrease fees (this was a somewhat common misconception). While users will still have to wait for broader layer 2 adoption for lower fees, at least now holders are aligned with demand for network usage. This is the case as the majority of fees paid in transactions are now burned, effectively reducing the net amount of ETH inflation by simply buying NFTs. Currently 1.7 million ETH are speculated to be burned this year with the integration of EIP-1559, bringing the net inflation down to 3.1%. As of Aug. 16, 2021 using ITB\u0027s Ethereum network indicators As previously mentioned, the increase in gas fees on Ethereum was closely related to NFTs in general. The Indicator shows the total amount paid in fees to use the blockchain on a given day. During the last month it recorded an increase of nearly 140%, with a high of 7.65k ETH on Aug. 10 when VOX NFTs dropped. A clear correlation is also visible between the dates of expected NFTs releases, visible on the first indicator of this article, and the aggregate total fees. Through ultrasound.money\u0027s burn leaderboard, we can see that two of the four highest burning addresses are related to NFTs — which again shows clear evidence of the importance of NFTs in the Ethereum network. Ultrasound.money source The NFT market is proving doubters and naysayers wrong. While there are still many people that might not fully understand them, NFTs have brought to prominence the rise of digital art, collectibles and enable novel business models such as Axie\u0027s play-to-earn or Stoner Cats TV pass. NFTs have a high potential to create demand for more people to enter the crypto space through these diverse use-cases. The developing industry gives prominent conditions for antique traditional industries to evolve in the space. Following EIP-1559, supply-side economics also favor Ethereum holders as ETH is burnt every time an NFT is bought. Ultimately, this reinforces Ether\u0027s monetary \"soundness\" and is a major step as Ethereum continues to grow.

Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. On-Chain Analysis of China’s Crypto Crackdown Crypto markets have experienced a highly volatile month, even by crypto’s standards. Following last week’s FUD from Elon Musk, the past seven days have been filled with panic from retail traders, arising mostly from China taking measures in crypto. Despite the despair from traders seeing crypto prices crash, the reality is most of this \"news\" from China was simply reiterations of China’s stance since 2017, as covered by The Block. The only new measures discussed come from inner Mongolia making a proposal to restrict mining and mitigate energy consumption in the Chinese autonomous region. A mix of these news and some rumors ignited a crash across crypto markets, taking as much as $1 trillion from the total crypto market cap. While most crypto-assets dropped over 30% within a week, they remain for the most part with double- or triple-digit returns year-to-date. The regulatory uncertainty in China has certainly taken a hit on crypto. However, this may not seem as negative as it seems at first glance. For one, the high allocation of hash rate in China has been seen by many as a centralization risk for Bitcoin over the past few years. As well, the use of coal power plants to mine Bitcoin has been criticized, notably with Tesla no longer accepting Bitcoin payments due to their alleged environmental impact. The recent measures from the Chinese government, though they may cause headwinds short-term, would potentially reduce both of these issues. In other words, Bitcoin mining could end up being more decentralized and environmentally friendly as a result of this so-called \"crack-down.\" Another point of concern that has been mentioned recently is that existing miners may be looking to sell as a result of these measures. The reality is, though, that while some miners do have decently-sized Bitcoin holdings, the amount they accrue on a daily basis is negligible relative to the total amount of Bitcoin traded. The graph above displays the percentage that daily mining rewards represent out of the total on-chain volume. As evidenced from this graph, the volume share pertaining to miners has constantly declined, sitting currently around 0.03% out of the total Bitcoin blockchain volume. While miners that have held Bitcoin for years may still be able to impact Bitcoin’s price, the data shows that the marginal effect that they can have by selling has decreased significantly. As the share of volume attributed to miners decreased, the amount trading in centralized exchanges continues to grow. For this reason, a full crackdown on Chinese centralized exchanges is likely to have a higher impact than banning mining. This trend may have started as OKEx and Huobi began limiting service to Chinese users, citing “recent dynamic changes in the market.” These measures directly impacted on-chain activity with Bitcoin outflows from these exchanges hitting new yearly highs. As of May 26 via IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin exchange flows The increase in outflows from OKEx and Huobi point to users withdrawing significant amounts of Bitcoin. This could be the result of people anticipating stronger measures from the Chinese government, and may lead to some short-term panic. The past couple of weeks have served to show that China may be taking serious measures in the crypto space. While many of these have simply been reiterations of previous statements, there does seem to be some action as shown with the proposal to restrict mining in inner Mongolia or the measures taken by centralized exchanges. Even though this has created near-term uncertainty, these may end up being beneficial long-term for Bitcoin and crypto in general. A Chinese crackdown on mining results in broader, more decentralized dispersion of hash rate, while also removing some of the players that consume the most coal in the process. Despite this, the spotlight remains on both Chinese miners and exchanges, but more so with the latter. Ultimately, though the markets have settled down so far, they await clarity before heading higher.

    "title": "CoinMarketCap Launches a New, Enhanced Price Estimate Feature",
    "detailedContent": "Back in May, we launched our price estimate feature that allows all of our users to guess the price of their favorite coins. Lots of our users participated in the estimates and contributed to the price prediction model we designed. After a few months of data collection, we are launching a new price estimate dashboard along with the leaderboard and personal estimate page! What Is the Price Estimate Dashboard? We’ve collected the data submitted from our users since May in order to calculate some key statistics for you to browse. On this new page, we display the top six popular coins that most of our users make predictions for, and the stats for these hot coins. We also list those coins our users made the best estimations for in the past month — the ranking is based on how accurately users estimated. From here, users can go to individual coins or tokens to view the estimation details or make new estimates. We hope that you can find some interesting inspiration for your next investment move! What Is the Leaderboard? Among all the users making predictions, we calculate an estimation score for each user and rank them in the leaderboard. This estimation score is calculated based on a user’s closest estimates, average estimate accuracy as well as the coverage of estimates for the past six months. The more coins you predict — and the better you predict — could get you at a higher position on the leaderboard! If you are interested in seeing other users\u0027 predictions, simply click on the username and check the stats! Please note this leaderboard updates once a month. Check where you are right now and don’t lose any time to try to rank higher in the next month! What Is the Personal Estimate Page? You might have placed lots of estimates from time to time, and it’s hard to keep track of all the estimates made before. Don’t worry, we consolidated your estimates and key statistics on one page for you! On this page, users can view their own estimated statistics and the accuracy chart calculated from the past six months of data. Users are also able to view a list of coins and tokens that they have placed the estimates for a specific month. Potential Future Developments Soon, we’ll be introducing the daily task and leaderboard award for you to collect more CoinMarketCap Diamonds!",

    "title": "What Is the Best Time to Transact on Ethereum?: Flipside Crypto",
    "detailedContent": "We\u0027ve got some time before Ethereum fees get cheaper. Transaction fees on the Ethereum network have been increasing rapidly since late July 2020, when “the Summer DeFi Boom” visibly started. But the network congestion caused by increasing demand in DeFi did not end with the summer — it has only gotten worse. On Jan. 4 of this year, Ethereum fees reached an average of $17.44 per transaction. And while Ethereum has started tackling the issue — the transition to a faster proof-of-stake mining algorithm could take years to complete. In the meantime, it’s best to avoid 2-6PM UTC. We broke down daily Ethereum fees by the hour, to highlight the best times to transact per region. The box plot above shows average fees per day in 2020 for every hour. The bars are where most of the data falls. The black dots are outliers. The data clearly shows fees are at their highest between 2-6pm UTC. The best times to transact are instead between 1AM-3AM, 5AM-8AM, and 9PM to 11PM UTC. Who Is Causing These Spikes in Fees? 💸 Whales or Smaller Wallets? By looking at the transactions happening on Ethereum, we were able to find that Ethereum whales were transacting far more than smaller wallets. We defined whales as wallets that held over 20 ETH (~ USD 26,600 at the time of writing) throughout 2020. These larger wallets’ transaction activity coincided throughout with fee surges (first graph above). 🌍 Where Are They Located? We also checked to see if accounts in Asia were more active than in North America, and we found that both regions have about the same amount of activity.

    "title": "All You Need To Know About Aave: Flipside Crypto",
    "detailedContent": "Aave bounties, a scavenger hunt and more are coming to Flipside Crypto. But before we’re visited by this friendly ghost, it’s time to check in on the latest news for the decentralized lending protocol. Last time we talked Aave, we took a closer look at the basics of the protocol and its quickly increasing TVL. So what’s the latest for the protocol? It includes expansion to new protocols and offerings, as well as an all-time high in price. Let’s take a closer look. Aave Explores Expansion We’ll start with a look at the recent talk of expansion for Aave onto Layer 2 networks, as well as Solana. According to reports, Aave founder and CEO Stani Kulechov confirmed recently that the company was investigating a multichain strategy. That strategy would not only include Layer 2 protocols such as Avalanche, Arbitrum and Optimism, but also Solana. The reports were met with a generally positive response, especially from Solana and its devotees. ETH Twitter on the Way? Layer 2 expansion isn’t the only new offering in the works for Aave. According to reports, Kulechov is also said to be “on a mission” to develop an alternative to Twitter using the Ethereum blockchain. Known as “ETHlend,” the idea first gained attention in 2017 as a non-custodial, decentralized lending protocol. Now, Kulechov says, the idea has shifted. In this new offering, users would be able to earn money by interacting on a social media site that would follow in the vein of microblogging site Twitter. An ATH for AAVE Perhaps most exciting for those in the ecosystem was the increase in demand that took place earlier this month, leading to an all-time high price for AAVE, the platform’s native token. As Cointelegraph noted, traders seemed to take word of AAVE’s in Bitwise Investment’s new investment vehicle as auspicious news. As a result, AAVE’s price surged by nearly 10% to reach $333.84 on Aug. 6 and continued its upside momentum into the following days. TVL, or total value locked, was already at high levels in the months leading up to this spike, as we profiled earlier this year. In recent weeks, however, TVL also surged to record levels.

    "title": "Ethereum ATH Propelled by Exchange Outflows \u0026 Institutional Activity: A Data Perspective by IntoTheBlock",
    "detailedContent": "Every week, IntoTheBlock brings you on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. This week, we analyze leading indicators that have been pushing Ethereum to new highs even as Bitcoin retraces. Through an on-chain lens, we are able to identify some of the factors that may be behind Ether’s performance. Ethereum Exchange Outflows Reach Record Levels Due to the blockchain’s transparency, crypto analytics platforms such as IntoTheBlock are able to monitor funds flowing in and out of exchanges. Given the relevance of exchanges in crypto, these flows can be very relevant to identify market trends. In the past week, Ether’s exchange outflows relative to its inflows reached its highest level to date. Net Flows — which subtract exchange deposits (inflows) minus withdrawals (outflows) — surpassed $1 billion on Jan. 22; that is $1 billion more Ether was withdrawn than deposited into centralized exchanges. As of Jan. 26, 2021 through IntoTheBlock’s Ethereum exchange flows Generally, large exchange outflows suggest investors opting to move their funds out of centralized venues into (self) custody or other applications. This could be interpreted as a bullish signal, as funds outside centralized exchanges are typically harder or more expensive to sell. Moreover, the withdrawal of these funds mean that there is now $1 billion less Ether available to be sold in centralized exchanges. The continuous withdrawal of Ether taking place could even lead to what is known as a sell-side liquidity crisis, where the lack of funds available to be sold ends up causing prices to spike. That could very well have had something to do with Ether’s recent all-time high as its mid-price grew nearly 20% following the sizable outflows. Ether Institutional Demand Leading the Way As recently covered in Coinbase’s 2020 Review, institutional investing in Ether is picking up. Blockchain data supports this claim. At IntoTheBlock we closely follow Large Transactions Volume — the aggregate volume spent in transfers of over $100,000 in value — as a proxy to institutional activity. This value has been increasing throughout 2020 and at an even faster rate in 2021. As of Jan. 26, 2021 through IntoTheBlock’s Ethereum financial indicators Large transaction volume in 2021 has surpassed $10 billion per day on multiple occasions. On Jan. 22, the day with over $1 billion in net outflows, $10.7 billion in large transactions was recorded on the Ethereum blockchain, pointing to institutional demand driving Ether’s price. Short-Term Trading Also at Yearly Highs Given the high amount of interest picking up for Ethereum, a significant portion of its total volume and holders has changed hands over the past month. IntoTheBlock classifies as traders those addresses that have held a crypto-asset for under 30 days. The number of traders for Ether reached a multi-year high. As of Jan. 26, 2021 through IntoTheBlock’s Ethereum financial indicators More remarkable, though, is the total volume of Ether held by these addresses. As displayed in the graph above, this value has increased to over 27 million ETH in January. This means that over 23% of Ether’s circulating supply switched addresses this month. While this could be due to the aforementioned institutional demand, it also highlights the predominance of short-term trading. Ultimately, this should be taken with caution as periods of intense short-term trading activity are often followed by sharp corrections as we observed with Chainlink last fall. Overall, the high exchange outflows and institutional volumes point to the growing demand for Ether. While this managed to push Ether to a new all-time high, traders should still be cautious as short-term activity reaches the highest levels since 2018.

Peanut is a price balancer that uses unique DeFi tools and services to maximize gains and reduce risks in the crypto space. It also helps with the prevention of DeFi bots. The protocol balances prices by dividing its assets into two parts, where 90% goes to a DEX, like Uniswap while the rest goes an intermediary that balances prices between DEXs and CEXs.

    "title": "CoinMarketCap\u0027s 2020 Round-Up: The Good, The Bad and The Bitcoin",
    "detailedContent": "Dear CoinMarketCap users, It’s finally 2021, and it’s almost like 2020 never existed — Bitcoin’s thrilling all-time highs that it seems to break every single day have almost wiped away the disaster that was 2020 (key word here: almost). Here at CoinMarketCap, we are as bullish on the new year as we could possibly be, and it’s due to a lot more than the price of the top crypto. In the past year, CoinMarketCap has gone through an acquisition by Binance, faked out Crypto Twitter with our pun-nily named Toilet Paper Token, rode the DeFi wave and now have coasted into 2021 with record-breaking price jumps from cryptocurrencies across our home page. 2020 was a year of soul-searching for a lot of the world — a global pandemic ground normal life to a halt, and many people began working from home and struggling with how to live in a world where travel stopped, restaurants became taboo and it was dangerous to hug your family. 2020 was also the year when cryptocurrencies became the biggest topic of the financial markets. From the wild gains and insanely creative projects in the decentralized finance space in the DeFi Summer, to Bitcoin’s aforementioned meteoric rise at the very close of 2020, CoinMarketCap has been watching just as much interest as you all. And we haven’t just been watching — CoinMarketCap has also been constantly thinking of new ways that your trusty crypto price aggregator can support all crypto seekers during our new reality. After the acquisition, CoinMarketCap was under huge pressure on social media. We sincerely thank those who care about CoinMarketCap for giving constructive criticism. We are not a perfect company, not even close. However, we have been thriving to provide unbiased, high quality and accurate crypto information to our users. This is why, despite the noise, our entire team was heads down on polishing our product in the past year as that is what we would like to be judged by. We (Truly) Put Users’ Needs First One of the biggest steps that we took (and if you saw our former ad revenue, you’d know how big it really is) was to remove all banner ads from the CoinMarketCap website. A dislike of banner ads is something that pretty much everyone can relate to — but at the same time, companies do need a little thing called money in order to stay afloat. However, at CoinMarketCap, we made the decision in 2020 to prioritize our user experience above all else. Removing banner ads removes a big distraction for our users, as well as speeds up the site — with no banner ads, you can see the price of Bitcoin that much faster. As part of CoinMarketCap’s plan to focus on improving our user experience, we also recently gave both our homepage and our coin details pages a fresh look. You no longer have to refresh our homepages to see prices — it refreshes for you, live. And at the top of the coin details page, all of the data that our users need is now available in a friendly view, and you can more easily add your favorite coins to your watchlist. To improve our user experience on the CoinMarketCap mobile app, we have also introduced live price auto-refresh as well as added new DeFi and storage categories. We know that the DeFi summer wave brought decentralized finance tokens to the top of everyone’s minds, while the launch of long-awaited decentralized storage projects like Filecoin brought a little sparkle to the not obviously exciting storage space. Beyond just new designs, CoinMarketCap also iterated on the site’s exchange rankings criteria as part of the goal of presenting the most accurate data possible. This spring, CoinMarketCap improved upon the liquidity metric, as well as included web traffic as a ranking factor, in order to maintain the high quality of data we are known for. We also introduced our confidence score for the market pairs of each cryptocurrency, which can help traders make informed decisions about where to buy crypto. Learn Crypto, Earn Crypto, Then Learn More Crypto One of CoinMarketCap’s guiding principles is our aim to showcase the cryptocurrency revolution — and 2020 was definitely a revolutionary year for crypto. What better way to show the world what’s been happening in crypto than to support crypto education? A revolution has to start somewhere, and informing the world about what cryptocurrency really is is one of the first steps. With this in mind, 2020 also brought you CoinMarketCap Earn, a way for those interested in crypto to earn money (in that crypto) while learning. Who doesn’t love free money? We know that you do! Sometimes adding a little incentive goes a long way. CoinMarketCap Earn saw over 120,000 visitors a week learn about top projects such as Band Protocol, Terra and The Graph. Take the financial incentive away, and CoinMarketCap brought our users another way to learn about crypto in 2020 — CMC Academy. Picture the library of Academy, which housed almost all of the books ever written during its time, then picture the library online, then picture those books replaced with articles about cryptocurrency — and you’ve got CMC Academy. From those just getting started in crypto, to more experienced crypto users wanting to dig into new projects, CMC Academy had you covered. Here are some of our favorite CMC Academy articles that 2020 brought us: - The Perennial Question: Should I Invest in Bitcoin or Altcoins? CMC’s research team dives into this age-old question. - A Dive Into Ethereum 2.0 A timely read since the ETH 2.0 December launch. - What Is Decentralized Finance?: A Deep Dive by The Defiant This needs no introduction! It’s just the first week of 2021 and Bitcoin has already broken $34,000 once — who knows what the rest of the year has in store? Happy new year, stay inside, wear a mask, and get ready for a year of ATHs!- CoinMarketCap",

As we noted in our initial coverage of Polygon, its status as a multichain ecosystem helps to power several interesting and exciting applications. So, as we prepare for the arrival of Flipside data and bounties for Polygon it’s time to take a closer look at its DApps ecosystem. Infrastructure We’ll start our tour of the Polygon DApp landscape by looking at some of the applications that underpin other dApps on the platform — infrastructure DApps. These include oracles, such as the HAPI protocol, Gravity Protocol, Polytools and more, designed to help support a wide range of applications and use cases. It also includes several leading wallets that users can access and use on a wide range of other applications. That includes well-known wallets such as MetaMask, WalletConnect and more. Polygon DeFi DApps Now that you’ve got a wallet set up, dive into the wide array of DeFi DApps supported by Polygon. That includes a wide array of well-known applications, including Curve.Finance, SushiSwap, Aave and more. Many of these applications also work on other blockchains or networks. Perhaps more interesting, however, is the list of DeFi DApps that support new financial use cases and applications. SportX, for instance, provides a peer-to-peer app that allows users to place bets on soccer games, boxing matches, and other sporting events. Frax Finance, meanwhile, offers “the world’s first fractional-algorithmic stablecoin.\" You can see the entire list of Polygon DeFi DApps here. NFTs + Gaming If you’re looking for more fun than just betting, Polygon’s legion of NFT and Gaming DApps can provide some entertainment. That includes well-known crypto communities like OpenSea, one of the largest marketplaces for NFT and other collectibles, and Decentraland, a virtual game world run by its users. Major names in the gaming world are also getting on the Polygon DApp bandwagon. Video game pioneers including the likes of Atari are building games and DApps for the Polygon community. Polygon DAO DApps Want to get involved with the quickly growing world of DAOs? There’s a wide range of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations operating in the Polygon ecosystem. That includes open forums like Potato Media, decentralized file storage organizations like Otterpocket, and more. B2B The last stop on our tour of the Polygon dApp ecosystem is the network’s group of B2B apps. OPU Coin, for instance, is a decentralized platform that could improve the healthcare data economy. Ownest uses blockchain technology to restore trust in the supply chain, while projects like Equate and Parcel Money are designed to help improve skill assessment, hiring and HR processes.

    "detailedContent": "In the first week of 2021, we have been through a volatile performance in both market and politics. Bitcoin’s price fluctuated more than $4,000 in 24 hours after the attack on the U.S. Capitol horribly happened on Thursday. Ethereum surged above 70% after the new year, almost reaching its all-time-high. Meanwhile, since the beginning of 2021, some altcoins have attracted market favors (large-cap altcoins like XLM and Cardano’s ADA show “Blue Chips” properties), also rising sharply this week. However, the uncertainty remains as we look through data like funding rates and transactions fee. Ethereum’s funding rate stays at an extremely high level. Some analysts believe this high level can not remain in the long-term. Subscribe Join us in showcasing the cryptocurrency revolution, one newsletter at a time.

Bitcoin: From Peak to Summit Bitcoin’s wild price swings were crazy this week, jumping from $30,000 to $34,500 within 24 hours in the night on Jan. 2. The top coin then immediately fell below $30,000, triggering wildly panic among retail investors. BTC price in the last 7 days, chart from 9pm EST, Jan. 7. Source: tokeninsight.com As a market sentiment indicator, the options market reflects different groups of investors’ sentiment information. OKEx’s data shows some retail investors’ sentiment in a very interesting way. According to OKEx’s trading data of the options market, on Jan 3., 65.1% of investors hold a negative attitude toward Bitcoin. OKEx’s options market trading info, chart from 9pm EST, Jan. 7. Source: gvol.io However, the price of Bitcoin did not go down. After Jan. 4, Bitcoin bounced back to $41,000 on Jan. 8, breaking the all-time-high again. Although it fluctuates around the $41K line, the price did not show signs of dropping down. The weekly trading volume of both the spot and derivative market of Bitcoin reached $71.6 billion and $577.3 billion respectively, increasing about 70% compared to the last week. The market turns retail investors\u0027 attitude immediately. On Jan 7., according to OKEx’s trading data of the options market, 61.7% of investors held a positive attitude.

Source: tokeninsight.com Will 2021 Belong to Ethereum? For Ethereum, the beginning of 2021 is undoubtedly wonderful. On the one hand, the Chicago Futures Exchange (CME) will launch Ethereum futures in February, representing the traditional market’s recognition of another mainstream digital asset after Bitcoin. On the other hand, the deployment and implementation of Ethereum 2.0 are also in progress steadily. The search volume of Ethereum on the Internet has also reached the all-time-high. Support from both the market and technology pushed the price of Ethereum to a new high of $1,280, while the trading volume of spot and perpetual contracts has increased by more than 150%, and the trading volume of perpetual contracts has reached $169.4B, which is far beyond $100B. From the perspective of open interest, as of press time, the open interest of Ethereum has reached $2.6B, an increase of more than $1B compared to the beginning of the year. Even considering the price’s rising, the influence from the number of contracts can no longer be ignored. For Vitalik Buterin and everyone in the Ethereum community, this is a milestone moment.

Source: tokeninsight.com ETH perpetual open interest in the last 30 days, chart from 9pm EST, Jan. 7. Source: tokeninsight.com However, some analysts believe that this round of price increase is unsustainable for two reasons. First of all, although the market is wild and hot, the funding rate of perpetual contracts is about to reach the \"unbearable\" standard. BitMEX\u0027s Ethereum perpetual contract funding rate reached 0.6% on Jan. 5, and other exchanges’ funding rates of ETH perpetual contracts have also exceeded the highest level in history. For the derivatives market, such a high funding rate is unsustainable. Institutional investors may continue to carry out arbitrage of open interest by selling perpetual contracts to hold the spot, which will undoubtedly affect the price of the perpetual contract, and ultimately influence the spot price. ETH perpetual funding rates in the last 30 days, chart from 4:20am EST, Jan. 8. Source: tokeninsight.com On the other hand, from the perspective of the options market, the implied volatility of Ethereum at-the-money options has reached unprecedented heights (more than 150%, please refer to the previous TI weekly review for the introduction of implied volatility). However, compared with historical volatility, even implied volatility underestimates the degree of the ETH market’s volatility. When the historical volatility is higher than the implied volatility, it often indicates that the volatility of the spot market has exceeded investors\u0027 expectations, which means huge risks.

Source: gvol.io Comparison of ETH options’ historical volatility and implied volatility in the last 30 days, chart from 1:00am EST, Jan. 8. Source: gvol.io Will 2021 be the year of Ethereum? At least from the perspective of investors, their consensus on Ethereum has always been relatively optimistic. Whether spot, futures or options, this consensus has been reflected. Although market volatility is so huge, overall, the proportion of investors with a bullish attitude is always much higher than that of investors with a bearish attitude. What height will Ethereum reach? $1,600, or even more, $1,920? It is not known yet, and we are looking forward to the performance of Ethereum in the new year.

This is an excellent opportunity to be part of an exciting new project located at the intersection of various crypto sub-sectors.

Ethereum Fees Hit ATHs Amid Uncanny Dog-Token Frenzy Ethereum has become notorious for its high fees during this bull market. For better or worse, Ethereum users have dealt with fees as high as $100 for simple ERC-20 token transactions. While these transaction fees typically price out retail users, there currently has been an outrageous amount of speculation surrounding dog-themed tokens on Ethereum. Following DOGE-mania, Shiba Inu (SHIB) and similar tokens have attempted to steal the meme token’s spotlight, with one even being named Doge Killer (LEASH). These tokens — as ridiculous as they sound — have been seeing transaction volumes in the hundreds of millions of dollars as their prices defy gravity. As of May 11, 2021 via CoinMarketCap The parabolic returns have enticed retail users with many willing to spend triple digits in Ethereum gas fees to gamble on potentially higher profits. As a result, five out of the top ten trading pairs over the past 24 hours pertain to dog-related tokens, including DogeIon Mars (ELON)... As of May 11, 2021 through IntoTheBlock’s DEX Insights ‍The high amount in trading fees for these pairs has resulted in the projected return on liquidity (ROL) for liquidity providers to currently be as high as 1,900% yearly. It is important to note, though, that these returns are likely to drop as either a) volumes (and therefore fees) drop or b) more liquidity providers enter the market diminishing the returns obtained on average. A mix of both of these is also likely. The current dog-coin speculation — along with existing demand for decentralized applications — has led to record high fees on Ethereum. Over $89 million was spent on Ethereum fees on May 10. As of May 11, 2021 through IntoTheBlock’s DeFi Network Insights Moreover, within a single hour Ethereum managed to accrue more fees ($5.78 million) than Bitcoin throughout the whole day ($5.71 million). Uniswap V2 was responsible for a high amount of the Ethereum fees with $6.85 million on May 10. More often than not, these high fees are discussed as prohibitive for retail users given that day-to-day users may not be able to afford them. The current dog-token rally may prove to be the exception to the rule, likely due to traders projecting previous returns into the future. While fees certainly need to decrease in order for broader mainstream adoption to take place, they also showcase the vast demand to use blockchain-based applications. This is the case as fees illustrate the willingness to pay for blockspace; given that the amount of transactions that fit within a block is limited, fees dynamically adjust based on demand. Additionally, in the case of Ethereum, upgrades such as EIP 1559 seek to capitalize on high fees as part of transaction fees (referred to as the basefee) will result in ETH supply being burned. This is likely to lead to ETH’s supply becoming deflationary as usage and payments adoption on Ethereum grows. Overall, the uncanny dog-token rally has reopened the debate of high fees being positive or negative for a blockchain. While it is certain that users are getting left out due to the high fees, the impressive demand to use blockchain applications does suggest higher adoption down the road, especially as scalability solutions become implemented.

    "title": "Crypto Consolidates as New Interest Cools Down, but Potential Catalysts Emerge : A Data Perspective by IntoTheBlock",
    "detailedContent": "Powered by Every week, IntoTheBlock brings you on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. Crypto markets have been trading sideways or slightly down for the most part throughout June. As the price of Bitcoin consolidates around the low $30,000s, blockchain activity is cooling off, but institutional interest prevails with several large players entering or doubling down on crypto. As of July 1, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Capital Markets Insights In terms of price, Bitcoin closed the month down nearly 5% at $35,000; a relatively stable month by crypto standards. On the other hand, Ethereum took a bigger hit, dropping 17%, but still managing to close above the $2,000 threshold. As prices settle down, newcomers are starting to fade. The number of Bitcoin active addresses and new ones being created has fallen steeply, closely following price activity. As of July 1, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin Network Indicators This pattern has played out time and again, with retail investors often being attracted to enter after months of upwards price action. At a price of $35,000, these addresses that bought near the top consist of approximately 30% of all holders, as indicated by IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin in/out of the money metric. Although retail activity is slowing down, large players appear to be setting up moves in the crypto market. Amongst these is a16z, which announced its third crypto fund, raising $2.2 billion — the highest so far for any crypto-focused venture capital fund. Traditional hedge funds not yet in crypto are also eyeing moves into the space. Most notably, Point72, a $22 billion hedge fund is hiring a Head of Crypto. Billionaire George Soros’ family office also started trading Bitcoin recently. As funds like these get started, a new wave of institutional money is likely to continue pushing crypto forward, much like how it happened in late 2020. Large transactions volume, which tracks the aggregate amount transferred in transactions of over $100,000, acts as a proxy to monitor flows from institutional players and whales. This metric has also appeared to cool off, but still remains much higher than it was a year ago. As of July 1, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin Financial Indicators While institutional activity on a daily basis seems to have settled down, it is worth noting that large players like these often invest with a multi-year time horizon. Therefore, it is normal for large transaction volume to drop-short term, and this does not mean institutions have left or sold their crypto. As these hedge funds look into crypto, there is a race towards offering them the most convenient way to invest in Bitcoin: an ETF. Most recently Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest joined the list of dozens (hundreds?) of firms to file for a Bitcoin ETF. With applications for a Bitcoin ETF tracing as far back as 2013, it is fair to say that there is plenty of anticipation for a product like this to come to market. Making investing in Bitcoin as convenient as in any other asset is likely to be a massive catalyst for hedge funds and other traditional investors. Overall, there is this contrast between retail interest fading away and institutional players looking to get in. As this demand adds up and prices consolidate, it is likely that crypto markets are taking a break prior to continuing the bull market.

    "title": "Bitcoin’s Crash Aftermath \u0026 Next Moves: A Data Perspective by IntoTheBlock",
    "detailedContent": "Every week, IntoTheBlock brings you on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. This week, we analyze Bitcoin’s crash from a data perspective. Specifically, we take a look at the indicators of excessive speculation in Bitcoin, the consequences of the crash in derivatives markets and the next potential targets for Bitcoin’s price. Bitcoin’s Crash Aftermath \u0026 Next Moves Just as banks were releasing Bitcoin price predictions of six figures, Bitcoin and broader crypto markets incurred a steep correction. In last week’s piece, we had outlined a few indicators of the market being overheated following an impressive rally that saw Bitcoin and Ethereum more than double in less than thirty days. Now that both Bitcoin and Ethereum have dropped approximately 20%, we assess some of the potential reasons for the downward trend and where Bitcoin may be heading next. As always, the analysis is based on key on-chain and market metrics, but is not to be used as financial advice. Signs That Bitcoin’s Rally Was Over-Extended Short-term interest in Bitcoin had been quite high — as in the highest it had been since 2017. This is evident both in blockchain data and in Google searches. With regards to Bitcoin’s on-chain data, IntoTheBlock’s Traders metric tracks the number of addresses with a weighted average holding time under a month. This indicator reached its highest level in over three years, increasing by over 17% over the last 30 days. As of Jan. 13, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin ownership indicators This demonstrates that addresses were following Bitcoin’s rally, with an increasing amount of addresses and holdings being allocated to traders. The pattern, reminiscent of previous hype cycles, highlights the high speculation that had been taking place over the last couple of weeks. In contrast, the number of addresses and volume hodling — categorized by IntoTheBlock as those holding for over one year — has been decreasing. This is the first month in over two years that the number of Bitcoin hodlers dropped, for hodlers had even managed to grow throughout the 50% crash experienced in March 2020. The number of Bitcoin owned by hodlers dropped by over 2% in the past 30 days, pointing to the likelihood of profit-taking following the strong price run-up. Perhaps unsurprisingly, search trends for Bitcoin had also been growing significantly along with its price. Google search trends reached their highest yearly level and second highest in its 12-year history. This further supports the thesis that large amounts of speculation have been taking place over the last few months. As of Jan. 3, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin social indicators Historical Liquidations The crash led to one of the largest liquidations in perpetual swaps ever seen in crypto. Nearly $2.5 billion in long positions were liquidated within 24 hours, second only to those seen in the Black Thursday market plunge. Transition As of Jan. 13, 2021 via The Block Data The historical level of liquidations suggests that derivatives traders had been over-leveraged chasing the rally. This aligns with the high number of traders seen on-chain and is a direct consequence of the excessive speculation that had been taking place. Where Is Crypto Heading Next? Following the aftermath of a precipitous crash, traders may be wondering what comes next for Bitcoin and other crypto-assets. By analyzing the profitability of traders near the current price of Bitcoin, we can analyze the current circumstances and price ranges expected to act as support and resistance. As of Jan, 13, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin financial indicators Through the In/Out of the Money Around Price (IOMAP), we observe that 51% of the Bitcoin held within 30% of the current price is currently out of the money, or experiencing losses on paper. This turns the tables for the bulls, as many of the traders that chased the highs are likely to cut their losses or break-even if they get the chance to do so. The size of each cluster in the IOMAP represents the volume of BTC previously bought in a specified price range. We observe a high amount of resistance between $33.5K to $34.5K, as this had previously been an area of significant buying activity where holders may look to sell. If this range is broken, the next level to watch out for is between $37.5K to $38.6K, where 323K BTC had previously been bought. Overall, this highlights two strong resistance levels to surpass before Bitcoin is able to set new highs. On the other hand, the next range with significant support for Bitcoin is around $31K, the recent lows from this week’s crash. This key buying area would have to hold to avoid a steeper correction from occurring.

    "detailedContent": "After being mopped up by the troop of WallStreetBetters, the cryptocurrency market gradually steps into a relatively stable period. The volatility caused by miners’ selling has been completely absorbed by the market. Bitcoin price climbed back above $36,000. The crypto’s price performance shows a gradual climb back to a high-level trend with a typical characteristic — the price increases with a lower trading volume. High Price With Low Volume This week, the trading volume of Bitcoin has rebounded compared to last week, but the biggest influence factor comes from the actions of WallStreetBet retail investors during the weekend. After Elon Musk tweeted \"Bitcoin\" on Jan. 29, Bitcoin spot trading volume reached a daily high of $20.63 billion on Jan. 30, and then fell back to normal levels the next day. From the monthly chart, the impact of retail investors is limited indeed, for the impact from miners’ sell-off in mid-January was much greater than that from retail investors. The miners’ sell-off caused a price shock period of nearly a month, while a large number of retail investors only caused a jump in price and trading volume on the same day. BTC trading volume in the last 30 days, chart from 11:00 pm EST, Feb. 4 .Source: tokeninsight.com Although the trading volume is flat, the Bitcoin price has changed significantly. The upward trend of volatility starting from last week has continued, but the increase is faster. As of 11:00 pm on Feb. 4th, the price of Bitcoin has risen to higher than $37,000. The shock caused by the miner sell-off in January seems to have been basically absorbed by the market, and the lower trading volume indicates that the market\u0027s expectations for Bitcoin are generally more positive, and there are many people who hold the cryptos on the sidelines. This shows that the price of Bitcoin will rise further in the near future. The continued increase in the prices of major exchange platform tokens and decentralized lending platform tokens also provides evidence for possible future price increases. From last year\u0027s data, Bitcoin is closely related to large-scale exchanges’ platform tokens and decentralized lending platform tokens. The rise of the latter two often indicates the recent rise in the prices of mainstream cryptos. BTC price in the last 30 days, chart from 8:00pm EST, Feb 4.

Source: tokeninsight.com Gas Fee Surges ATH with ETH Prices, DeFi Seems to Be Soaring Back After becoming the best performing crypto in 2020, Ethereum does not seem to stop moving forward. The recent volatility of Ethereum also showed similar characteristics of \"high price and low volume\" in the last week. Ethereum\u0027s weekly spot trading volume is $41.51B, a slight decrease of 0.62% from last week, basically the same, while the volume of perpetual contracts is only $151B, a slight increase compared to last week, but the spot price rises all the way and breaks through $ 1,600 per ETH, which is a new all-time-high. The booming price has pushed gas fees to a new high, and the average cost reached more than $20 this Thursday. The flourishing DeFi market is the root cause of the increase in gas fees and Ethereum prices. Under the leadership of mainstream DeFi projects such as Uniswap and Aave, the total DeFi value locked has increased by 16.37% in 24 hours. Moreover, starting from 2021, the pressure of transaction settlement on the Ethernet network has reached a new high, pushing the gas fee to an average historical peak of $23.27 per transaction, but user demand has not declined. It can be seen that DeFi in 2021 is soaring. ETH price and gas fee changes in the last 30 days, chart from 1:00am EST, Feb 5.

On the other hand, despite the recent relatively sluggish options market, the number of contracts traded on Ethereum options has always been much higher than the number of Bitcoin contracts in Deribit, and most of contracts are short-term option contracts mainly, which indicates that a large number of traders are using option tools to hedge possible trading risks.

    "detailedContent": "Non-fungible tokens, or NFTs as they are more commonly known, are digital assets such as art, trading cards, collectibles and even virtual pets. What makes NFTs so appealing to collectors is that because they are non-fungible, no two are alike. Rarity and scarcity are inherently built into NFTs. Also, because they are on the blockchain, their authenticity can be easily verified. NBA Top Shot is a collaboration between Dapper Labs, the creators of Top Shot, and the National Basketball Association. These digital trading cards are licensed highlight clips, called moments, from NBA games. These highlights are packaged and sold in digital packs that allow collectors to own a numbered version of the highlight. Collectors can keep, sell or trade their highlights amongst other Top Shot collectors. NBA Top Shots are rapidly growing in popularity, with prices climbing to hundreds of thousands of dollars per moment: see this moment with Zion Williamson or this one with LeBron James. Everyone can see which Top Shot is selling for the most. We wanted to look at transactions to see which one had exchanged hands the most — as a proxy for popularity. The most traded Top Shot moment features Cole Anthony. Anthony is currently in his rookie year with the Orlando Magic. This moment has been sold 9 times — most moments have been resold just once. Highlights are typically sold in packs ranging from $9.00 to $230.00. Depending on the player, highlight, or the scarcity of a particular moment, Top Shot prices can skyrocket. Case in point: A LeBron James moment recently sold for over $70K. Some asking prices are now in the 6 figures. The sports memorabilia market is currently a $5B industry. Looks like NBA Top Shot is poised to take its shot for a share of that market.

    "title": "Wall Street Bets Concept Tokens Stirred Up the Crypto Market: Weekly Market Review by TokenInsight",
    "detailedContent": "This week, investors focused on areas outside the crypto market. Individual investors from all over the world gathered in U.S. stocks. After the appeal from Wall Street Bets on Reddit around Gamestop, American Cinemas (AMC), Nokia (NOK) and other stocks, individual investors defeated Wall Street’s short hedge funds for the first time and broke the myth of “institutions never are defeated by individuals.” Compared with the crazy traditional market, the crypto market was relatively calm. After a fortnight of volatility, mainstream crypto prices began to stabilize and slowly recovered. Platform cryptos and blue chip tokens have also stabilized. But when individual investors on Wall Street Bet began to focus on digital assets, the enthusiasm they brought instantly caused a huge shock in the altcoin market. DOGE, MIR, etc. which is related to GME, and even just the tokens named by the Wall Street Bets team, the price and trading volume has exploded. When fanaticism prevails, how long can the short-term consensus from the huge community last without being \"unplugged\"? Let us walk and see. Wall Street Bets Stirred the Crypto Market After the investors from Reddit won the first battle, they became the \"heroes\" in the hearts of individual investors worldwide. As they began to turn their attention to cryptocurrencies, investors began to flock to some altcoins. For them, the crypto market does not seem to be different from the traditional market. Wall Street Bets only mentioned DOGE (a long-established altcoin) on Twitter, and then its price was pushed four times within 24 hours, from \"almost no value\" to more than 7 cents. Moreover, Its 24-hour trading volume is even more outrageous, rising by 11,486.57% (approximately 115 times) to 25.54 billion U.S. dollars, reaching a level close to half of the weekly Bitcoin trading volume in one day, and the market value of DOGE has also reached 8.98 billion U.S. dollars, an increase of 465.12% in one day, and took the seventh place in market share in one fell swoop. DOGE price \u0026 volume in the last 30 days, chart from 6:30am EST, Jan 29. Source: tokeninsight.com The GameStop-supported assets from the crypto market has also allowed exchanges and projects that provide related services to obtain substantial returns. The FTX exchange launched GME\u0027s equity token. In the past 24 hours, the GME token’s spot trading volume has reached $5.18 million, while the quarterly delivery contract trading volume is just $6.18 million;.After the decentralized synthetic asset protocol called Mirror Protocol initiated a vote in the community to add ‘GME’ to the asset pool, the price of MIR rose by 29% and remained at around $4.39. As a result, the market cap of Mirror exceeded $100 million, reaching $120 million. MIR price \u0026 volume in the last 30 days, chart from 2:30am EST, Jan 29. Source: coinmarketcap Bicoin seems to be the next target. On Jan, 29 at 4:00 EST, Bitcoin witnessed a sudden double-digit spike from $32,000 at around 4:30 EST and jumped to near $38,000, the highest level since Jan. 19. This 16% rise range has already exceeded the drop range compared with last round drop-back (from $3,400 to $3,200) waving the crypto communities hot. This jump seems to be related with Tesla and SpaceX’s CEO Elon Musk, who just changed his Twitter bio into #Bitcoin. According to a report by Coindesk, while the Bitcoin community is keen for Musk to come out as a supporter, he seemingly enjoys dropping crypto mentions as something of a tease. BTC price in the last 24 hours, chart from 4:30am EST, Jan 29. Source: tokeninsight.com When individual investors ‘aggregated fish as giant sharks’ and made a huge noise in the traditional market, although the crypto market has become accustomed to price changes in the thousands or even tens of thousands dollars fluctuation level, the huge risks brought by the influx of a large number of enthusiastic investors is still worthy of vigilance. However, does their behaviour implicitly show that consensus is the source of value? If people\u0027s consensus begins to gather on a certain underlying asset, the asset is given value? The next step for individual investors from Wall Street Bet is worth our observation and thinking.

    "detailedContent": "Every week, IntoTheBlock brings you on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. DOGE-Mania Continues Dogecoin has outperformed beyond comprehension. The meme token reached a market cap as high as $88 billion on Wednesday, over 70% of Coinbase’s market cap and behind only Bitcoin, Ethereum and BNB in crypto markets. The most recent run-up has been linked by many to the anticipation of Elon Musk’s Saturday Night Live show on May 8. The Tesla founder teased his show by referring to himself as the Dogefather. As of May 5, 2021 via Twitter Since Elon’s tweet, DOGE has increased as much as 150% within less than two weeks. Typically things like these are preceded with a “correlation does not imply causation” type of disclaimer — but who are we kidding? It has become apparent time and again that Elon Musk, and to some extent Mark Cuban, has enough of a following to cause ripples throughout markets, with Bloomberg’s Matt Levine even dubbing it the Elon Markets Hypothesis, parodically referencing the efficient market hypothesis framework. Beyond the most recent rally, DOGE has vastly outperformed in 2021. The meme token has managed to appreciate a whopping 13,700% within five months 🤯 As of May 5, 2021 via CoinMarketCap The massive rally has even caught the eye of traditional media outlets like CNBC, The New York Times and CNN. Much viral, indeed. Linked to these stories typically are stories of people making fortunes or simulations of how much money people could have made. While these anecdotes highlight the outlier scenarios, on-chain data provides a more accurate picture of how Dogecoin holders have benefited from the parabolic run-up. By dividing a token’s market cap over the total number of addresses holding a token, IntoTheBlock obtains the average balance for a holder. In DOGE’s case, the average balance of a holder is currently $21,000, up from $217 at the beginning of 2021. As of May 5, 2021 through IntoTheBlock’s DOGE financial metrics This increase in average balance is certainly remarkable (~97x), though not as high as its price appreciation (~136x). The retail-driven mania comes as TikTok influencers have been predicting $1 DOGE over the last few months. While many hope this will occur — and it still might — activity on the blockchain has decreased relative to prior periods of hype. As of May 5, 2021 through IntoTheBlock’s DOGE financial metrics As can be seen in the graph above, daily active addresses for DOGE hit a lower high despite prices extending to new highs. This points to the recent price action being driven by less players, potentially signalling decreasing momentum. Overall, crypto markets have been taken by surprise on the meteoric rise of DOGE. Although it is impossible to predict if it will reach the coveted dollar mark, the hype around it has become evident throughout its price run-up and extensive media coverage. Ultimately, though it may not be the most popular thing to say, investors should stay cautious as many anticipate Elon’s SNL debut, but the market may be setting the bar too high.

    "title": "Alt Season Takes a Break as Bitcoin Hits $50k: A Data Perspective by IntoTheBlock",
    "detailedContent": "Every week, IntoTheBlock brings you on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. This week we analyze the influence MicroStrategy and other institutional investors have had on Bitcoin as it reaches the psychological level of $50,000. Moreover, we dive into crypto’s alt season and how it was affected by Bitcoin’s recent milestone. Bitcoin $50K Propelled by Institutional Activity 4,427 days after its genesis block, Bitcoin has managed to reach a price of $50,000 for the first time. Throughout this time, Bitcoin has taken a life of its own, progressing from Satoshi Nakamoto’s original peer-to-peer cash vision to anonymous darknet money to digital gold. While these narratives have evolved throughout Bitcoin’s cycles, in one shape or another they have propelled the cryptocurrency all the way to the $50k milestone. In terms of the current leading narrative, at IntoTheBlock we have extensively covered Bitcoin’s institutional adoption and Bitcoin as digital gold as two intertwined forces behind the current rally. This time, MicroStrategy is being pointed to as the responsible entity behind the spike to $50,000. The business intelligence firm has announced plans to issue $600 million worth of convertible notes with the proceeds used to buy Bitcoin. By doing so, MicroStrategy is effectively issuing debt to add to its Bitcoin holdings, leveraging up their position. This would be the second time Michael Saylor’s company has done this, which explains why the company’s stock (MSTR) has been trading almost as an unofficial leveraged Bitcoin ETF. As of Feb. 16, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Capital Markets Insights The correlation between Bitcoin’s and MicroStrategy’s stock prices has been remarkably strong with a 30-day correlation coefficient of 0.93 at the time of writing. Beyond MicroStrategy, an increasing number of institutions are looking into Bitcoin. Within the past year institutional heavy weights such as BlackRock, JP Morgan, BNY Mellon and Morgan Stanley have made major steps towards providing Bitcoin investing with their own and their clients’ funds. While they haven’t announced any buying activity yet, these and other corporations are likely already investing in Bitcoin. This is noticeable in Bitcoin’s transparent blockchain data. Moreover, several companies may choose to follow Tesla’s approach, buying Bitcoin privately and enjoying high returns after disclosing their purchase. IntoTheBlock’s large transactions volume indicator aggregates the total volume sent in transfers worth over $100,000. Given the magnitude of this amount, large transactions volume act as a proxy to the level of institutional activity taking place on-chain. As of Feb. 16, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin Financial metrics The growth in large transaction volume has been astounding, increasing tenfold from a daily average of $8 billion in 2017 to $80 billion so far in 2021. Bitcoin also recently recorded its first week with daily large transaction volume of over $100 billion. Alt Season Takes a Break Although Bitcoin has taken most of the headlines in crypto, other crypto-assets often referred to as altcoins have been leading the way in terms of price performance in 2021. This has been reflected in Bitcoin’s declining market dominance as well as in the price performance of top 10 cryptoassets by market capitalization. As of Feb. 16, 7PM (EST) via CoinMarketCap While several cryptoassets have more than doubled in 2021, we are observing DeFi and smart contract protocol tokens outperform in particular. This trend, though, slowed down for the most part on Feb. 16 as Bitcoin reached the $50K mark. Put in aggregate, the total market cap of altcoins is currently at all-time highs, surpassing its previous high a few days ago. As of Feb. 16 7PM (EST) via CoinMarketCap With nearly $600 billion worth of value in altcoins, it is fair to say that there is much more to crypto than just Bitcoin. While the recent milestone of $50K halted the trend in altcoins outperforming, it is yet to be seen if alt season is stepping back or if it is just getting started.

    "title": "Ethereum’s Catalysts \u0026 Contrasting Forces: A Data Perspective by IntoTheBlock",
    "detailedContent": "Every week, IntoTheBlock brings you on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. This week, we analyze Ethereum’s remarkable performance and its current state between long-term growth drivers and short-term forces weighing down. Ethereum’s Catalysts \u0026 Contrasting Forces After underperforming Bitcoin in Q4, Ether’s price has managed to grow by over 45% in the first week of January, compared to Bitcoin’s 16% increase. Having officially launched phase zero of ETH 2.0 in December, Ethereum has seen a wave of positive events unfold. While these are driving a confluence of improvements for Ethereum’s long-term potential, short-term metrics point to the recent rally being over-extended. On the institutional front, the CME announced in mid-December the launch of Ether futures set for February 2021. This would make it the only the second crypto-asset to be traded in regulated American futures exchanges, roughly four years after the first Bitcoin futures in CME. Along with this and Ether’s price growth, institutional activity in Ethereum has increased tremendously. IntoTheBlock’s Large Transactions Volume aggregates the volume transferred in transactions of over $100k, acting as a proxy to institutional activity. This metric surpassed $10 billion in daily volume for the first time since January 2018. As of Jan. 5, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Ethereum financial indicators Spikes in large transactions volume tends to coincide with periods of high volatility such as the one Ether is currently experiencing, potentially due to profit-taking. Even though the recent increase in large transactions volume may be attributed to Ether’s recent price performance, the CME Ether futures are expected to continue to drive institutional adoption for Ethereum. More recently, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) announced that banks can facilitate and issue their own stablecoins. Contrary to many of the points proposed in the Stable Act, this encourages the usage of public blockchains where stablecoins are settled, such as Ethereum. Furthermore, through the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559, Ether would be burned as a result from increased usage in stablecoins, effectively reducing its supply as transaction volume grows. These improvements are expected to act as catalysts for Ethereum’s long-term growth. In light of Ether’s recent outstanding price performance, though, derivatives and on-chain metrics have been flashing warning signs. Perpetual swaps — a type of derivatives contract that does not expire — use a mechanism known as the funding rate to artificially peg contract prices to those seen in spot markets. Whenever perpetual swaps’ prices are above spot prices, long holders of the contract pay the funding rate to short holders, typically every eight hours. As of Jan. 5, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Ethereum derivatives indicators With the recent run-up in Ether prices, funding rates hit an all-time high for exchanges such as Binance and FTX. This points to a significant premium between derivatives and spot markets, highlighting the disproportionate allocation towards Ether long positions. On-chain, we also observe potential signs of profit-taking. Particularly, inflows into centralized exchanges can often indicate holders looking to sell their positions. The reasoning behind this is that holders may have their assets in cold storage or in non-custodial wallets, where they are either unable to sell or would incur higher fees if they decide to do so there versus in centralized exchanges. Exchanges’ netflows monitor the total amount of deposits into exchanges minus withdrawals. When netflows are positive, more money is entering than leaving exchanges. Aggregate netflows for Ether reached their highest level since February 2018. As of Jan. 5, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Ethereum exchanges indicators While certainly not all deposits into centralized exchanges are due to holders looking to sell, the sudden spike coinciding with Ether’s 40% appreciation within a week does suggest at least some level of profit-taking. Overall, Ethereum is currently in a very interesting position: on the cusp of catalysts accelerating its long-term growth, but at the mercy of short-term market forces. While Ethereum’s increasing institutional adoption and approval for stablecoin usage point to positive developments, over-extended funding rates and high netflows urge caution.

    "title": "Introducing the New CoinMarketCap Crypto Price Prediction and Estimates: Methodology and Product Features",
    "detailedContent": "CoinMarketCap is introducing a new feature that enables users to provide the price predictions and estimates for their favorite crypto assets! Understanding that price predictions and estimates are key information to navigate in this market to gauge the trading sentiment of various assets, the goal of this new feature is to provide convenience by aggregating the market’s estimates in a standardized format. Users are able to view the estimate averages for any asset instead of needing to ask in various asset price discussion chat groups. Much like sell-side equity research reports in traditional financial markets, users are now able to compare the asset price performance with market expectations. Where to Find the Price Predictions \u0026 Estimates A new Price Estimates tab is added in every asset detail page (e.g. Bitcoin) — the prediction statistics for the next six month-ends are displayed when there are more than 30 submissions for each month-end. If there are less than 30 estimates submitted, the statistics will not be published due to the lack of sample size for us to perform data cleaning processes like filtering outliers and extreme values. Estimates data are also summarized in the charts to show the estimated trend and the distribution of submissions. How to Submit Estimates \u0026 Data Lock Period Users can submit their estimates in the new Price Estimates tab after they have logged in their CoinMarketCap account. Estimates submitted can be edited anytime without limit by clicking on the Edit button before the cut off date of every month, the 21 of each month for the respective month-end. For example, the last day for a user to change his/her prediction for the price of Bitcoin at the end of May would be on May 21. We have designed this data lock period so as to display statistics that reflect the market’s expectations rather than just being very close numbers from one day before. Data Processing by CoinMarketCap As the data aggregator, these are the processes we perform after users have submitted their estimates: Eligible assets: Currently, the feature is open for all assets tracked by CoinMarketCap. Minimum number of submissions for publishing statistics: Estimate statistics are published once more than 30 estimates are submitted, this is designed to ensure that the data sample size is large enough for us to perform other data cleaning processes. Outliers filtering: Currently we are using the 1.5 x IQR (interquartile range) as the main method to remove outliers, we are still testing and exploring other methods such as clustering to produce more meaningful statistics and to avoid any hostile data pollution. Extreme value filtering: We remove certain extreme values case-by-case based on the assets in question. Historical accuracy calculation: We calculate the historical estimate accuracy by comparing the volume weighted average price of the month-end date with the estimate average to provide more transparency. Potential Future Development As price prediction and estimate data are popular within communities, we hope this is only the first stage of the product and we are also planning for other features to continuously improve the data offering as well as increase the user engagement opportunities if this feature is well-received by our user community. In the future, you may see predictors’ individual profiles, leaderboard, and many more interesting features! --- We genuinely hope that you enjoy this new feature and it will bring you useful insights related to the market expectations and sentiment! Please bear with us while we are fine-tuning the product with initial user data and let us know if you have any feedback on the new product on Twitter or in our Telegram channel!

    "title": "Mirror, Mirror on the Wall: Flipside Crypto",
    "detailedContent": "Time to take a look at Mirror, a recently launched protocol from Terra that’s making big waves and attracting some serious attention. What Is Mirror? Late last year, crypto standout Terra debuted the Mirror Protocol, a new synthetic asset platform designed to help users gain access and price exposure to real-world assets. Mirror allows for the tracking, issuing and trading of these assets, such as U.S. equities like stocks, via Mirrored Assets, also known as mAssets. MAssets are synthetic derivatives of real-world assets and as the name implies, work to mirror their exchange prices on-chain. Traders outside the United States know how difficult it can be to access the stock market. And, after several controversies regarding retail trading here in the United States, even domestic traders probably don’t need a reminder of why a token such as this may pose some advantages. Mirror seeks to help both of these users by giving them the ability to participate directly in investment or speculation on price even if they don’t own the underlying asset. So far, the intended audience seems to be receptive, and Mirror is making its presence felt among traders. Liquidity has been growing steadily, reaching a high of just under 624M UST as of 5 PM on Monday, while the traded volume of Mirror reached nearly 54M UST. Why Does Mirror Matter? So, what to make of Mirror? There’s no doubt that this protocol holds major potential. That’s especially true when you consider not only the scores of international traders looking to get some stake in American companies, but also thousands of American retail traders frustrated by their experiences during the GameStop fiasco earlier this year who swore they would be looking for an alternative entry point to the stock market. Mirror may not offer a perfect solution to that problem — after all, these are synthetic derivatives and don’t provide any ownership of the stocks they represent — but like many other Terra projects, it’s designed to help bridge the gap for those looking for new ways to access traditional finance and trading options. If they’re successful, there’s a reason to believe in a big, beautiful future for Mirror and the entire Terra ecosystem. Get Involved Want to learn more about the Mirror protocol and the team behind it? Just visit the Mirror website, read the white paper, and join their community on Telegram or Discord.

Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. Ethereum Fees Hit ATHs Amid Uncanny Dog-Token Frenzy Ethereum has become notorious for its high fees during this bull market. For better or worse, Ethereum users have dealt with fees as high as $100 for simple ERC-20 token transactions. While these transaction fees typically price out retail users, there currently has been an outrageous amount of speculation surrounding dog-themed tokens on Ethereum. Following DOGE-mania, Shiba Inu (SHIB) and similar tokens have attempted to steal the meme token’s spotlight, with one even being named Doge Killer (LEASH). These tokens — as ridiculous as they sound — have been seeing transaction volumes in the hundreds of millions of dollars as their prices defy gravity. As of May 11, 2021 via CoinMarketCap The parabolic returns have enticed retail users with many willing to spend triple digits in Ethereum gas fees to gamble on potentially higher profits. As a result, five out of the top ten trading pairs over the past 24 hours pertain to dog-related tokens, including DogeIon Mars (ELON)... As of May 11, 2021 through IntoTheBlock’s DEX Insights ‍The high amount in trading fees for these pairs has resulted in the projected return on liquidity (ROL) for liquidity providers to currently be as high as 1,900% yearly. It is important to note, though, that these returns are likely to drop as either a) volumes (and therefore fees) drop or b) more liquidity providers enter the market diminishing the returns obtained on average. A mix of both of these is also likely. The current dog-coin speculation — along with existing demand for decentralized applications — has led to record high fees on Ethereum. Over $89 million was spent on Ethereum fees on May 10. As of May 11, 2021 through IntoTheBlock’s DeFi Network Insights Moreover, within a single hour Ethereum managed to accrue more fees ($5.78 million) than Bitcoin throughout the whole day ($5.71 million). Uniswap V2 was responsible for a high amount of the Ethereum fees with $6.85 million on May 10. More often than not, these high fees are discussed as prohibitive for retail users given that day-to-day users may not be able to afford them. The current dog-token rally may prove to be the exception to the rule, likely due to traders projecting previous returns into the future. While fees certainly need to decrease in order for broader mainstream adoption to take place, they also showcase the vast demand to use blockchain-based applications. This is the case as fees illustrate the willingness to pay for blockspace; given that the amount of transactions that fit within a block is limited, fees dynamically adjust based on demand. Additionally, in the case of Ethereum, upgrades such as EIP 1559 seek to capitalize on high fees as part of transaction fees (referred to as the basefee) will result in ETH supply being burned. This is likely to lead to ETH’s supply becoming deflationary as usage and payments adoption on Ethereum grows. Overall, the uncanny dog-token rally has reopened the debate of high fees being positive or negative for a blockchain. While it is certain that users are getting left out due to the high fees, the impressive demand to use blockchain applications does suggest higher adoption down the road, especially as scalability solutions become implemented.

    "title": "Crypto Consolidates as New Interest Cools Down, but Potential Catalysts Emerge : A Data Perspective by IntoTheBlock",
    "detailedContent": "Powered by Every week, IntoTheBlock brings you on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. Crypto markets have been trading sideways or slightly down for the most part throughout June. As the price of Bitcoin consolidates around the low $30,000s, blockchain activity is cooling off, but institutional interest prevails with several large players entering or doubling down on crypto. As of July 1, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Capital Markets Insights In terms of price, Bitcoin closed the month down nearly 5% at $35,000; a relatively stable month by crypto standards. On the other hand, Ethereum took a bigger hit, dropping 17%, but still managing to close above the $2,000 threshold. As prices settle down, newcomers are starting to fade. The number of Bitcoin active addresses and new ones being created has fallen steeply, closely following price activity. As of July 1, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin Network Indicators This pattern has played out time and again, with retail investors often being attracted to enter after months of upwards price action. At a price of $35,000, these addresses that bought near the top consist of approximately 30% of all holders, as indicated by IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin in/out of the money metric. Although retail activity is slowing down, large players appear to be setting up moves in the crypto market. Amongst these is a16z, which announced its third crypto fund, raising $2.2 billion — the highest so far for any crypto-focused venture capital fund. Traditional hedge funds not yet in crypto are also eyeing moves into the space. Most notably, Point72, a $22 billion hedge fund is hiring a Head of Crypto. Billionaire George Soros’ family office also started trading Bitcoin recently. As funds like these get started, a new wave of institutional money is likely to continue pushing crypto forward, much like how it happened in late 2020. Large transactions volume, which tracks the aggregate amount transferred in transactions of over $100,000, acts as a proxy to monitor flows from institutional players and whales. This metric has also appeared to cool off, but still remains much higher than it was a year ago. As of July 1, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin Financial Indicators While institutional activity on a daily basis seems to have settled down, it is worth noting that large players like these often invest with a multi-year time horizon. Therefore, it is normal for large transaction volume to drop-short term, and this does not mean institutions have left or sold their crypto. As these hedge funds look into crypto, there is a race towards offering them the most convenient way to invest in Bitcoin: an ETF. Most recently Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest joined the list of dozens (hundreds?) of firms to file for a Bitcoin ETF. With applications for a Bitcoin ETF tracing as far back as 2013, it is fair to say that there is plenty of anticipation for a product like this to come to market. Making investing in Bitcoin as convenient as in any other asset is likely to be a massive catalyst for hedge funds and other traditional investors. Overall, there is this contrast between retail interest fading away and institutional players looking to get in. As this demand adds up and prices consolidate, it is likely that crypto markets are taking a break prior to continuing the bull market.

Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. This week, we analyze Bitcoin’s crash from a data perspective. Specifically, we take a look at the indicators of excessive speculation in Bitcoin, the consequences of the crash in derivatives markets and the next potential targets for Bitcoin’s price. Bitcoin’s Crash Aftermath \u0026 Next Moves Just as banks were releasing Bitcoin price predictions of six figures, Bitcoin and broader crypto markets incurred a steep correction. In last week’s piece, we had outlined a few indicators of the market being overheated following an impressive rally that saw Bitcoin and Ethereum more than double in less than thirty days. Now that both Bitcoin and Ethereum have dropped approximately 20%, we assess some of the potential reasons for the downward trend and where Bitcoin may be heading next. As always, the analysis is based on key on-chain and market metrics, but is not to be used as financial advice. Signs That Bitcoin’s Rally Was Over-Extended Short-term interest in Bitcoin had been quite high — as in the highest it had been since 2017. This is evident both in blockchain data and in Google searches. With regards to Bitcoin’s on-chain data, IntoTheBlock’s Traders metric tracks the number of addresses with a weighted average holding time under a month. This indicator reached its highest level in over three years, increasing by over 17% over the last 30 days. As of Jan. 13, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin ownership indicators This demonstrates that addresses were following Bitcoin’s rally, with an increasing amount of addresses and holdings being allocated to traders. The pattern, reminiscent of previous hype cycles, highlights the high speculation that had been taking place over the last couple of weeks. In contrast, the number of addresses and volume hodling — categorized by IntoTheBlock as those holding for over one year — has been decreasing. This is the first month in over two years that the number of Bitcoin hodlers dropped, for hodlers had even managed to grow throughout the 50% crash experienced in March 2020. The number of Bitcoin owned by hodlers dropped by over 2% in the past 30 days, pointing to the likelihood of profit-taking following the strong price run-up. Perhaps unsurprisingly, search trends for Bitcoin had also been growing significantly along with its price. Google search trends reached their highest yearly level and second highest in its 12-year history. This further supports the thesis that large amounts of speculation have been taking place over the last few months. As of Jan. 3, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin social indicators Historical Liquidations The crash led to one of the largest liquidations in perpetual swaps ever seen in crypto. Nearly $2.5 billion in long positions were liquidated within 24 hours, second only to those seen in the Black Thursday market plunge. Transition As of Jan. 13, 2021 via The Block Data The historical level of liquidations suggests that derivatives traders had been over-leveraged chasing the rally. This aligns with the high number of traders seen on-chain and is a direct consequence of the excessive speculation that had been taking place. Where Is Crypto Heading Next? Following the aftermath of a precipitous crash, traders may be wondering what comes next for Bitcoin and other crypto-assets. By analyzing the profitability of traders near the current price of Bitcoin, we can analyze the current circumstances and price ranges expected to act as support and resistance. As of Jan, 13, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin financial indicators Through the In/Out of the Money Around Price (IOMAP), we observe that 51% of the Bitcoin held within 30% of the current price is currently out of the money, or experiencing losses on paper. This turns the tables for the bulls, as many of the traders that chased the highs are likely to cut their losses or break-even if they get the chance to do so. The size of each cluster in the IOMAP represents the volume of BTC previously bought in a specified price range. We observe a high amount of resistance between $33.5K to $34.5K, as this had previously been an area of significant buying activity where holders may look to sell. If this range is broken, the next level to watch out for is between $37.5K to $38.6K, where 323K BTC had previously been bought. Overall, this highlights two strong resistance levels to surpass before Bitcoin is able to set new highs. On the other hand, the next range with significant support for Bitcoin is around $31K, the recent lows from this week’s crash. This key buying area would have to hold to avoid a steeper correction from occurring.

    "title": "Temporary Silence?: Weekly Market Review by TokenInsight",
    "detailedContent": "After being mopped up by the troop of WallStreetBetters, the cryptocurrency market gradually steps into a relatively stable period. The volatility caused by miners’ selling has been completely absorbed by the market. Bitcoin price climbed back above $36,000. The crypto’s price performance shows a gradual climb back to a high-level trend with a typical characteristic — the price increases with a lower trading volume. High Price With Low Volume This week, the trading volume of Bitcoin has rebounded compared to last week, but the biggest influence factor comes from the actions of WallStreetBet retail investors during the weekend. After Elon Musk tweeted \"Bitcoin\" on Jan. 29, Bitcoin spot trading volume reached a daily high of $20.63 billion on Jan. 30, and then fell back to normal levels the next day. From the monthly chart, the impact of retail investors is limited indeed, for the impact from miners’ sell-off in mid-January was much greater than that from retail investors. The miners’ sell-off caused a price shock period of nearly a month, while a large number of retail investors only caused a jump in price and trading volume on the same day. BTC trading volume in the last 30 days, chart from 11:00 pm EST, Feb. 4 .Source: tokeninsight.com Although the trading volume is flat, the Bitcoin price has changed significantly. The upward trend of volatility starting from last week has continued, but the increase is faster. As of 11:00 pm on Feb. 4th, the price of Bitcoin has risen to higher than $37,000. The shock caused by the miner sell-off in January seems to have been basically absorbed by the market, and the lower trading volume indicates that the market\u0027s expectations for Bitcoin are generally more positive, and there are many people who hold the cryptos on the sidelines. This shows that the price of Bitcoin will rise further in the near future. The continued increase in the prices of major exchange platform tokens and decentralized lending platform tokens also provides evidence for possible future price increases. From last year\u0027s data, Bitcoin is closely related to large-scale exchanges’ platform tokens and decentralized lending platform tokens. The rise of the latter two often indicates the recent rise in the prices of mainstream cryptos. BTC price in the last 30 days, chart from 8:00pm EST, Feb 4.

Source: tokeninsight.com Gas Fee Surges ATH with ETH Prices, DeFi Seems to Be Soaring Back After becoming the best performing crypto in 2020, Ethereum does not seem to stop moving forward. The recent volatility of Ethereum also showed similar characteristics of \"high price and low volume\" in the last week. Ethereum\u0027s weekly spot trading volume is $41.51B, a slight decrease of 0.62% from last week, basically the same, while the volume of perpetual contracts is only $151B, a slight increase compared to last week, but the spot price rises all the way and breaks through $ 1,600 per ETH, which is a new all-time-high. The booming price has pushed gas fees to a new high, and the average cost reached more than $20 this Thursday. The flourishing DeFi market is the root cause of the increase in gas fees and Ethereum prices. Under the leadership of mainstream DeFi projects such as Uniswap and Aave, the total DeFi value locked has increased by 16.37% in 24 hours. Moreover, starting from 2021, the pressure of transaction settlement on the Ethernet network has reached a new high, pushing the gas fee to an average historical peak of $23.27 per transaction, but user demand has not declined. It can be seen that DeFi in 2021 is soaring. ETH price and gas fee changes in the last 30 days, chart from 1:00am EST, Feb 5.

On the other hand, despite the recent relatively sluggish options market, the number of contracts traded on Ethereum options has always been much higher than the number of Bitcoin contracts in Deribit, and most of contracts are short-term option contracts mainly, which indicates that a large number of traders are using option tools to hedge possible trading risks.

    "title": "What Is the Most Traded NBA Top Shot?: Flipside Crypto",
    "detailedContent": "Non-fungible tokens, or NFTs as they are more commonly known, are digital assets such as art, trading cards, collectibles and even virtual pets. What makes NFTs so appealing to collectors is that because they are non-fungible, no two are alike. Rarity and scarcity are inherently built into NFTs. Also, because they are on the blockchain, their authenticity can be easily verified. NBA Top Shot is a collaboration between Dapper Labs, the creators of Top Shot, and the National Basketball Association. These digital trading cards are licensed highlight clips, called moments, from NBA games. These highlights are packaged and sold in digital packs that allow collectors to own a numbered version of the highlight. Collectors can keep, sell or trade their highlights amongst other Top Shot collectors. NBA Top Shots are rapidly growing in popularity, with prices climbing to hundreds of thousands of dollars per moment: see this moment with Zion Williamson or this one with LeBron James. Everyone can see which Top Shot is selling for the most. We wanted to look at transactions to see which one had exchanged hands the most — as a proxy for popularity. The most traded Top Shot moment features Cole Anthony. Anthony is currently in his rookie year with the Orlando Magic. This moment has been sold 9 times — most moments have been resold just once. Highlights are typically sold in packs ranging from $9.00 to $230.00. Depending on the player, highlight, or the scarcity of a particular moment, Top Shot prices can skyrocket. Case in point: A LeBron James moment recently sold for over $70K. Some asking prices are now in the 6 figures. The sports memorabilia market is currently a $5B industry. Looks like NBA Top Shot is poised to take its shot for a share of that market.

    "title": "Wall Street Bets Concept Tokens Stirred Up the Crypto Market: Weekly Market Review by TokenInsight",
    "detailedContent": "This week, investors focused on areas outside the crypto market. Individual investors from all over the world gathered in U.S. stocks. After the appeal from Wall Street Bets on Reddit around Gamestop, American Cinemas (AMC), Nokia (NOK) and other stocks, individual investors defeated Wall Street’s short hedge funds for the first time and broke the myth of “institutions never are defeated by individuals.” Compared with the crazy traditional market, the crypto market was relatively calm. After a fortnight of volatility, mainstream crypto prices began to stabilize and slowly recovered. Platform cryptos and blue chip tokens have also stabilized. But when individual investors on Wall Street Bet began to focus on digital assets, the enthusiasm they brought instantly caused a huge shock in the altcoin market. DOGE, MIR, etc. which is related to GME, and even just the tokens named by the Wall Street Bets team, the price and trading volume has exploded. When fanaticism prevails, how long can the short-term consensus from the huge community last without being \"unplugged\"? Let us walk and see. Wall Street Bets Stirred the Crypto Market After the investors from Reddit won the first battle, they became the \"heroes\" in the hearts of individual investors worldwide. As they began to turn their attention to cryptocurrencies, investors began to flock to some altcoins. For them, the crypto market does not seem to be different from the traditional market. Wall Street Bets only mentioned DOGE (a long-established altcoin) on Twitter, and then its price was pushed four times within 24 hours, from \"almost no value\" to more than 7 cents. Moreover, Its 24-hour trading volume is even more outrageous, rising by 11,486.57% (approximately 115 times) to 25.54 billion U.S. dollars, reaching a level close to half of the weekly Bitcoin trading volume in one day, and the market value of DOGE has also reached 8.98 billion U.S. dollars, an increase of 465.12% in one day, and took the seventh place in market share in one fell swoop.

The FTX exchange launched GME\u0027s equity token. In the past 24 hours, the GME token’s spot trading volume has reached $5.18 million, while the quarterly delivery contract trading volume is just $6.18 million;.After the decentralized synthetic asset protocol called Mirror Protocol initiated a vote in the community to add ‘GME’ to the asset pool, the price of MIR rose by 29% and remained at around $4.39. As a result, the market cap of Mirror exceeded $100 million, reaching $120 million. MIR price \u0026 volume in the last 30 days, chart from 2:30am EST, Jan 29.

On Jan, 29 at 4:00 EST, Bitcoin witnessed a sudden double-digit spike from $32,000 at around 4:30 EST and jumped to near $38,000, the highest level since Jan. 19. This 16% rise range has already exceeded the drop range compared with last round drop-back (from $3,400 to $3,200) waving the crypto communities hot. This jump seems to be related with Tesla and SpaceX’s CEO Elon Musk, who just changed his Twitter bio into #Bitcoin. According to a report by Coindesk, while the Bitcoin community is keen for Musk to come out as a supporter, he seemingly enjoys dropping crypto mentions as something of a tease. BTC price in the last 24 hours, chart from 4:30am EST, Jan 29. Source: tokeninsight.com When individual investors ‘aggregated fish as giant sharks’ and made a huge noise in the traditional market, although the crypto market has become accustomed to price changes in the thousands or even tens of thousands dollars fluctuation level, the huge risks brought by the influx of a large number of enthusiastic investors is still worthy of vigilance. However, does their behaviour implicitly show that consensus is the source of value? If people\u0027s consensus begins to gather on a certain underlying asset, the asset is given value? The next step for individual investors from Wall Street Bet is worth our observation and thinking.

    "title": "DOGE-Mania Continues: A Data Perspective by IntoTheBlock",
    "detailedContent": "Every week, IntoTheBlock brings you on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. DOGE-Mania Continues Dogecoin has outperformed beyond comprehension. The meme token reached a market cap as high as $88 billion on Wednesday, over 70% of Coinbase’s market cap and behind only Bitcoin, Ethereum and BNB in crypto markets. The most recent run-up has been linked by many to the anticipation of Elon Musk’s Saturday Night Live show on May 8. The Tesla founder teased his show by referring to himself as the Dogefather. As of May 5, 2021 via Twitter Since Elon’s tweet, DOGE has increased as much as 150% within less than two weeks. Typically things like these are preceded with a “correlation does not imply causation” type of disclaimer — but who are we kidding? It has become apparent time and again that Elon Musk, and to some extent Mark Cuban, has enough of a following to cause ripples throughout markets, with Bloomberg’s Matt Levine even dubbing it the Elon Markets Hypothesis, parodically referencing the efficient market hypothesis framework. Beyond the most recent rally, DOGE has vastly outperformed in 2021. The meme token has managed to appreciate a whopping 13,700% within five months 🤯 As of May 5, 2021 via CoinMarketCap The massive rally has even caught the eye of traditional media outlets like CNBC, The New York Times and CNN. Much viral, indeed. Linked to these stories typically are stories of people making fortunes or simulations of how much money people could have made. While these anecdotes highlight the outlier scenarios, on-chain data provides a more accurate picture of how Dogecoin holders have benefited from the parabolic run-up. By dividing a token’s market cap over the total number of addresses holding a token, IntoTheBlock obtains the average balance for a holder. In DOGE’s case, the average balance of a holder is currently $21,000, up from $217 at the beginning of 2021. As of May 5, 2021 through IntoTheBlock’s DOGE financial metrics This increase in average balance is certainly remarkable (~97x), though not as high as its price appreciation (~136x). The retail-driven mania comes as TikTok influencers have been predicting $1 DOGE over the last few months. While many hope this will occur — and it still might — activity on the blockchain has decreased relative to prior periods of hype. As of May 5, 2021 through IntoTheBlock’s DOGE financial metrics As can be seen in the graph above, daily active addresses for DOGE hit a lower high despite prices extending to new highs. This points to the recent price action being driven by less players, potentially signalling decreasing momentum. Overall, crypto markets have been taken by surprise on the meteoric rise of DOGE. Although it is impossible to predict if it will reach the coveted dollar mark, the hype around it has become evident throughout its price run-up and extensive media coverage. Ultimately, though it may not be the most popular thing to say, investors should stay cautious as many anticipate Elon’s SNL debut, but the market may be setting the bar too high.

    "title": "Alt Season Takes a Break as Bitcoin Hits $50k: A Data Perspective by IntoTheBlock",
    "detailedContent": "Every week, IntoTheBlock brings you on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. This week we analyze the influence MicroStrategy and other institutional investors have had on Bitcoin as it reaches the psychological level of $50,000. Moreover, we dive into crypto’s alt season and how it was affected by Bitcoin’s recent milestone. Bitcoin $50K Propelled by Institutional Activity 4,427 days after its genesis block, Bitcoin has managed to reach a price of $50,000 for the first time. Throughout this time, Bitcoin has taken a life of its own, progressing from Satoshi Nakamoto’s original peer-to-peer cash vision to anonymous darknet money to digital gold. While these narratives have evolved throughout Bitcoin’s cycles, in one shape or another they have propelled the cryptocurrency all the way to the $50k milestone. In terms of the current leading narrative, at IntoTheBlock we have extensively covered Bitcoin’s institutional adoption and Bitcoin as digital gold as two intertwined forces behind the current rally. This time, MicroStrategy is being pointed to as the responsible entity behind the spike to $50,000. The business intelligence firm has announced plans to issue $600 million worth of convertible notes with the proceeds used to buy Bitcoin. By doing so, MicroStrategy is effectively issuing debt to add to its Bitcoin holdings, leveraging up their position. This would be the second time Michael Saylor’s company has done this, which explains why the company’s stock (MSTR) has been trading almost as an unofficial leveraged Bitcoin ETF. As of Feb. 16, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Capital Markets Insights The correlation between Bitcoin’s and MicroStrategy’s stock prices has been remarkably strong with a 30-day correlation coefficient of 0.93 at the time of writing. Beyond MicroStrategy, an increasing number of institutions are looking into Bitcoin. Within the past year institutional heavy weights such as BlackRock, JP Morgan, BNY Mellon and Morgan Stanley have made major steps towards providing Bitcoin investing with their own and their clients’ funds. While they haven’t announced any buying activity yet, these and other corporations are likely already investing in Bitcoin. This is noticeable in Bitcoin’s transparent blockchain data. Moreover, several companies may choose to follow Tesla’s approach, buying Bitcoin privately and enjoying high returns after disclosing their purchase. IntoTheBlock’s large transactions volume indicator aggregates the total volume sent in transfers worth over $100,000. Given the magnitude of this amount, large transactions volume act as a proxy to the level of institutional activity taking place on-chain. As of Feb. 16, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin Financial metrics The growth in large transaction volume has been astounding, increasing tenfold from a daily average of $8 billion in 2017 to $80 billion so far in 2021. Bitcoin also recently recorded its first week with daily large transaction volume of over $100 billion. Alt Season Takes a Break Although Bitcoin has taken most of the headlines in crypto, other crypto-assets often referred to as altcoins have been leading the way in terms of price performance in 2021. This has been reflected in Bitcoin’s declining market dominance as well as in the price performance of top 10 cryptoassets by market capitalization. As of Feb. 16, 7PM (EST) via CoinMarketCap While several cryptoassets have more than doubled in 2021, we are observing DeFi and smart contract protocol tokens outperform in particular. This trend, though, slowed down for the most part on Feb. 16 as Bitcoin reached the $50K mark. Put in aggregate, the total market cap of altcoins is currently at all-time highs, surpassing its previous high a few days ago. As of Feb. 16 7PM (EST) via CoinMarketCap With nearly $600 billion worth of value in altcoins, it is fair to say that there is much more to crypto than just Bitcoin. While the recent milestone of $50K halted the trend in altcoins outperforming, it is yet to be seen if alt season is stepping back or if it is just getting started.

    "title": "Ethereum’s Catalysts \u0026 Contrasting Forces: A Data Perspective by IntoTheBlock",
    "detailedContent": "Every week, IntoTheBlock brings you on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. This week, we analyze Ethereum’s remarkable performance and its current state between long-term growth drivers and short-term forces weighing down. Ethereum’s Catalysts \u0026 Contrasting Forces After underperforming Bitcoin in Q4, Ether’s price has managed to grow by over 45% in the first week of January, compared to Bitcoin’s 16% increase. Having officially launched phase zero of ETH 2.0 in December, Ethereum has seen a wave of positive events unfold. While these are driving a confluence of improvements for Ethereum’s long-term potential, short-term metrics point to the recent rally being over-extended. On the institutional front, the CME announced in mid-December the launch of Ether futures set for February 2021. This would make it the only the second crypto-asset to be traded in regulated American futures exchanges, roughly four years after the first Bitcoin futures in CME. Along with this and Ether’s price growth, institutional activity in Ethereum has increased tremendously. IntoTheBlock’s Large Transactions Volume aggregates the volume transferred in transactions of over $100k, acting as a proxy to institutional activity. This metric surpassed $10 billion in daily volume for the first time since January 2018. As of Jan. 5, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Ethereum financial indicators Spikes in large transactions volume tends to coincide with periods of high volatility such as the one Ether is currently experiencing, potentially due to profit-taking. Even though the recent increase in large transactions volume may be attributed to Ether’s recent price performance, the CME Ether futures are expected to continue to drive institutional adoption for Ethereum. More recently, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) announced that banks can facilitate and issue their own stablecoins. Contrary to many of the points proposed in the Stable Act, this encourages the usage of public blockchains where stablecoins are settled, such as Ethereum. Furthermore, through the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559, Ether would be burned as a result from increased usage in stablecoins, effectively reducing its supply as transaction volume grows. These improvements are expected to act as catalysts for Ethereum’s long-term growth. In light of Ether’s recent outstanding price performance, though, derivatives and on-chain metrics have been flashing warning signs. Perpetual swaps — a type of derivatives contract that does not expire — use a mechanism known as the funding rate to artificially peg contract prices to those seen in spot markets. Whenever perpetual swaps’ prices are above spot prices, long holders of the contract pay the funding rate to short holders, typically every eight hours. As of Jan. 5, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Ethereum derivatives indicators With the recent run-up in Ether prices, funding rates hit an all-time high for exchanges such as Binance and FTX. This points to a significant premium between derivatives and spot markets, highlighting the disproportionate allocation towards Ether long positions. On-chain, we also observe potential signs of profit-taking. Particularly, inflows into centralized exchanges can often indicate holders looking to sell their positions. The reasoning behind this is that holders may have their assets in cold storage or in non-custodial wallets, where they are either unable to sell or would incur higher fees if they decide to do so there versus in centralized exchanges. Exchanges’ netflows monitor the total amount of deposits into exchanges minus withdrawals. When netflows are positive, more money is entering than leaving exchanges. Aggregate netflows for Ether reached their highest level since February 2018. As of Jan. 5, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Ethereum exchanges indicators While certainly not all deposits into centralized exchanges are due to holders looking to sell, the sudden spike coinciding with Ether’s 40% appreciation within a week does suggest at least some level of profit-taking. Overall, Ethereum is currently in a very interesting position: on the cusp of catalysts accelerating its long-term growth, but at the mercy of short-term market forces. While Ethereum’s increasing institutional adoption and approval for stablecoin usage point to positive developments, over-extended funding rates and high netflows urge caution.

    "title": "Introducing the New CoinMarketCap Crypto Price Prediction and Estimates: Methodology and Product Features",
    "detailedContent": "CoinMarketCap is introducing a new feature that enables users to provide the price predictions and estimates for their favorite crypto assets! Understanding that price predictions and estimates are key information to navigate in this market to gauge the trading sentiment of various assets, the goal of this new feature is to provide convenience by aggregating the market’s estimates in a standardized format. Users are able to view the estimate averages for any asset instead of needing to ask in various asset price discussion chat groups. Much like sell-side equity research reports in traditional financial markets, users are now able to compare the asset price performance with market expectations. Where to Find the Price Predictions \u0026 Estimates A new Price Estimates tab is added in every asset detail page (e.g. Bitcoin) — the prediction statistics for the next six month-ends are displayed when there are more than 30 submissions for each month-end. If there are less than 30 estimates submitted, the statistics will not be published due to the lack of sample size for us to perform data cleaning processes like filtering outliers and extreme values. Estimates data are also summarized in the charts to show the estimated trend and the distribution of submissions. How to Submit Estimates \u0026 Data Lock Period Users can submit their estimates in the new Price Estimates tab after they have logged in their CoinMarketCap account. Estimates submitted can be edited anytime without limit by clicking on the Edit button before the cut off date of every month, the 21 of each month for the respective month-end. For example, the last day for a user to change his/her prediction for the price of Bitcoin at the end of May would be on May 21. We have designed this data lock period so as to display statistics that reflect the market’s expectations rather than just being very close numbers from one day before. Data Processing by CoinMarketCap As the data aggregator, these are the processes we perform after users have submitted their estimates: Eligible assets: Currently, the feature is open for all assets tracked by CoinMarketCap. Minimum number of submissions for publishing statistics: Estimate statistics are published once more than 30 estimates are submitted, this is designed to ensure that the data sample size is large enough for us to perform other data cleaning processes. Outliers filtering: Currently we are using the 1.5 x IQR (interquartile range) as the main method to remove outliers, we are still testing and exploring other methods such as clustering to produce more meaningful statistics and to avoid any hostile data pollution. Extreme value filtering: We remove certain extreme values case-by-case based on the assets in question. Historical accuracy calculation: We calculate the historical estimate accuracy by comparing the volume weighted average price of the month-end date with the estimate average to provide more transparency. Potential Future Development As price prediction and estimate data are popular within communities, we hope this is only the first stage of the product and we are also planning for other features to continuously improve the data offering as well as increase the user engagement opportunities if this feature is well-received by our user community. In the future, you may see predictors’ individual profiles, leaderboard, and many more interesting features! --- We genuinely hope that you enjoy this new feature and it will bring you useful insights related to the market expectations and sentiment!

    "title": "Mirror, Mirror on the Wall: Flipside Crypto",
    "detailedContent": "Time to take a look at Mirror, a recently launched protocol from Terra that’s making big waves and attracting some serious attention. What Is Mirror? Late last year, crypto standout Terra debuted the Mirror Protocol, a new synthetic asset platform designed to help users gain access and price exposure to real-world assets. Mirror allows for the tracking, issuing and trading of these assets, such as U.S. equities like stocks, via Mirrored Assets, also known as mAssets. MAssets are synthetic derivatives of real-world assets and as the name implies, work to mirror their exchange prices on-chain. Traders outside the United States know how difficult it can be to access the stock market. And, after several controversies regarding retail trading here in the United States, even domestic traders probably don’t need a reminder of why a token such as this may pose some advantages. Mirror seeks to help both of these users by giving them the ability to participate directly in investment or speculation on price even if they don’t own the underlying asset. So far, the intended audience seems to be receptive, and Mirror is making its presence felt among traders. Liquidity has been growing steadily, reaching a high of just under 624M UST as of 5 PM on Monday, while the traded volume of Mirror reached nearly 54M UST. Why Does Mirror Matter? So, what to make of Mirror? There’s no doubt that this protocol holds major potential. That’s especially true when you consider not only the scores of international traders looking to get some stake in American companies, but also thousands of American retail traders frustrated by their experiences during the GameStop fiasco earlier this year who swore they would be looking for an alternative entry point to the stock market. Mirror may not offer a perfect solution to that problem — after all, these are synthetic derivatives and don’t provide any ownership of the stocks they represent — but like many other Terra projects, it’s designed to help bridge the gap for those looking for new ways to access traditional finance and trading options. If they’re successful, there’s a reason to believe in a big, beautiful future for Mirror and the entire Terra ecosystem. Get Involved Want to learn more about the Mirror protocol and the team behind it? Just visit the Mirror website, read the white paper, and join their community on Telegram or Discord.

    "detailedContent": "‍Smart contracts bring the best of automation and reliability of the blockchain into financial transactions and the execution of protocols, particularly in DeFi. Today, we explore the use-case of smart contracts, their risks amid exploits, and how to overcome their risks and adoption challenges. How can we approach risk on an innovation bringing the end of disputes to agreements between parties? Wouldn\u0027t the streamlined execution of an automated contract end all risks associated with unfulfilling obligations and simplify processes? Let’s take a step back and explore what smart contracts bring to the table, the underlying risks, and how to mitigate them.

Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox, along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right, millions love us!) — what are you waiting for? Smart Contracts: The Democratization of Agreements Across Sectors Smart contracts are programmable protocols that validate a series of predetermined conditions and triggers to execute such contracts issued on a verifiable and decentralized system like a blockchain. The use of “contract” as terminology comes from its automated execution based on agreements between parties but does not constitute a legally binding document. Defining this technology as a \"contract\" makes it easy to understand its use-case: programmable code that validates a series of immutable conditions agreed by parties to execute a protocol. Ethereum was the first network to envision smart contracts as the key use-case of its network, revolutionizing developers\u0027 interaction with code, application development, and deployment. The Ethereum whitepaper suggested that the financial sector would be the primary beneficiary of such innovation as a target for corruption, complexity in its steps, and the need for transparency and integrity. Since Ethereum’s launch, many other decentralized and permissionless smart contract-based protocols have emerged to serve this purpose and advance its developments (e.g., Polkadot, Tezos and EOS). However, the finance sector is not the sole beneficiary of introducing programmable contracts to tackle such inefficiencies. In the same way as digital currencies with scarcity-based models (e.g., Bitcoin) introduce the idea of programmable monetary policy, smart contracts shed light on programmable agreements for every industry. The need for transparency, fast execution and streamlined journey to comply with an agreement is an underlying common need in the arts, insurance, ownership rights, gaming, government, and many other fields. Smart contracts can simplify the development and issuance of different protocols and transactions across fields. Are the Benefits of Smart Contracts Also Their Own Source of Risk? The introduction of agreement-based protocols issued on the blockchain offers scalability, cost-efficiency, transparency, and speed to execute transactions. On top of its verifiable nature, smart contracts introduce a higher level of security while eliminating trust issues and intricacies involved in most traditional agreements. Smart contracts overcome crucial pain points from archaic processes of conducting business with the introduction of math-induced solutions, which at first glance could seem unbreakable. It can come across almost as a contradiction that blockchain\u0027s immutability could be associated with outside risks. Currently, most threats and hacks to DeFi protocols come from exploits into third-party services that protocols rely upon. For example, DeFi protocols interact with oracles, which link to centralized entities that provide off-chain data, opening space for potential exploits. Despite the perfect execution of smart contracts, its requirement to gather more data points from outside partners allows attackers to manipulate that data and conduct an attack on the DeFi protocol. Smart contracts still execute seamlessly, but their dependency on outside integrations poses one of its biggest threats for further adoption. Smart contracts’ selling points of flexibility and efficiency could be, at the same time, their biggest challenge to institutional adoption. In the same way that DeFi offers multiple avenues for users to take advantage of their yields and value propositions, hackers also rely on that flexibility to conduct attacks. For example, hackers can borrow from one protocol while swapping other tokens in a different protocol and follow this indirect chain of transactions and exploits consecutively. When it comes to integration with third-party services, DeFi protocols can work on decentralized alternatives instead of centralized oracles while increasing the KYC/AML measures to avoid its flexibility to help hackers conduct attacks. To Launch or Not to Launch? The Place of Audits Amid DeFi’s Rise DeFi’s flexibility allows for the launch of half-fledging products amid periods of high enthusiasm around digital assets. The mantra of open source projects, as with DeFi protocols, allows developers to quickly clone existing smart contracts, tweak interfaces, and launch similar protocols to draw users from projects with traction (e.g., Sushi launch based on Uniswap). To quickly launch new projects, developers overlook all the technical code audits, leaving protocols exposed to outside risks. According to CipherTrace, during 2020, DeFi protocols represent half of the attacks in the crypto space, while representing 20% of their total volume stolen. In 2019, the hacks concerning DeFi were residual, but its mainstream adoption during 2020 led to an increase in exploits. As seen, distributed ledger technologies (DLT) bring flexibility to the marketplace but do not establish formal processes or guidelines for new projects. It seems DLT’s open vision is, at the same time, a blessing and curse for proponents and users. Despite DeFi’s challenges, centralized projects still represent the majority of exploits, while decentralization could change this reality in the future with the maturity of DeFi. Nevertheless, this is not a closed problem within decentralized protocols as the main target of attacks are still centralized projects. If centralized projects are also targets of outside risks, how is DeFi different, and how can the risks be overcome? First Things First: Addressing Regulation From the Get-Go Centralized projects face outside risks even with regulatory obligations, but that should not lead decentralized projects to assume that the lack of regulatory compliance brings benefits. Instead of overlooking regulations or believing DeFi’s complexity would scare away financial compliance agencies and the government, smart contracts proponents should actively address these concerns while branching out into new applications. Looking forward, smart contracts need to find the balance between sacrificing initial exponential growth to address underlying regulatory foundations that need to be met and overcome the doubts of the most risk-averse players in the market. Nevertheless, smart contract developers have the choice to address those regulatory concerns and position themselves as prime options for institutional investors, while others can also opt for quick deployment and attract \"risk lovers.\" DeFi’s permissionless allows developers to launch new applications despite their technical risk, but users always have the freedom to choose which protocols, based on multiple criteria (including security), to use. As a result, regulators\u0027 best approach would be to protect and carefully warn users about market options while ensuring protocols to continuously work to reach an institutional-grade level of security as the sector matures. Apart from native decentralized solutions, there could be a compromise between the traditional legal landscape and smart contracts. Despite their name, smart contracts are not legal agreements between parties, but a series of predetermined steps, automatically settled by technology and verified by the blockchain. Nevertheless, integrating legally binding documents to smart contract execution could be another resource to strengthen their end-goal, mixing legal requirements with the best of decentralized technologies. Nevertheless, the priority of DeFi proponents should be to look for decentralized native solutions to tackle current challenges, differentiating themselves from incumbents. Native Solutions as the Gateway for Smart Contracts Adoption DeFi’s possible points of failure are also where the opportunities lie for smart contract upgrades and its risk mitigations. However, tackling these challenges with a centralized point of view will lead to the same issues that centralized projects face. Approaching new decentralization-based problems with old methods can yield demoralizing results. As a benchmark, developers should work within the distributed ecosystem to fix smart contract issues. Firstly, smart contract proponents shouldn’t disregard technical audits and peer-reviews of all codes as they deliver higher value propositions for users. The compromise of speed and efficiency is always present in launching these projects, but its long-term sustainability lies in its features, simplicity and security. Education is the top differentiator for users to make an educated decision on which protocols to interact with or not. Regulators can play a significant role in communicating projects\u0027 compliance and security levels, while DeFi proponents also cannot disregard their educational role in the sector’s maturity. DeFi projects have the onus, together with an expanded pool of players, to streamline and benchmark smart contract tools and best practices to ensure a common level of security across parties. Projects such as Agoric target this issue to solve it natively by developing distinct smart contract\u0027s architecture and design. Decentralization to “Bridge” Features and Compliance The role of native solutions goes further in the Know Your Customer (KYC)/Anti-Money Laundering (AML) department. On one side, protocols face money laundering risks from mal-intentioned parties taking advantage of the flexibility of decentralized technologies to conduct illegal activities while having to sacrifice those features to comply with KYC measures. On the other side, if they place those risks/responsibility on third parties to follow those regulatory principles, customers face a lack of privacy and flexibility, besides data leaking risks to centralized institutions. Fortunately, native decentralized solutions are in place to serve this need instead of relying on third-party operators to conduct and assume the compliance risk. Decentralized digital identifiers (DDIs) can overcome the counterparty risk and work as a native solution for both institutions and regulators to easily and privately verify funds’ compliance. The introduction of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) systems, where a user/institution can selectively prove credentials without revealing personal/confidential information, bolsters the integrity and assurance of the decentralized protocols while complying with regulations in a decentralized fashion. When it comes to the custody of funds, users’ privacy and reassurance of compensation under breaches, native insurance solutions take a further step. The questions of unaudited code or lack of regulatory compliance raise challenges to implement traditional insurance models. However, predetermined payouts linked to triggering events in smart contracts can help solve the insurance conundrum and provide security for crypto investors (e.g., Nexus Mutual, CDx). The issuance of products based on the smart contract’s insurance can also open a wave of secondary markets in DeFi, alluring institutions to its potential. At the end, the basis of smart contract risk mitigation is based native solutions with decentralization at its core, following clear regulations and providing security and insurance to its clients. The development and maturity of systems in place will work as signaling tools for viable, secure, and regulated projects to shape the next phase of smart contracts. Building for Within Before Branching Out for Adoption Even though the search for native solutions is key to its risk mitigations, smart contract protocols also need to broaden their integrations within the space to create a seamless and simple experience for their users amid all the regulatory and technical improvements. As a result, smart contracts adoption roadmap will have to integrate different blockchain networks under a similar interface and seamless experience. Every party needs to be completely in-sync with its steps and inner-workings of executing smart contracts as if they were working with the usual traditional alternatives. Nevertheless, the perfect execution of smart contracts should not be the be-all and end-all as it is human-written code, but its role in the market should be evaluated as a function of the next best alternative. Following that criteria, the continuous development and tweaking of smart contacts offer much safer, faster, and transparent business procedures than current options. At Outlier Ventures, we believe in the censorship resistance economy built upon new decentralized models that overcome traditional problems while creating an entirely new Web 3 ecosystem, giving power to the end-user.

Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox, along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right, millions love us!) — what are you waiting for? What Is Leverage? In finance, leverage is a strategy that relies on using borrowed money to increase the potential return of an investment. In simple terms, an investor or a trader borrows funds to amplify the exposure to a certain type of assets, projects or instruments, more so than would be possible by relying only on his own capital. Normally, with leverages, investors will be able to multiply their buying power in the market. Leverage is common in everyday life, too. When you are using a credit card to buy a TV, or when you are using mortgages to buy a house, you are borrowing money and using leverages. Leverages in Cryptoasset Trading The use of leverages is one of the most important and commonly applied features in cryptoasset trading. Shortly after the establishment of centralized exchanges, trading with leverages became more and more popular, despite the fact that the crypto market already displays high volatility. Just like in traditional finance, traders take on leverages either to simply borrow money to increase their purchasing power, or to exploit different kinds of financial derivatives, like futures and options. The leverage ratios have also been increasing from 3x, 5x to more than 100x. Higher leverages mean higher risks, but as shown by the growing volumes of leveraged trading witnessed by most CEXes, this is a danger aggressive traders are willing to undertake, in pursuit of higher returns. Leverages in DeFi Whereas the general idea of leverages is the same in both traditional and crypto finance, a major difference lies in the action of borrowing. As the only identity on the blockchain is merely a string of alphabetic codes, it would be almost impossible to borrow upon credit. In other words, DeFi borrowing is usually fully collateralized. Furthermore, other differences exist between different DeFi financial models. Leverages in DeFi Borrowing DeFi borrowing and lending is one of the earliest and the biggest DeFi applications, with giants already operating on the market, like MakerDao, Compound, AAVE, Venus, etc. The logic of taking leverage through borrowing cryptoassets is simple. For example, if you are holding $10,000 ETH and feel bullish, you can deposit your ETH in Compound as collateral and borrow $5,000 USDC, then trade for another $5,000 ETH. You will get $15,000 exposure in ETH, which is equivalent to a 1.5x leverage, compared with your initial capital of $10,000. ‍Similarly, if you are bearish, you can choose to deposit stable coins and borrow ETH. If the ETH price drops, you can buy it back at a cheaper price on the market and repay your debt. Note that in case, since you would be borrowing funds from a decentralized protocol, if the value of collaterals decreases or the value of what you borrow increases beyond a certain threshold, you might get liquidated. Leverages in Margin Trading Margin trading is a method of trading assets using funds provided by other parties. Similar to direct borrowing, it provides traders with greater sums of capital, allowing them to leverage their positions. However, there is one important difference — while the margin position is open, the trader’s assets act as collateral for the borrowed funds. DYdX is perhaps the best known decentralized margin trading platform, and allows for up to 5x leverages. In dYdX’s margin trading, traders use their own funds as a guarantee, magnify their original principal by several multiples and use these magnified funds to make larger investments. Traders need to pay an interest fee as well as the costs associated with the transaction. The position is not synthetic and it involves real borrowing and purchasing/selling. If the market moves in an unfavorable direction, a trader’s assets may not be able to fully recover the loan borrowed. To prevent this from happening, the protocol will liquidate your position before getting to a certain liquidation ratio. A closer look at how the leverage may change in margin trading — Suppose you are longing ETH 3x in margin trading, but feel reluctant to adjust the exposure from time to time. You are holding $100 USDC, borrowing another $200 USDC and trading for $300 ETH in order to take the desired ETH long position. The leverage level is $300/$100\u003d3x. If the price of ETH rises by 20%, your profit will be $300(1+20%)-$300\u003d$60. You are safer from being liquidated and the real leverage level is decreased to $360/($360-$200)\u003d2.25x. In other words, you are automatically deleveraged by the ETH price rise. If the price of ETH drops by 20%, your loss will be $300(1-20%)-$300\u003d-$60. You are in a more dangerous position as far as liquidation is concerned and the real leverage level is increased automatically to $240/($240-$200)\u003d6x. In other words, you are re-leveraged by the ETH price drops, which shows you are in a more risky position than before. Therefore, though you may assume that you are taking constant leverage by doing a fixed 3x margin trading, the real-time leverage is constantly changing. Please check here how leverage changes according to the price movement. Leverages in Perpetual Contracts Perpetual contracts are similar to traditional futures contracts, but there is no expiry. Perpetual Contracts mimic a margin-based spot market and hence trade close to the underlying reference index price. There are a number of DeFi projects providing perpetual contracts for traders, like dYdX, MCDEX, Perpetual Protocol, Injective, etc. Many traders may find it hard to tell the difference between trading on margin and perpetual contracts — indeed, they both involve users’ getting leveraged. However, there are differences in the leveraging mechanisms, fees and leverage level. For more details, see this comparison provided by dYdX. Perpetuals are a type of derivative product trading synthetic assets that are margined. The tracking of the underlying asset price happens in a synthetic way, without the need to trade the real underliers. But margin trading involves real borrowing and transactions of the actual cryptoassets. Along with perpetuals comes the concept of funding rates, which aim to keep the traded price of the perpetual contract in line with the underlying reference price. If the price of the contract is above the spot price, longs will pay shorts. In other words, traders face an ongoing cost for borrowing funds. Leverages in perpetuals are normally higher than in margin trading and can go up to 100x. The liquidation and real leverage mechanisms are the same as in margin trading. Leverages in Leveraged Tokens Leveraged tokens are derivatives giving holders leveraged exposure to cryptocurrency markets, without having to worry about actively managing a leveraged position. While they offer leveraged exposure for holders, they do not require them to work on margins, liquidation, collateral or funding rates. The biggest difference between leverages tokens and margin trading/perpetuals is that leveraged tokens will rebalance themselves periodically or when reaching a certain threshold, in order to maintain certain leverage. This is obviously different from both margin trading and perpetuals - products whose real leverages are is constantly changing according to price fluctuations, even though traders may have designated a leverage level initially. FinNexus is launching a decentralized leverage token model in Q2 2021. See the details here. Let us take a look at how the rebalancing works following the 3x ETH example above. You are holding $100 USDC and purchase an ETHBULL (3x) leveraged token. The protocol will automatically borrow $200 in USDC and trade for $200 ETH. Suppose the price of ETH increases by 20% and the ETHBULL (3x) token price rises to $300*(1+20%)-$200\u003d$160 before rebalancing. Now, your real leverage becomes 2.25 ($360/$160), lower than the targeted leverage. As part of the rebalancing process, the protocol will borrow more USD from the stablecoin pool and purchase extra ETH tokens to shift the leverage back to 3x. In our example, the protocol would borrow another $120 and exchange it for ETH. The total leverage would thus become ($360+$120)/$160\u003d3x again. Suppose the price of ETH decreases by 20%, and the ETHBULL (3x) token price decreases to $300*(1-20%)-$200\u003d$40 before rebalancing. Now, your real leverage would become six ($240/$40), higher than the targeted leverage. In this case, the protocol would sell ETH tokens and repay the outstanding debt to deleverage. In the example, the protocol would sell $120 ETH for USD and pay back to the pool. The debt would become $80 and the total leverage would once again be ($240-$120)/$40\u003d3x. In other words, the leveraged token will automatically re-leverage in profit and deleverage in loss, to restore its targeted leverage level. If the mechanism works smoothly, even in unfavorable market trends, the leveraged token holders will never be liquidated, as the deleverage mechanism will constantly lower the effective leverage level for the users. The lending pool in the leveraged token model will thus be exempted from the risk of liquidation failure and more secure than lending pools in margin trading. Leverages in Options An option is essentially a right that can be exercised in the future. In order to acquire such a right, the buyer pays a sum and the consideration is called the risk premium. For a better understanding of how options work, please refer to this guide. There are a number of platforms focusing on decentralized options as mentioned here, but this particular DeFi derivative product is still at an early stage. Options naturally produce leverages as every contract represents a unit of the underlying asset while costing only a fraction of the price. This allows options traders to control their exposures on the same number of assets but at a much lower cost. Assume you have $1000 and wish to invest in ETH. ETH is at $2000 with $2000 strike price call options traded at $100. In this case, you could use all your available funds to own 0.5 unit of ETH, or you could buy 10 call options with a strike price of $2000 — meaning you’d be exposed to the volatility of 10 ETH! In our example, with the same amount of money, you could have 20 times more exposure to ETH than you would normally be able to by just buying the asset itself. That’s how leverage works in options trading. Following the example above: ‍If the ETH price grows by 20% to $2400 and you are holding 0.5 units of ETH, your profit in USD would be $200. However, if you are holding 10 calls on ETH, by exercising the call, your profit is 10*($2400-$2000)-$1000\u003d$3000. The rate of return is $3000/$1000*100%\u003d300%. The actual leverage is 300%/20%\u003d15x. You are automatically exposed to a leveraged position by holding a call. If the ETH price grows by 10% to $2200, by exercising the call, your profit is 10*($2200-$2000)-$1000\u003d$1000. The rate of return is $1000/$1000*100%\u003d100%. The actual leverage is 100%/10%\u003d10x. If the ETH price grows by 30% to $2600, by exercising the call, your profit is 10*($2600-$2000)-1000\u003d$5000. The rate of return is $5000/$1000*100%\u003d500%. The actual leverage is 500%/30%\u003d16.67x. You may notice that the real options’ leverage is not a fixed amount — it changes according to the price of the underlying assets. Summary Leverages can bring higher gains, but also higher risks. Different financial products may have very different ways of providing leveraged exposure for traders. Especially in DeFi, leveraged products may be powered by innovative models and new liquidity solutions that are not seen in traditional finance. Before trading on leverage, users should pay attention to the models deployed and do their own extensive research.

    "detailedContent": "What Is an Initial DEX Offering (IDO)? An initial DEX offering, or IDO, is a new and exciting type of decentralized and permissionless crowdfunding platform, which is opening up a new way of fundraising in the crypto space. If a project is launching an IDO, it means the project is launching a coin or token via a decentralized liquidity exchange. This is a type of crypto asset exchange that depends on liquidity pools where traders can swap tokens, including crypto coins and stablecoins. For instance, USDT/ETH is a liquidity pair. On CoinMarketCap\u0027s ICO calendar, there is a list of upcoming, live and past projects that are fundraising. The projects are categorized based on the various stages of its fundraising – IDO, IEO, private sale, public sale and crowdloan. As of August 2021, the past few months of projects fundraising are IDOs, perhaps signalling its popularity as a fundraising method.

Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox, along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right, millions love us!) — what are you waiting for? IDO – a Better Crypto Fundraising Model? IDOs are the successor of other crypto fundraising models, including initial coin offerings (ICOs), security token offerings (STOs) and initial exchange offerings (IEOs). Offering better and immediate liquidity at every price level due to its mechanics, IDOs are an excellent choice for new projects and startups keen to launch a token and access immediate funds. Unlike the aforementioned fundraising methods, IDOs are generally considered a fair way to launch a new cryptocurrency project by avoiding pre-mines, which is an issuance system that favors project founders over community members. The first ICO was the Mastercoin ICO in July 2013. In 2014, Ethereum raised money with a token sale, raising 3,700 BTC in its first 12 hours, roughly equivalent to $2.3 million at the time. The first IEO took place on April 17, 2019, launching on the Idax, BitForex, Bit-Z and Bit-M exchanges. Whereas, in June 2019, Raven Protocol announced that it was introducing the first-ever IDO, which would be listed on Binance DEX. Raven Protocol launched the first IDO in June 2019 What Are Some Successful Projects Launched From IDOs? Despite being the first, and even claiming in their blog that they didn’t know what an IDO was as it hadn’t been done at the time, Raven Protocol is considered a successful project. Raven Protocol IDO This is a decentralized and distributed deep-learning training protocol of deep neural networks. The Raven Protocol is working at providing cost-efficient and fast solutions that use the blockchain to transform the AI and machine learning industries, which are currently dominated by major corporations. With the aid of the native RAVEN token, contributors receive rewards by sharing their computer resources while the utility token is used for AI training. Universal Market Access Protocol IDO Another successful IDO project launch, even though its IDO had initial issues, is the Universal Market Access (UMA) protocol. This enables DeFi developers to build synthetic assets on Ethereum, which are collateral-backed tokens whose value changes. Last April, it launched its token sale via decentralized exchange Uniswap with a starting price of $0.26 per token. In order to get that price, UMA had to place $535,000 in Ethereum into a newly created liquidity pool. Notably, though, because token pricing on Uniswap works with a bonding curve rather than order books, the UMA token price quickly ramped up as investors lined up to purchase the token. As a result, traders attempted to get ahead of others by paying higher gas costs, which, ultimately, led to UMA’s token price jumping more than $2 minutes after the launch. It eventually stabilized at just over $1, with some buyers complaining that they bought at a higher price than pre-sale investors. This, however, highlights the issue with Uniswap rather than UMA. Despite this initial setback, UMA currently has a market capitalization worth over $1.5 billion, with one token costing more than $25. SushiSwap IDO Another similar example is that of SushiSwap, a decentralized crypto exchange built on Ethereum, which is attempting to take the place of Uniswap as the most popular Ethereum-based decentralized exchange. Last September, SushiSwap users reportedly migrated over $1.14 billion of Uniswap’s locked crypto assets to the SushiSwap platform. Interestingly, rather than issuing an ICO for SushiSwap, the platform rewarded liquidity providers (LP) on Uniswap by staking their LP tokens on SushiSwap. For this, users were rewarded in SUSHI tokens. During SushiSwap’s first two weeks, 1,000 SUSHI tokens were issued every Ethereum block, roughly every 12 seconds, to users who staked their Uniswap LP tokens on SushiSwap’s initial protocol. Why Do We Need IDOs? When ICOs and token sales became popular in 2017, raising an estimated $4.9 billion by the end of the year, many projects were attempting to solve problems using the blockchain. While many have gone on to succeed, with far more failing, it’s hard to avoid the fact that there are several issues with ICOs: they’re centralized and vulnerable. Other notable weaknesses of ICOs include third-party discrimination, vulnerability to theft and human error and a lack of privacy. With the decentralized nature of IDOs, this new fundraising model is attempting to solve the issues of ICOs while adding new possibilities to the crypto market. By crowdfunding with IDOs, entrepreneurs can release a blockchain product that goes beyond malicious third-party influencers, while eliminating any issues regarding hackers and human error. Not only that, but token buyers and holders’ coins are instantly secured on their wallet and private keys. AtomicDEX by Komodo supports instant listings for ERC-20 and QRC-20 tokens, providing a de facto IDO platform for new crypto projects. Advantages of an IDO An initial DEX offering has many clear advantages compared to initial exchange offerings (IEO) and initial coin offerings (ICO). Let’s list a few of those here. When raising funds for a project through an IEO or ICO, projects are first required to pay exchange fees and wait for a project to receive approval by the exchange before it’s listed. With IDOs, projects don’t have to pay high fees and don’t require anyone’s permission as it’s a completely decentralized offering. Additionally, instead of waiting for an exchange to approve a project, vocal community members are the ones who vet projects and tokens, which opens the door for small projects and massive collaborations. Compared to IEOs and ICOs, which involve an initial waiting period, IDOs provide immediate access to liquidity and trading. Added to that, IDOs help streamline users by delivering a secure wallet and trading platform support that’s built into one interface. It’s also possible for IDOs to support several types of wallets, thus simplifying the user’s experience. IDOs are gaining popularity and arguably more widely used for crypto fundraising than any other model existing today. Where Are IDOs Headed in the Future? IDOs are the newest way for crypto projects to get their tokens out to the public, but just with ICOs, IEOs and STOs, improvements are still needed. This is evidenced by UMA’s IDO. With IDOs, though, a decentralized exchange means there is a lack of control mechanism. When it comes to fundraising, it’s important to have some form of control to remove token price changes or have KYC regulations, which are noted in ICOs, IEOs, and STOs. Another improvement that should be focused on is scalability. Right now, only decentralized finance (DeFi) projects have raised money through IDOs; however, that’s not to say other projects within the crypto space can’t use this form of crowdfunding. Of course, for these projects to take off, they’ll need some interest from existing DeFi users to invest in a project’s token. Why? Simply because using DeFi platforms is a learning curve, which may be a barrier to the average crypto trader. Another improvement would be to boost awareness and education of DeFi as this industry grows. The concept behind crypto is to open the doors of finance by making it decentralized. IDOs are one step to making this happen, but who’s to say if a new project is the next best thing or a rug pull waiting to happen? Consequently, it’s difficult to say if a particular coin is worth X amount. Another factor to consider is that despite the rising interest in IDOs, centralized exchanges such as Binance or Coinbase still have control over the market. Investors aren’t asking when the next IDO listing is taking place. Right now, they’re interested in when Coinbase is going to list a specific coin. Of course, this will most likely change as awareness grows around decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and DeFi in general. The future of IDOs could be bright, but more awareness is needed. Not only that, but DeFi users are only a small fraction of the overall crypto market that is still a relatively niche field, but exponentially growing in size. That being said, as of August 2021, based on CoinMarketCap ICO calendar, the past few months of projects fundraising are largely IDOs.

    "title": "Analyzing the Impact of GBTC’s Unlock \u0026 Miners’ Stabilization: A Data Perspective by IntoTheBlock",
    "detailedContent": "Every week, IntoTheBlock brings you on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. Analyzing the Impact of GBTC’s Unlock \u0026 Miners’ Stabilization During the past week, Bitcoin sustained its price around the $32K mark. The industry experienced several upcoming news that may bring volatility and speculation into the market, with the unlocking of Grayscale’s GBTC and miner activity both being closely-watched catalysts. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is an exchange-traded note that allows traditional finance investors the option to get exposure to Bitcoin without having to deal with the technical and legal obstacles that holding your own BTC implies. The fund currently holds 654,600 BTC, which has an approximate valuation of $21.47 billion. This constitutes 3.11% of the total Bitcoin supply of 21 million, making it the largest public Bitcoin holder. Recently, the news that Grayscale’s GBTC will be unlocking 40,000 Bitcoin has brought a lot of attention to the media and speculations regarding the last unlocks were drawn. Throughout this week, GBTC has been going through a process of unlocking the shares of institutional investors who subscribed directly to GBTC six months ago. This group of shares consist of all the new positions from Q1 2021. This will make it the largest ever unlock process in GBTC fund history. Notably, Ark Invest will be one of the public entities getting their GBTC unlocked, a company which earlier this month also filed to have their own Bitcoin ETF. To analyze the implications of this unlock, it is helpful to examine how GBTC has been performing relative to Bitcoin. As of July 12 via IntoTheBlock’s Capital Markets Insights Previously, individuals investing into GBTC were able to buy at a premium and they were able to capture the difference in the open market by selling their position after the unlock period. Following the Q1 2021 unlock process, the fund fell into a discount, as can be observed by the divergence starting to grow throughout February in the price performance chart above. During this July last unlock phase, possible opportunities for arbitrage trades will rise, bringing speculation and volatility into the market. Since GBTC traded at a premium six months ago, many traders were buying it and shorting BTC in spot markets to make the difference between the two. Now that these positions unwind at the unlock, it is likely that the complementary short positions will get closed, meaning that potentially the unlock would create buy pressure. On the other hand, JPMorgan sees the unlock as a risk for further downfall. They reportedly foresee investors who bought months ago as likely to take profits, leading to “downward pressure on GBTC princess and on Bitcoin markets more generally.” With valid arguments on both sides, it is worth keeping an eye out for potential volatility arising from the upcoming unlock. Another important market-driving event has been the mining migration. This has led to some challenges in the past months regarding China’s regulation enforcements and restrictions towards the mining activity ban in the country as covered in this piece. Miner Reserves measure all of the existing Bitcoin addresses that have ever minted Bitcoin and add their total balance in order to obtain their total reserve. This indicator has been affected by the mining migration. The reserve had been declining in BTC holdings throughout the last month, suggesting that miners were selling Bitcoin for cash. Throughout the last week, Bitcoin miner reserves started to increase, signalling a positive development following their significant drop in June. As of July 12 via IntoTheBlock’s mining indicators Over the past two weeks, Bitcoin miner reserves increased by 3.5%. What this could possibly mean is that the miners relocation is mostly over and that their migration expenses are already paid for. This had been a major concern since miner reserves had dropped approximately 7% from their May high, likely due to Chinese miners decreasing their holdings to fund moving expenses. In addition, an important metric which also has shown signs of relief is the hash rate. The hash rate is a measure of the aggregate computing power devoted by miners to secure the blockchain. Bitcoin’s hash rate had been in decline since the beginning of June when the China mining ban was implemented. Throughout the beginning of this month, the hash rate registered a slow but steady increase. As of July 12 via IntoTheBlock’s mining indicators As shown above, the hash rate increased from 62.03m TH/s on June 27 to a high of 115.45m TH/s on July 10, representing growth of 86%. The growth in hash rate reinforces the hypothesis that miner activity is stabilizing following their relocation phase. While the Grayscale unlock situation poses uncertainty, it is possible for its outcome to go either way. Regarding the mining events a positive trend is shown by both indicators given a possible signal that the worst is already over. There are also some relevant important upcoming news to keep in mind. Two congressmen of the country of Paraguay are looking to introduce a proposal for Bitcoin legislation and ETF’s fillings with the SEC keep piling up, currently major finance firms are in the process of being reviewed. Possibly this could be good news towards the industry. Both could continue to drive investment and adoption of it.

    "title": "HashMasks Become the Most Traded NFTs on OpenSea in a Single Week: Flipside Crypto",
    "detailedContent": "OpenSea is the largest secondary marketplace for trading crypto collectibles and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Users can sell and purchase collectibles like CryptoKitties or Crypto Punks, and even create their own marketplace to showcase new NFT collections — and as of Jan. 28, there’s a new superstar on the market. On Jan. 28, Hashmasks’s initial sale launched as a new set of digital art pieces created by more than 70 artists from across the globe. The next day, Hashmasks began appearing for resale on OpenSea. A total of 16,384 unique digital portraits exist — and that’s all that can ever be created. Each of these artworks is uniquely designed to be part digital art and part digital collectible. They are all designed to possess five basic characteristics: eye color, mask, skin color, character and an item. To add to the appeal of this project, there is also a fungible Ethereum token that you earn by owning a HashMask and can spend to change the name of your artwork. Who Made How Much? Suum Cuique Labs, from Zug, Switzerland is the project behind Hashmasks. They collected $13.4M in the six days of their initial sale. In just a week, Hashmasks were traded 2,724 times on OpenSea at an average price of $3,300. These transactions add up to a total of $8.9MM in profits that went to the NFT owners. $223,486 were collected by OpenSea in fees. Hashmask is the only project that does not have its own trading platform. Other NFTs like CryptoKitties have their own marketplace that exists outside of OpenSea. This means that unlike most NFTs, all Hashmask resales occur on secondary marketplaces and therefore the resale market fees go to the marketplaces (i.e. OpenSea) instead of the project owner (in this case Suum Cuique Labs). Comparing Hashmasks to Other NTFs on OpenSea Even looking out over the past six months, Hashmasks still come out as the most traded NFTs on OpenSea, and the most expensive to purchase. And while the total supply of Hashmasks is limited to 16K, the scarcity does not explain the high price. There are only 13K total Brave Frontier Heroes and accessories and yet they sell for an average price of $31. In second place in terms of transaction count are Brave Frontier Heroes, which were traded 836 times in the past six months. Zed Run\u0027s digital horse racing NFTs come in third, with 570 sales on OpenSea in the same timeframe. Megacryptopolis — a city builder game — has the second most expensive NFTs traded on OpenSea — averaging at $1,308 per token.

    "detailedContent": "Every week, IntoTheBlock brings you on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. Bitcoin Surpasses $40K With On-Chain Indicators Turning Bullish After a few weeks of sideways price action, it appears that Bitcoin may be showing signs that the worst has passed. Climbing from $32,000 to over $40,000 over the past seven days, Bitcoin has been propelled by positive news and key on-chain indicators pointing to significant buying activity. In terms of news, there were plenty, but Elon Musk continues to be one of the biggest influences in Bitcoin’s price. His most recent tweet about Tesla potentially accepting Bitcoin again led to a price increase of 5.5% within four hours. Source: Twitter The recent increase led to Bitcoin closing above $40,000 for the first time since May 20. Along with this growth, Bitcoin’s share of the crypto market has been increasing too. After a pronounced downtrend up to May, Bitcoin’s dominance appears to be making a reversal since the recent crash. As of June 15, 2021 via CoinMarketCap A similar pattern emerged in 2017, with Bitcoin’s dominance dropping over 40% from January to July. After a crash in July, Bitcoin recovered faster than the market, leading its dominance to climb steadily until December. Moreover, Bitcoin does tend to lead following significant corrections, as also occurred in September 2020, breaking previous all-time highs before most crypto-assets. This pattern appears to have been noticed recently by analysts from JP Morgan. “We believe that the share of bitcoin in the total crypto market would have to normalize and perhaps rise above 50% (as in 2018) to be more comfortable in arguing that the current bear market is behind us” — analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou as per a CoinDesk article. While many still await confirmation of the bottom being in, sentiment is turning bullish. Wall Street billionaire Paul Tudor Jones was quite vocal recently about his conviction in Bitcoin, signalling he wants to increase his allocation in Bitcoin to 5%. In a similar note, MicroStrategy continues to seek greater Bitcoin holdings. The publicly listed company issued $500 million worth of bonds to finance further Bitcoin acquisitions. On-chain indicators echo the buying trend among market participants. Centralized exchanges netflows point to significantly more Bitcoin being withdrawn from exchanges than deposited into them. As of June 15, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin Exchange Flows For the second time this month, over $1 billion net in Bitcoin left centralized exchanges. This typically points to large buying activity, as investors seek to hold their crypto in more secure wallets. By looking at addresses’ profitability we can confirm that Bitcoin holders took advantage of the opportunity to buy below $40,000. This is evident in the Historical In/Out of the Money, where it shows that 80% of addresses are currently “in the money”, or profiting from their holdings. As of June 15, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin Financial Indicators When comparing this to the last time Bitcoin had 80% of holders in the money, we observe that Bitcoin’s price was at $53,600. Despite the drop in price, the percentage of Bitcoin holders profiting from their position climbed back to this level, pointing to many addresses bringing their average cost down. Overall, both on-chain indicators and recent news align on a potential turning point for Bitcoin. After underperforming throughout 2021, many are looking at Bitcoin’s reversal as a leading indicator for what may come next. In that case, the high outflows in Bitcoin from centralized exchanges and high percentage of holders profiting suggest buying momentum is shifting bullish for the largest crypto-asset.

    "detailedContent": "Terra data has arrived. Now, it’s time to take a deeper dive into the ecosystem on the Flipside ecosystem with our Terra data dashboards. And we’re getting some help from Joan Kallogieri and our official Terra ambassador, @mike_platis. Terra’s Suite of Stablecoins For those that are not familiar, Terra consists of a group of stablecoins that mirror the value of real-world fiat currencies. Many different use cases are in the works for these currencies. In fact, as Joan points out, Terra is designed to allow you to earn interest on stablecoins, spend crypto easily with merchants, and replace most of your banking needs with one seamless DeFi protocol. Activity Picks Up for New Terra Wallets We’ll start our analysis by taking a look at the daily transaction numbers for different wallet types on Terra. As we can see in the graph below, larger wallets (defined as those holding more than $100K in value) and smaller wallets (everyone else) alike seem to be pulling their weight equality. According to Joan, this could indicate that Terra usage is diversified by both whales and smaller players. Legend: Green — smaller wallets; Gray — larger wallets When we compare new and old wallets, meanwhile, older accounts have mostly dominated usage. When we look at the last few days, however, we can see an increase in usage from newer accounts, which could signal that new users are becoming more active. Legend: Green — older wallets; Gray — newer wallets Staking Spikes During Bull Run Next up is a look at the viability of Validators during the recent LUNA price drop. As @mike_platis reminds us, LUNA holders do not stake their tokens directly. Instead, they delegate their Luna to a validator, giving a wider range of LUNA holders access to rewards. When we examine staking activities, as can be seen below, there’s a surprise. The raw volume of staking spiked during the peak of the bull-run in mid-March, rather than during the recent price drop. “The three highest volume days of total delegations were followed by the three worst drops percentage-wise in LUNA\u0027s price” @mike_platis noted. “It seemed as if delegators anticipated the correction of their over-extended asset.” Legend: Green — delegations; Red — undelegations Also interestingly, staking supply has continually grown in recent months, regardless of the price of LUNA itself. Even immediately after the drop in price, @mike_platis, points, activity continued to increase, showing users’ confidence in the overall ecosystem. “Terra passed this stress test relatively well,” @mike_platis noted. “Convicted holders became buyers and immediately put their LUNA to work by staking it. This shows a real demand for LUNA as collateral and as a productive asset. LUNA is positioned as a value capture for all activity within the ecosystem.” Legend: Green — average price; Gray — staked supply Those who did remain in the network saw a decreasing tax rate. That can be expected to continue, @mike_platis said, as staking activity and transactions each continue to increase over time. Learn More Want to learn more about the Terra ecosystem?

    "title": "Tesla, Dogecoin \u0026 Institutional Interest: A Data Perspective by IntoTheBlock",
    "detailedContent": "Every week, IntoTheBlock brings you on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. This week we analyze the impact Tesla and Elon Musk have had on crypto. Particularly, we dive into data comparing the types of players getting involved with Bitcoin vs. Dogecoin and what may come next. Tesla Renews Institutional Interest in Bitcoin Tesla has caused major ripples throughout the crypto after disclosing it bought $1.5 billion in Bitcoin and plans to accept crypto as payments. The announcement comes a few days after Elon Musk changed his Twitter bio simply to “Bitcoin.” Elon Musk has since deleted the bio, but announced something much larger. Tesla joins the likes of Square and MicroStrategy as public companies owning Bitcoin on their balance sheet. With the addition of Tesla’s investment, this would mean over $6 billion in Bitcoin is held by publicly traded corporations as per Bitcoin Treasuries. The electric vehicle company is now the second largest publicly-traded corporation holding Bitcoin, second only to MicroStrategy. In comparison to Michael Saylor’s company, though, Tesla’s stock had already accrued remarkable growth prior to investing in Bitcoin. As of Feb. 10, 2021 through IntoTheBlock’s free capital markets insights Bitcoin has slightly underperformed Tesla over the last year, though the gap between the two has been narrowing. Additionally, while the two appeared to move in tandem in early January, their correlation coefficient has dropped to only 0.07, implying little to no statistical relationship between the two in the past 30 days. However, this is likely to increase following Tesla’s investment of 8% of its cash available in Bitcoin. While institutional adoption has already been a recurring narrative for Bitcoin in 2020 and 2021, Tesla may be kicking off interest amongst a broader category of large corporations. On-chain data suggests that this widespread institutional interest may have already begun. As of Feb. 10, 2021 through IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin financial metrics The average transaction size recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain had just hit a record the day Tesla announced their investment, just to be shattered by next day’s whopping $440,000 average transaction. The high magnitude of six-figure transactions point to institutional activity in Bitcoin reaching new highs. Needless to say, the market has taken much more positively Tesla’s actions over Elon’s bio update. Not only did Bitcoin hit new highs on the day of Tesla’s disclosure, but exchange activity pointed to low impact on sellers. Typically as the price of a cryptoasset increases, so do exchange deposits as investors look to take profits. Net Flows — which subtract exchange deposits (inflows) minus withdrawals (outflows) — hit a yearly high following Elon Musk’s update. On the day of Tesla’s announcement, though, net flows barely increased, potentially signalling that this move could be more indicative of a point of inflection than a selling opportunity. As of Feb. 10, 2021 through IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin exchange metrics Now onto Elon Musk’s other favorite cryptocurrency. Doge Wows Investors Source: Twitter From Elon Musk to Kiss’s bassist Gene Simmons to Snoop Dogg to Mia Khalifa… Dogecoin has grown virally. The meme cryptocurrency started as a joke has managed to reach a market capitalization of over $10 billion. While Elon Musk recently admitted his comments on Dogecoin are “mostly a joke,” the market may be taking the currency more seriously than he does. Sparked by celebrity (unofficial) endorsements, retail interest in the meme cryptocurrency has spiked massively. Source: CoinMarketCap Having increased approximately 90x from its March bottom, it is fair to say that Dogecoin has gone parabolic. Note that this is the case even with the logarithmic scale on the chart above. Along with the remarkable appreciation, Dogecoin speculation has certainly followed. This is evidenced by the number of addresses that have been holding Doge for under 30 days — categorized as traders by IntoTheBlock. Source: IntoTheBlock Within the last month the number of traders in Dogecoin has reached new highs, increasing over 30% in the last month alone. At the same time, the total volume belonging to traders has decreased by 3%, indicating that high volume traders may no longer be holding. Instead, it is mostly retail traders taking part in the recent surge in Dogecoin. Despite managing to increase dramatically, Dogecoin’s average holder has less than $3,000 worth of Doge. Source: IntoTheBlock For comparison, Bitcoin’s average balance is approximately $24,000. This further displays the retail-driven mania markets have been experiencing. Following Gamestop’s quick boom and bust, investors are advised to proceed with caution as meme assets favored by retail investors have demonstrated to be volatile and highly speculative. While there certainly still is retail participation in Bitcoin, Bitcoin’s investment from large corporations such as Tesla may be much more telling than all the Dogecoin tweets together. Despite Elon Musk’s interest in both, on-chain data suggests demand for Bitcoin is stemming from much larger players than Dogecoin’s.

    "detailedContent": "CoinMarketCap Q2 Recap Crypto investors might feel that they were riding a roller coaster in Q2 2021 😅. In mid-April, Bitcoin hit an all-time high in price, Ethereum then caught up in May and the total market cap also reached its ATH on the same day. However, everything has cooled down again in the second half of the quarter and BTC is now down to the lowest price since this bull run began. There has also been a new meme coin heat wave, with tokens being named after all sorts of dog breeds and animals receiving attention from investors. While the crypto market experienced ATH craziness and investors and laypeople alike began chasing these little meme cuties around, the CoinMarketCap team has also been crazily busy in providing you with a better experience and more useful tools. Have you noticed all the enhancements we’ve done? Let’s have a look! Subscribe Join us in showcasing the cryptocurrency revolution, one newsletter at a time. Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox, along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right, millions love us!) — what are you waiting for? The CoinMarketCap Website We made some bold moves in Q2 2021 by creating more projects to showcase the ongoing mass adoption of cryptocurrency. Prior to Q2, we had built up some basic foundations for the site, and now it was time for us to go deeper and wider. CoinMarketCap\u0027s homepage as of July 15, 2021 — remember this for posterity! We’ve accomplished a few important milestones, including: 1. NFT listing page: The NFT mania started in Q1 2021, and although we have NFT-related token listings already on CoinMarketCap, it\u0027s also very important to display NFT asset rankings so that you can have a brief idea of the entire NFT landscape. 2. Project event calendar: While you are researching investment opportunities, having a centralized place for catching up with all major events from projects is essential. Maybe you want to join AMAs to learn more about a project, or to know in advance what’s going to happen for projects you care about — all these facets are important to follow and watch out for in the crypto space. 3. ICO calendar and the ICO information: ICOs (initial coin offering) or IDOs (initial DEX offering) are significant in getting the first-mover adventage for crypto investors. With more information displayed for a project and their initial offering, all the data and information presented can be a major source of important information. We also added some useful information like token distribution schedule and % allocated (for limited projects), holders’ information and the rich list of a project. All in all, we want you to make better decisions from the different data sets we provide. 4. Fiat vs crypto ranking and company vs crypto ranking: Have you ever wondered how crypto can be compared with fiat currencies or the biggest companies in the world? The new rankings provide you an interesting comparison for different kinds of assets, and might also help you to make some investment decisions! 5. Price estimation: There have been all kinds of different methods for estimating the price of cryptocurrencies, but none of them are 100% accurate and it’s usually hard to understand the algorithm behind these numbers. Instead of us scratching our heads to figure out the methodology, we think all of our users have more intelligence than us, and with the power of crowdsourced knowledge we might be able to make a good prediction of how the crypto trends will go. 6. Airdrop calendar and airdrop campaigns: An airdrop is a unique activity happening frequently in the crypto world. As we have been in contact with thousands of projects, and millions of users, we thought it would be cool if we could bridge the gap between projects and users, and provide a platform for our users to access all these benefits much easier. 7. Heatmap: We know that lots of our users are very busy and only have limited time to glance at the market most of the time. Our coin rankings are good, but not something instinctively easy to get a sense of price moves. Our new heatmap is prepared for this kind of user who can easily judge the market from the red/ green on the graphic! We know it’s hard to see the screen all in red but it indeed feels good when the heatmap is all green for some good days! 8. Portfolio enhancement: You asked and we listened! Ever since we released our portfolio feature, lots of users have given us feedback that they want to have more advanced features available. One of them is the ability to host multiple portfolios on CoinMarketCap! We made it happen for you! Now with a few clicks, you can have different portfolios for various purposes. 9. Token swap: To connect the dots in crypto adoption, one very important factor is the easiness of fund movements. We started by providing you the ability to connect to your wallets and make swaps on Uniswap and PancakeSwap, but stay tuned, this is just a start of everything and more will be coming! 10. Loyalty program - CoinMarketCap Diamonds: We also know that we have a large group of users who like us and grow with us. No matter if you have been with us for a long time, or you are new here, we are always grateful and want to thank you for accompanying us. From now on when you come to our site, don’t forget to collect diamonds and in the very near future, there will be some exciting rewards you can exchange your diamonds with. 11, Guess which country will make crypto a legal tender next: El Salvador just recently passed the law to recognize Bitcoin as legal tender — the first country in the world to do so. We are all very excited about this news and we believe there could be more countries following El Salvador. We want to know more about how you think and made a small guessing tournament for it! Come join us to predict and chances to win more diamonds too!! Apart from these new features, we are also aiming to provide more stable and reliable services across our different products. To prepare for this, we’ve invested a huge amount of resources in rewriting the APIs/ engines behind the scenes, and gradually replacing the old ones with higher performance APIs all around the site.

    "title": "TI Weekly Research - Great Delivery Day",
    "detailedContent": "June 25 is a special day in the crypto asset market. Usually, every Friday marks the peak delivery of derivatives, with price fluctuation to a certain extent. On June 25, the futures and options expiry dates will encompass the following: The current week The following week June July 2021 Q1 next quarter And 2021 Q2 current quarter Additionally, a large number of institutions will carry out options allocations around this day. At a time when the market appears to be sluggish after a series of blows, the movements of institutional and professional investors have become increasingly important indicators. This information may yield certain \"clues” about the market trend in the second half of 2021. Recent transactions of BTC options, source: metrics.deribit.comBefore and after delivery: trading volume rises under the supervision‍ Around June 25, derivatives information caused the prices of mainstream crypto assets to fluctuate sharply, adding to an already volatile market. Due to strict regulations and more bearish news, Bitcoin’s price once fell to around $29,000, while the weekly spot trading volume rose to $82.19 billion compared to last week. This all occurred amidst the selling pressure of shorts and moves from whale investors. Bitcoin price changes in the past seven days, as of 5:00 am on June 25. Source: tokeninsight.com Short-term speculative sentiment has also risen. Bitcoin\u0027s historical volatility has increased to more than 100 after a month or so of decline. Another indicator shows the weekly volume of perpetual contracts reaching $622.8 billion, pointing to a recurring rise in speculative sentiment. Changes in the volatility of Bitcoin index prices and perpetual contract prices, as of 5:00 am on June 25. Source: gvol.io A similar situation can be seen with Ethereum. After three months, the price of Ethereum once again returned to a level below $2,000, while weekly trading volume reached $50.78 billion due to selling pressure. It experienced an increase of 35.52% compared to last week, and contract trading reached $209.6 billion (increasing 43.76% compared to the previous week). Ethereum price changes in the past 90 days, as of 5:00 am on June 25. Source: tokeninsight.com In both the perpetual contract market and options market this week, there were many short-term large-value options trades. On June 21, large-value traders purchased a significant number of short-term Bitcoin put options on Deribit, with strike prices ranging from $28,000 to $34,000. In the Ethereum market, traders also purchased short-term large-value put options on the same day, with strike price of $2400 and face value of 300 ETH. Judging from the recent price trend, it is undoubtedly a small profit. The large transaction of Bitcoin options on Deribit on June 21. Source: gvol.io The large trading volume of Ethereum options on Deribit on June 21. Source: gvol.io According to data from Deribit, a total of $4 billion in options contracts expired on Friday. Among them, BTC was $2.56 billion, and ETH was $1.42 billion. These were lower than the amounts on the \"Great Delivery Day\" in Q1 (March 26) and the month-end delivery date on April 30. However, the importance of this delivery day is even greater than that of the previous two. The reason being that this options delivery contains the contracts of the current week, next week, current month, next month, 2021 Q2 current quarter, 2021 Q1 next quarter. At the same time, the next cycle of options and futures allocation will be carried out before and after this delivery, which is why this delivery day is worth studying. The current options and futures data indeed seem to have shown some clues about the market’s future development.

Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox, along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right, millions love us!) — what are you waiting for? What\u0027s Next For Bitcoin? Let’s ignore the turbulent macro information. We already know that inflation reduction and interest rate hikes have nine months remaining before their impact is fully revealed. The Whales\u0027 movements in the second half of 2021 may play a more important role. From their movements, we can get a glimpse of some pressing information: Bitcoin options transactions in the past 30 days. Source: gvol.io On June 22, there was a large Bitcoin transaction of close to 7,000 contracts. Based on the date, it is undoubtedly from institutional or professional investors. So, what did they do during this time? Bitcoin options trading on June 22. Source: gvol.io Pay attention to the two largest transactions. One is the purchase of a $20,000 call option that expires on June 25, and the other is the sale of a put option that expires on March 25 of the following year with a strike price of $25,000. At that time, the price of Bitcoin was around $32,000. It means that some whales believe that the price of Bitcoin will not be less than $25,000 in this six-month period and that it will not be less than $32,000 after a short-term correction. The movement of the other whale is more worthy of attention: he sold 1,200 call options contracts with the strike price of $64,000, and bought 800 call option contracts with the strike price of $70,000. The execution times were respectively December 31 and March 25 of the following year. The price of deep out-of-the-money options is relatively low, and the operation of deep out-of-the-money options can indicate the whale’s prediction of the market. First, he believes that the price of Bitcoin will not exceed $64,000 at the end of the year, so he chooses to sell options to obtain a premium. As for buying $70,000 of options, it may be to hedge the possible price increase risk. What\u0027s Next For Ethereum? Ethereum\u0027s trends are mostly concentrated in the short term. It is worth noting the operation on June 18: Some large-value transactions of Ethereum options on June 18. Source: gvol.io On the same day, 6,500 put options expire on July 30 with a strike price of $1,600 traded. Meanwhile, the transaction records of large call options were mostly centered on the quarterly contracts that expire on September, 24 and the strike price was around $2000-2500. Professional investors do not seem to be optimistic about the short-term performance of Ethereum. But they are more confident about performance in the long term. The skewness also shows a similar situation: Ethereum forward options have been incorporating optimism into their pricing. The performance of Ethereum options skewness. Source: gvol.io Judging from the operations of the whales, we may be facing a more turbulent market in July. The big investors\u0027 bearishness on Ethereum seems to be due to their concerns and bets about the upcoming London upgrade. On the other hand, the limited optimism for Bitcoin is only long-term, and the recent low volatility of Bitcoin’s price will continue. The volatility skewness turned negative in recent days, indicating that the whales have re-adjusted their market expectations for mainstream crypto assets. In all, the apparent premium of the month-to-month Bitcoin and Ethereum futures seems to herald the market\u0027s mid-third quarter revival after the turmoil.

    "title": "The Flipside Stablecoin Recipe for Success",
    "detailedContent": "What are the on-chain metrics that matter most for the success of stablecoins? In this report, we focus on USDC specifically, and look at its DeFi activity and health in comparison to three other leading stablecoins (USDT, DAI and PAX). All data visuals were created using Velocity, which is public and free for anyone to create queries. Access velocity: https://app.flipsidecrypto.com/auth/signup What Metrics Really Matter for Stablecoins? There are a few important facets to consider when evaluating the health of stablecoins on Ethereum. Here is our take: Liquidity Is there enough to manage demand? How is it broken out at a high level? Supply Is it active and healthy? Who is using the top stablecoins, where, and how many protocols support them? Peg How reliable is the peg? Transaction Fees How much are users paying to use the stablecoin? ‍ Total Value Locked in DeFi How much stablecoin supply is staked in known DeFi protocols? An important ingredient in the picture of stablecoin health: the more stablecoins are used in more protocols, the higher this number will grow over time. Access to CSV and API endpoints for this data: https://velocity-app.flipsidecrypto.com/shareable/tvl-ZxRPeY Volume, Active Addresses and Transaction Counts We break out these three fundamental metrics for on-chain activity into three buckets: DeFi + DEX; CEX; and Other, to observe overall growth in use of stablecoins and to see which categories are spurring that growth. Access to CSV and API endpoints for this data: https://velocity-app.flipsidecrypto.com/shareable/triumvirate-bWzSFF Liquidity and Number of Holders To track the number of active users, we observe both the liquidity they control, as well as the number of addresses that control it. In general, the more liquidity controlled by the more users (addresses) the better. We also break this metric out by DeFi + DEX; DEX; and Other for added information. Access to CSV and API endpoints for this data: https://velocity-app.flipsidecrypto.com/shareable/liquidity-SzIz2w Developer Preference/Support Stablecoins used by more protocols are more likely to be foundational parts of the space’s rapid expansion. We count the number of projects, including DeFi protocols, Decentralized Exchanges, dApps, and Centralized exchanges that support or rely on stablecoins for their operation. This is an indicator of developer preference and it is clear from this metric that USDC, DAI, and USDT are the default choices. Access to CSV and API endpoints for this data: https://velocity-app.flipsidecrypto.com/shareable/protocols-ZGNEe8 How Reliable Is the Peg to the US Dollar for USDC? We use CoinMarketCap’s price ticks bucketed by day to show variance in peg. This is a fundamentally important metric that underpins each stablecoin’s perceived legitimacy and reliability to the user community. Access to CSV and API endpoints for this data: https://velocity-app.flipsidecrypto.com/shareable/variance-KCfD9K How Much Users Pay to Transact Fees paid for stablecoin transactions over the last nine months underpin the choice by users to pay in some cases significant sums to send, stake, and otherwise use stablecoins by category.

    "title": "On-Chain Analysis of the May 2021 FUD: A Data Perspective by IntoTheBlock",
    "detailedContent": "Every week, IntoTheBlock brings you on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. On-Chain Analysis of the May 2021 FUD Crypto markets endured a significant correction throughout the last week for the most part. In a week loaded with negative news, which we’ll get into shortly, prices in Bitcoin and Ether dropped double digits. The exception to this trend has been DeFi tokens, with most of them managing to rise regardless. As of May 18, 2021 through IntoTheBlock’s Capital Markets Insights As can be seen above, Bitcoin and Ether holders incurred a 21% and 16% loss over the past seven days, at least on paper (this piece was written before Bitcoin\u0027s correction to below $33,000). The bearish trend comes after strong rallies in both crypto-assets with Bitcoin and Ether having reached a 124% and 491% return respectively prior to the recent correction. Many point to several negative news emerging throughout the past week as the catalyst for the recent FUD—that is fear, uncertainty and doubt, for those uninitiated in crypto parlance. Recapping the recent FUD, one of the biggest culprits is someone who might have been framed as a hero within crypto not too long ago. I’m talking of course about Elon Musk, whose influence in Twitter is as apparent as ever. The saga begun as Elon tweeted the following statement about Tesla no longer accepting Bitcoin payments: Source: Twitter The statement was a complete u-turn from beginning to accept Bitcoin payments just over a month ago. Bitcoin dropped as much as 15% within three hours after the tweet. Following the announcement, thousands (millions?) of Twitter accounts messaged Elon Musk eager to have him change his mind. While he engaged in multiple occasions, his frustration grew noticeable, leading up to to the following one-word reply: Source: Twitter The tweet resulted in another drawdown—this time of 7%—within the following three hours. Though the tweet hinted that Tesla had sold their Bitcoin position, a day later he clarified that was not the case. On top of the FUD caused by Elon’s tweets over the past week, there have also been other news exacerbating the downtrend. For instance, an article on Bloomberg brought to light an investigation from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) into Binance, which may have spooked some investors although Binance is said to be collaborating with law enforcement on this. Finally, Reuters reiterated the message from Chinese officials banning institutions from participating in cryptocurrency activity, though not individuals. While this may initially appear to be new regulation from the Chinese government, in reality they are simply repeating and clarifying the measures they had already imposed in 2013 and 2017, according to a CoinDesk piece. The impact of this news was felt in Bitcoin’s on-chain activity. For one, exchange inflows—which track the total amount deposited into centralized cryptocurrency exchanges—reached its highest level in three months. As of May 18, 2021 through IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin Exchange Flows With over 85K Bitcoin (nearly $3.8 billion USD) transferred into centralized exchanges, Bitcoin’s exchange inflow volume has grown 270% relative to 30 days ago. Bitcoin inflows also hit levels above 70K BTC on May 12 and May 13, when Elon’s “Tesla and Bitcoin” tweet and the Binance investigation occurred. Though not all of the inflows here can be directly tied to these events, it is clear that Elon Musk and the slew of bad news impacted the market. Therefore, it is likely that a significant portion of these inflows came from users depositing their Bitcoin into centralized exchanges looking to sell. Despite the deep sell-off, not all indicators are pointing to negative patterns. To the contrary, on-chain ownership indicators show that Bitcoin supply is consolidating among larger holders, as evidenced by the growth in an address’s average balance. As of May 18, 2021 through IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin financial indicators After falling consistently throughout the first quarter of the year, the average balance of Bitcoin addresses has begun to increase. The trend changed shortly after Bitcoin hit $60,000 and continues to accelerate despite — or likely because of — the recent correction. This pattern suggests that selling off from large players has slowed down and buying activity has accelerated. It also points to the likelihood of smaller players potentially selling their positions due the recent FUD. Overall, crypto markets endured an eventful week with Elon Musk and various news flooding with short-term negativity. While this led to a wave of exchange inflows and selling activity, it is likely that the trend may reverse as buying activity from large players picks up as evidenced by the increasing average Bitcoin address balance.

    "detailedContent": "Since January, the shocks in the crypto market do not show any sign of stopping. Bitcoin has experienced many call-backs (between $40,000 and $30,000) after breaking $30,000 at the beginning of January. Other assets show strong correlations with Bitcoins, which reflects the market sentiments correspondingly. The good news is some indicators show positive signals of the near future market. ‘From Peak to Trough’ After the price of Bitcoin called-back to $39,000 last week, it stabilized around $36,000. However, the peace time was relatively short: Since Jan. 20, Bitcoin dropped to $29,112 on Coinbase at 0:30 UTC on Thursday, a level last reached on Jan. 4 when the leading cryptocurrency started rallying hard to an all-time high of just below $42,000 on Jan. 8. BTC price in the last 30 days, chart from 9pm EST, Jan 21. Source: tokeninsight.com At press time, the price of Bitcoin has stepped back to $30,000, down about 15% over the last 24 hours. The impact is obvious — except for a few “Blue Chips” like DOT, ETH and stablecoins — lending protocols tokens are following Bitcoin’s step and dropping significantly, about 10% down within 24 hours, especially for BNB and COMP, which saw decreases of about 20%.

In the huge fluctuations, DOT has been holding on for a week: and this week, DOT bucked the trend again. Although the price did not increase significantly, the weekly trading volume increased by 110.76% compared to last week, and broke through $10B, which makes a new record. As public chains other than BTC and ETH, Polkadot and Ripple have been competing for the third position of cryptos for a long time. With the gradual improvement of the Polkadot ecology and Ripple\u0027s regulatory turmoil, it seems that we have a winner. The outstanding performance of DOT in crazy January proves that a new consensus about “the third public chain” has been formed in the crypto market.

    "detailedContent": "‍Smart contracts bring the best of automation and reliability of the blockchain into financial transactions and the execution of protocols, particularly in DeFi. Today, we explore the use-case of smart contracts, their risks amid exploits, and how to overcome their risks and adoption challenges. How can we approach risk on an innovation bringing the end of disputes to agreements between parties? Wouldn\u0027t the streamlined execution of an automated contract end all risks associated with unfulfilling obligations and simplify processes? Let’s take a step back and explore what smart contracts bring to the table, the underlying risks, and how to mitigate them. Subscribe Join us in showcasing the cryptocurrency revolution, one newsletter at a time. Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox, along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right, millions love us!) — what are you waiting for? Smart Contracts: The Democratization of Agreements Across Sectors Smart contracts are programmable protocols that validate a series of predetermined conditions and triggers to execute such contracts issued on a verifiable and decentralized system like a blockchain. The use of “contract” as terminology comes from its automated execution based on agreements between parties but does not constitute a legally binding document. Defining this technology as a \"contract\" makes it easy to understand its use-case: programmable code that validates a series of immutable conditions agreed by parties to execute a protocol. Ethereum was the first network to envision smart contracts as the key use-case of its network, revolutionizing developers\u0027 interaction with code, application development, and deployment. The Ethereum whitepaper suggested that the financial sector would be the primary beneficiary of such innovation as a target for corruption, complexity in its steps, and the need for transparency and integrity. Since Ethereum’s launch, many other decentralized and permissionless smart contract-based protocols have emerged to serve this purpose and advance its developments (e.g., Polkadot, Tezos and EOS). However, the finance sector is not the sole beneficiary of introducing programmable contracts to tackle such inefficiencies. In the same way as digital currencies with scarcity-based models (e.g., Bitcoin) introduce the idea of programmable monetary policy, smart contracts shed light on programmable agreements for every industry. The need for transparency, fast execution and streamlined journey to comply with an agreement is an underlying common need in the arts, insurance, ownership rights, gaming, government, and many other fields. Smart contracts can simplify the development and issuance of different protocols and transactions across fields. Are the Benefits of Smart Contracts Also Their Own Source of Risk? The introduction of agreement-based protocols issued on the blockchain offers scalability, cost-efficiency, transparency, and speed to execute transactions. On top of its verifiable nature, smart contracts introduce a higher level of security while eliminating trust issues and intricacies involved in most traditional agreements. Smart contracts overcome crucial pain points from archaic processes of conducting business with the introduction of math-induced solutions, which at first glance could seem unbreakable. It can come across almost as a contradiction that blockchain\u0027s immutability could be associated with outside risks. Currently, most threats and hacks to DeFi protocols come from exploits into third-party services that protocols rely upon. For example, DeFi protocols interact with oracles, which link to centralized entities that provide off-chain data, opening space for potential exploits. Despite the perfect execution of smart contracts, its requirement to gather more data points from outside partners allows attackers to manipulate that data and conduct an attack on the DeFi protocol. Smart contracts still execute seamlessly, but their dependency on outside integrations poses one of its biggest threats for further adoption. Smart contracts’ selling points of flexibility and efficiency could be, at the same time, their biggest challenge to institutional adoption. In the same way that DeFi offers multiple avenues for users to take advantage of their yields and value propositions, hackers also rely on that flexibility to conduct attacks. For example, hackers can borrow from one protocol while swapping other tokens in a different protocol and follow this indirect chain of transactions and exploits consecutively. When it comes to integration with third-party services, DeFi protocols can work on decentralized alternatives instead of centralized oracles while increasing the KYC/AML measures to avoid its flexibility to help hackers conduct attacks. To Launch or Not to Launch? The Place of Audits Amid DeFi’s Rise DeFi’s flexibility allows for the launch of half-fledging products amid periods of high enthusiasm around digital assets. The mantra of open source projects, as with DeFi protocols, allows developers to quickly clone existing smart contracts, tweak interfaces, and launch similar protocols to draw users from projects with traction (e.g., Sushi launch based on Uniswap). To quickly launch new projects, developers overlook all the technical code audits, leaving protocols exposed to outside risks. According to CipherTrace, during 2020, DeFi protocols represent half of the attacks in the crypto space, while representing 20% of their total volume stolen. In 2019, the hacks concerning DeFi were residual, but its mainstream adoption during 2020 led to an increase in exploits. As seen, distributed ledger technologies (DLT) bring flexibility to the marketplace but do not establish formal processes or guidelines for new projects. It seems DLT’s open vision is, at the same time, a blessing and curse for proponents and users. Despite DeFi’s challenges, centralized projects still represent the majority of exploits, while decentralization could change this reality in the future with the maturity of DeFi. Nevertheless, this is not a closed problem within decentralized protocols as the main target of attacks are still centralized projects. If centralized projects are also targets of outside risks, how is DeFi different, and how can the risks be overcome? First Things First: Addressing Regulation From the Get-Go Centralized projects face outside risks even with regulatory obligations, but that should not lead decentralized projects to assume that the lack of regulatory compliance brings benefits. Instead of overlooking regulations or believing DeFi’s complexity would scare away financial compliance agencies and the government, smart contracts proponents should actively address these concerns while branching out into new applications. Looking forward, smart contracts need to find the balance between sacrificing initial exponential growth to address underlying regulatory foundations that need to be met and overcome the doubts of the most risk-averse players in the market. Nevertheless, smart contract developers have the choice to address those regulatory concerns and position themselves as prime options for institutional investors, while others can also opt for quick deployment and attract \"risk lovers.\" DeFi’s permissionless allows developers to launch new applications despite their technical risk, but users always have the freedom to choose which protocols, based on multiple criteria (including security), to use. As a result, regulators\u0027 best approach would be to protect and carefully warn users about market options while ensuring protocols to continuously work to reach an institutional-grade level of security as the sector matures. Apart from native decentralized solutions, there could be a compromise between the traditional legal landscape and smart contracts. Despite their name, smart contracts are not legal agreements between parties, but a series of predetermined steps, automatically settled by technology and verified by the blockchain. Nevertheless, integrating legally binding documents to smart contract execution could be another resource to strengthen their end-goal, mixing legal requirements with the best of decentralized technologies. Nevertheless, the priority of DeFi proponents should be to look for decentralized native solutions to tackle current challenges, differentiating themselves from incumbents. Native Solutions as the Gateway for Smart Contracts Adoption DeFi’s possible points of failure are also where the opportunities lie for smart contract upgrades and its risk mitigations. However, tackling these challenges with a centralized point of view will lead to the same issues that centralized projects face. Approaching new decentralization-based problems with old methods can yield demoralizing results. As a benchmark, developers should work within the distributed ecosystem to fix smart contract issues. Firstly, smart contract proponents shouldn’t disregard technical audits and peer-reviews of all codes as they deliver higher value propositions for users. The compromise of speed and efficiency is always present in launching these projects, but its long-term sustainability lies in its features, simplicity and security. Education is the top differentiator for users to make an educated decision on which protocols to interact with or not. Regulators can play a significant role in communicating projects\u0027 compliance and security levels, while DeFi proponents also cannot disregard their educational role in the sector’s maturity. DeFi projects have the onus, together with an expanded pool of players, to streamline and benchmark smart contract tools and best practices to ensure a common level of security across parties. Projects such as Agoric target this issue to solve it natively by developing distinct smart contract\u0027s architecture and design. Decentralization to “Bridge” Features and Compliance The role of native solutions goes further in the Know Your Customer (KYC)/Anti-Money Laundering (AML) department. On one side, protocols face money laundering risks from mal-intentioned parties taking advantage of the flexibility of decentralized technologies to conduct illegal activities while having to sacrifice those features to comply with KYC measures. On the other side, if they place those risks/responsibility on third parties to follow those regulatory principles, customers face a lack of privacy and flexibility, besides data leaking risks to centralized institutions. Fortunately, native decentralized solutions are in place to serve this need instead of relying on third-party operators to conduct and assume the compliance risk. Decentralized digital identifiers (DDIs) can overcome the counterparty risk and work as a native solution for both institutions and regulators to easily and privately verify funds’ compliance. The introduction of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) systems, where a user/institution can selectively prove credentials without revealing personal/confidential information, bolsters the integrity and assurance of the decentralized protocols while complying with regulations in a decentralized fashion. When it comes to the custody of funds, users’ privacy and reassurance of compensation under breaches, native insurance solutions take a further step. The questions of unaudited code or lack of regulatory compliance raise challenges to implement traditional insurance models. However, predetermined payouts linked to triggering events in smart contracts can help solve the insurance conundrum and provide security for crypto investors (e.g., Nexus Mutual, CDx). The issuance of products based on the smart contract’s insurance can also open a wave of secondary markets in DeFi, alluring institutions to its potential. At the end, the basis of smart contract risk mitigation is based native solutions with decentralization at its core, following clear regulations and providing security and insurance to its clients. The development and maturity of systems in place will work as signaling tools for viable, secure, and regulated projects to shape the next phase of smart contracts. Building for Within Before Branching Out for Adoption Even though the search for native solutions is key to its risk mitigations, smart contract protocols also need to broaden their integrations within the space to create a seamless and simple experience for their users amid all the regulatory and technical improvements. As a result, smart contracts adoption roadmap will have to integrate different blockchain networks under a similar interface and seamless experience. Every party needs to be completely in-sync with its steps and inner-workings of executing smart contracts as if they were working with the usual traditional alternatives. Nevertheless, the perfect execution of smart contracts should not be the be-all and end-all as it is human-written code, but its role in the market should be evaluated as a function of the next best alternative. Following that criteria, the continuous development and tweaking of smart contacts offer much safer, faster, and transparent business procedures than current options. At Outlier Ventures, we believe in the censorship resistance economy built upon new decentralized models that overcome traditional problems while creating an entirely new Web 3 ecosystem, giving power to the end-user.

Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox, along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right, millions love us!) — what are you waiting for? What Is Leverage? In finance, leverage is a strategy that relies on using borrowed money to increase the potential return of an investment. In simple terms, an investor or a trader borrows funds to amplify the exposure to a certain type of assets, projects or instruments, more so than would be possible by relying only on his own capital. Normally, with leverages, investors will be able to multiply their buying power in the market. Leverage is common in everyday life, too. When you are using a credit card to buy a TV, or when you are using mortgages to buy a house, you are borrowing money and using leverages. Leverages in Cryptoasset Trading The use of leverages is one of the most important and commonly applied features in cryptoasset trading. Shortly after the establishment of centralized exchanges, trading with leverages became more and more popular, despite the fact that the crypto market already displays high volatility. Just like in traditional finance, traders take on leverages either to simply borrow money to increase their purchasing power, or to exploit different kinds of financial derivatives, like futures and options. The leverage ratios have also been increasing from 3x, 5x to more than 100x. Higher leverages mean higher risks, but as shown by the growing volumes of leveraged trading witnessed by most CEXes, this is a danger aggressive traders are willing to undertake, in pursuit of higher returns. Leverages in DeFi Whereas the general idea of leverages is the same in both traditional and crypto finance, a major difference lies in the action of borrowing. As the only identity on the blockchain is merely a string of alphabetic codes, it would be almost impossible to borrow upon credit. In other words, DeFi borrowing is usually fully collateralized. Furthermore, other differences exist between different DeFi financial models. Leverages in DeFi Borrowing DeFi borrowing and lending is one of the earliest and the biggest DeFi applications, with giants already operating on the market, like MakerDao, Compound, AAVE, Venus, etc. The logic of taking leverage through borrowing cryptoassets is simple. For example, if you are holding $10,000 ETH and feel bullish, you can deposit your ETH in Compound as collateral and borrow $5,000 USDC, then trade for another $5,000 ETH. You will get $15,000 exposure in ETH, which is equivalent to a 1.5x leverage, compared with your initial capital of $10,000. ‍Similarly, if you are bearish, you can choose to deposit stable coins and borrow ETH. If the ETH price drops, you can buy it back at a cheaper price on the market and repay your debt. Note that in case, since you would be borrowing funds from a decentralized protocol, if the value of collaterals decreases or the value of what you borrow increases beyond a certain threshold, you might get liquidated. Leverages in Margin Trading Margin trading is a method of trading assets using funds provided by other parties. Similar to direct borrowing, it provides traders with greater sums of capital, allowing them to leverage their positions. However, there is one important difference — while the margin position is open, the trader’s assets act as collateral for the borrowed funds. DYdX is perhaps the best known decentralized margin trading platform, and allows for up to 5x leverages. In dYdX’s margin trading, traders use their own funds as a guarantee, magnify their original principal by several multiples and use these magnified funds to make larger investments. Traders need to pay an interest fee as well as the costs associated with the transaction. The position is not synthetic and it involves real borrowing and purchasing/selling. If the market moves in an unfavorable direction, a trader’s assets may not be able to fully recover the loan borrowed. To prevent this from happening, the protocol will liquidate your position before getting to a certain liquidation ratio. A closer look at how the leverage may change in margin trading — Suppose you are longing ETH 3x in margin trading, but feel reluctant to adjust the exposure from time to time. You are holding $100 USDC, borrowing another $200 USDC and trading for $300 ETH in order to take the desired ETH long position. The leverage level is $300/$100\u003d3x. If the price of ETH rises by 20%, your profit will be $300(1+20%)-$300\u003d$60. You are safer from being liquidated and the real leverage level is decreased to $360/($360-$200)\u003d2.25x. In other words, you are automatically deleveraged by the ETH price rise. If the price of ETH drops by 20%, your loss will be $300(1-20%)-$300\u003d-$60. You are in a more dangerous position as far as liquidation is concerned and the real leverage level is increased automatically to $240/($240-$200)\u003d6x. In other words, you are re-leveraged by the ETH price drops, which shows you are in a more risky position than before. Therefore, though you may assume that you are taking constant leverage by doing a fixed 3x margin trading, the real-time leverage is constantly changing. Please check here how leverage changes according to the price movement. Leverages in Perpetual Contracts Perpetual contracts are similar to traditional futures contracts, but there is no expiry. Perpetual Contracts mimic a margin-based spot market and hence trade close to the underlying reference index price. There are a number of DeFi projects providing perpetual contracts for traders, like dYdX, MCDEX, Perpetual Protocol, Injective, etc. Many traders may find it hard to tell the difference between trading on margin and perpetual contracts — indeed, they both involve users’ getting leveraged. However, there are differences in the leveraging mechanisms, fees and leverage level. For more details, see this comparison provided by dYdX. Perpetuals are a type of derivative product trading synthetic assets that are margined. The tracking of the underlying asset price happens in a synthetic way, without the need to trade the real underliers. But margin trading involves real borrowing and transactions of the actual cryptoassets. Along with perpetuals comes the concept of funding rates, which aim to keep the traded price of the perpetual contract in line with the underlying reference price. If the price of the contract is above the spot price, longs will pay shorts. In other words, traders face an ongoing cost for borrowing funds. Leverages in perpetuals are normally higher than in margin trading and can go up to 100x. The liquidation and real leverage mechanisms are the same as in margin trading. Leverages in Leveraged Tokens Leveraged tokens are derivatives giving holders leveraged exposure to cryptocurrency markets, without having to worry about actively managing a leveraged position. While they offer leveraged exposure for holders, they do not require them to work on margins, liquidation, collateral or funding rates. The biggest difference between leverages tokens and margin trading/perpetuals is that leveraged tokens will rebalance themselves periodically or when reaching a certain threshold, in order to maintain certain leverage. This is obviously different from both margin trading and perpetuals - products whose real leverages are is constantly changing according to price fluctuations, even though traders may have designated a leverage level initially. FinNexus is launching a decentralized leverage token model in Q2 2021. See the details here. Let us take a look at how the rebalancing works following the 3x ETH example above. You are holding $100 USDC and purchase an ETHBULL (3x) leveraged token. The protocol will automatically borrow $200 in USDC and trade for $200 ETH. Suppose the price of ETH increases by 20% and the ETHBULL (3x) token price rises to $300*(1+20%)-$200\u003d$160 before rebalancing. Now, your real leverage becomes 2.25 ($360/$160), lower than the targeted leverage. As part of the rebalancing process, the protocol will borrow more USD from the stablecoin pool and purchase extra ETH tokens to shift the leverage back to 3x. In our example, the protocol would borrow another $120 and exchange it for ETH. The total leverage would thus become ($360+$120)/$160\u003d3x again. Suppose the price of ETH decreases by 20%, and the ETHBULL (3x) token price decreases to $300*(1-20%)-$200\u003d$40 before rebalancing. Now, your real leverage would become six ($240/$40), higher than the targeted leverage. In this case, the protocol would sell ETH tokens and repay the outstanding debt to deleverage. In the example, the protocol would sell $120 ETH for USD and pay back to the pool. The debt would become $80 and the total leverage would once again be ($240-$120)/$40\u003d3x. In other words, the leveraged token will automatically re-leverage in profit and deleverage in loss, to restore its targeted leverage level. If the mechanism works smoothly, even in unfavorable market trends, the leveraged token holders will never be liquidated, as the deleverage mechanism will constantly lower the effective leverage level for the users. The lending pool in the leveraged token model will thus be exempted from the risk of liquidation failure and more secure than lending pools in margin trading. Leverages in Options An option is essentially a right that can be exercised in the future. In order to acquire such a right, the buyer pays a sum and the consideration is called the risk premium. For a better understanding of how options work, please refer to this guide. There are a number of platforms focusing on decentralized options as mentioned here, but this particular DeFi derivative product is still at an early stage. Options naturally produce leverages as every contract represents a unit of the underlying asset while costing only a fraction of the price. This allows options traders to control their exposures on the same number of assets but at a much lower cost. Assume you have $1000 and wish to invest in ETH. ETH is at $2000 with $2000 strike price call options traded at $100. In this case, you could use all your available funds to own 0.5 unit of ETH, or you could buy 10 call options with a strike price of $2000 — meaning you’d be exposed to the volatility of 10 ETH! In our example, with the same amount of money, you could have 20 times more exposure to ETH than you would normally be able to by just buying the asset itself. That’s how leverage works in options trading. Following the example above: ‍If the ETH price grows by 20% to $2400 and you are holding 0.5 units of ETH, your profit in USD would be $200. However, if you are holding 10 calls on ETH, by exercising the call, your profit is 10*($2400-$2000)-$1000\u003d$3000. The rate of return is $3000/$1000*100%\u003d300%. The actual leverage is 300%/20%\u003d15x. You are automatically exposed to a leveraged position by holding a call. If the ETH price grows by 10% to $2200, by exercising the call, your profit is 10*($2200-$2000)-$1000\u003d$1000. The rate of return is $1000/$1000*100%\u003d100%. The actual leverage is 100%/10%\u003d10x. If the ETH price grows by 30% to $2600, by exercising the call, your profit is 10*($2600-$2000)-1000\u003d$5000. The rate of return is $5000/$1000*100%\u003d500%. The actual leverage is 500%/30%\u003d16.67x. You may notice that the real options’ leverage is not a fixed amount — it changes according to the price of the underlying assets. Summary Leverages can bring higher gains, but also higher risks. Different financial products may have very different ways of providing leveraged exposure for traders. Especially in DeFi, leveraged products may be powered by innovative models and new liquidity solutions that are not seen in traditional finance. Before trading on leverage, users should pay attention to the models deployed and do their own extensive research.

    "title": "What Is an Initial DEX Offering (IDO) and Why Do We Need Them?",
    "detailedContent": "What Is an Initial DEX Offering (IDO)? An initial DEX offering, or IDO, is a new and exciting type of decentralized and permissionless crowdfunding platform, which is opening up a new way of fundraising in the crypto space. If a project is launching an IDO, it means the project is launching a coin or token via a decentralized liquidity exchange. This is a type of crypto asset exchange that depends on liquidity pools where traders can swap tokens, including crypto coins and stablecoins. For instance, USDT/ETH is a liquidity pair. On CoinMarketCap\u0027s ICO calendar, there is a list of upcoming, live and past projects that are fundraising. The projects are categorized based on the various stages of its fundraising – IDO, IEO, private sale, public sale and crowdloan. As of August 2021, the past few months of projects fundraising are IDOs, perhaps signalling its popularity as a fundraising method.

Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox, along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right, millions love us!) — what are you waiting for? IDO – a Better Crypto Fundraising Model? IDOs are the successor of other crypto fundraising models, including initial coin offerings (ICOs), security token offerings (STOs) and initial exchange offerings (IEOs). Offering better and immediate liquidity at every price level due to its mechanics, IDOs are an excellent choice for new projects and startups keen to launch a token and access immediate funds. Unlike the aforementioned fundraising methods, IDOs are generally considered a fair way to launch a new cryptocurrency project by avoiding pre-mines, which is an issuance system that favors project founders over community members. The first ICO was the Mastercoin ICO in July 2013. In 2014, Ethereum raised money with a token sale, raising 3,700 BTC in its first 12 hours, roughly equivalent to $2.3 million at the time. The first IEO took place on April 17, 2019, launching on the Idax, BitForex, Bit-Z and Bit-M exchanges. Whereas, in June 2019, Raven Protocol announced that it was introducing the first-ever IDO, which would be listed on Binance DEX. Raven Protocol launched the first IDO in June 2019 What Are Some Successful Projects Launched From IDOs? Despite being the first, and even claiming in their blog that they didn’t know what an IDO was as it hadn’t been done at the time, Raven Protocol is considered a successful project. Raven Protocol IDO This is a decentralized and distributed deep-learning training protocol of deep neural networks. The Raven Protocol is working at providing cost-efficient and fast solutions that use the blockchain to transform the AI and machine learning industries, which are currently dominated by major corporations. With the aid of the native RAVEN token, contributors receive rewards by sharing their computer resources while the utility token is used for AI training. Universal Market Access Protocol IDO Another successful IDO project launch, even though its IDO had initial issues, is the Universal Market Access (UMA) protocol. This enables DeFi developers to build synthetic assets on Ethereum, which are collateral-backed tokens whose value changes. Last April, it launched its token sale via decentralized exchange Uniswap with a starting price of $0.26 per token. In order to get that price, UMA had to place $535,000 in Ethereum into a newly created liquidity pool. Notably, though, because token pricing on Uniswap works with a bonding curve rather than order books, the UMA token price quickly ramped up as investors lined up to purchase the token. As a result, traders attempted to get ahead of others by paying higher gas costs, which, ultimately, led to UMA’s token price jumping more than $2 minutes after the launch. It eventually stabilized at just over $1, with some buyers complaining that they bought at a higher price than pre-sale investors. This, however, highlights the issue with Uniswap rather than UMA. Despite this initial setback, UMA currently has a market capitalization worth over $1.5 billion, with one token costing more than $25. SushiSwap IDO Another similar example is that of SushiSwap, a decentralized crypto exchange built on Ethereum, which is attempting to take the place of Uniswap as the most popular Ethereum-based decentralized exchange. Last September, SushiSwap users reportedly migrated over $1.14 billion of Uniswap’s locked crypto assets to the SushiSwap platform. Interestingly, rather than issuing an ICO for SushiSwap, the platform rewarded liquidity providers (LP) on Uniswap by staking their LP tokens on SushiSwap. For this, users were rewarded in SUSHI tokens. During SushiSwap’s first two weeks, 1,000 SUSHI tokens were issued every Ethereum block, roughly every 12 seconds, to users who staked their Uniswap LP tokens on SushiSwap’s initial protocol. Why Do We Need IDOs? When ICOs and token sales became popular in 2017, raising an estimated $4.9 billion by the end of the year, many projects were attempting to solve problems using the blockchain. While many have gone on to succeed, with far more failing, it’s hard to avoid the fact that there are several issues with ICOs: they’re centralized and vulnerable. Other notable weaknesses of ICOs include third-party discrimination, vulnerability to theft and human error and a lack of privacy. With the decentralized nature of IDOs, this new fundraising model is attempting to solve the issues of ICOs while adding new possibilities to the crypto market. By crowdfunding with IDOs, entrepreneurs can release a blockchain product that goes beyond malicious third-party influencers, while eliminating any issues regarding hackers and human error. Not only that, but token buyers and holders’ coins are instantly secured on their wallet and private keys. AtomicDEX by Komodo supports instant listings for ERC-20 and QRC-20 tokens, providing a de facto IDO platform for new crypto projects. Advantages of an IDO An initial DEX offering has many clear advantages compared to initial exchange offerings (IEO) and initial coin offerings (ICO). Let’s list a few of those here. When raising funds for a project through an IEO or ICO, projects are first required to pay exchange fees and wait for a project to receive approval by the exchange before it’s listed. With IDOs, projects don’t have to pay high fees and don’t require anyone’s permission as it’s a completely decentralized offering. Additionally, instead of waiting for an exchange to approve a project, vocal community members are the ones who vet projects and tokens, which opens the door for small projects and massive collaborations. Compared to IEOs and ICOs, which involve an initial waiting period, IDOs provide immediate access to liquidity and trading. Added to that, IDOs help streamline users by delivering a secure wallet and trading platform support that’s built into one interface. It’s also possible for IDOs to support several types of wallets, thus simplifying the user’s experience. IDOs are gaining popularity and arguably more widely used for crypto fundraising than any other model existing today. Where Are IDOs Headed in the Future? IDOs are the newest way for crypto projects to get their tokens out to the public, but just with ICOs, IEOs and STOs, improvements are still needed. This is evidenced by UMA’s IDO. With IDOs, though, a decentralized exchange means there is a lack of control mechanism. When it comes to fundraising, it’s important to have some form of control to remove token price changes or have KYC regulations, which are noted in ICOs, IEOs, and STOs. Another improvement that should be focused on is scalability. Right now, only decentralized finance (DeFi) projects have raised money through IDOs; however, that’s not to say other projects within the crypto space can’t use this form of crowdfunding. Of course, for these projects to take off, they’ll need some interest from existing DeFi users to invest in a project’s token. Why? Simply because using DeFi platforms is a learning curve, which may be a barrier to the average crypto trader. Another improvement would be to boost awareness and education of DeFi as this industry grows. The concept behind crypto is to open the doors of finance by making it decentralized. IDOs are one step to making this happen, but who’s to say if a new project is the next best thing or a rug pull waiting to happen? Consequently, it’s difficult to say if a particular coin is worth X amount. Another factor to consider is that despite the rising interest in IDOs, centralized exchanges such as Binance or Coinbase still have control over the market. Investors aren’t asking when the next IDO listing is taking place. Right now, they’re interested in when Coinbase is going to list a specific coin. Of course, this will most likely change as awareness grows around decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and DeFi in general. The future of IDOs could be bright, but more awareness is needed. Not only that, but DeFi users are only a small fraction of the overall crypto market that is still a relatively niche field, but exponentially growing in size. That being said, as of August 2021, based on CoinMarketCap ICO calendar, the past few months of projects fundraising are largely IDOs.

    "detailedContent": "Every week, IntoTheBlock brings you on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. Analyzing the Impact of GBTC’s Unlock \u0026 Miners’ Stabilization During the past week, Bitcoin sustained its price around the $32K mark. The industry experienced several upcoming news that may bring volatility and speculation into the market, with the unlocking of Grayscale’s GBTC and miner activity both being closely-watched catalysts. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is an exchange-traded note that allows traditional finance investors the option to get exposure to Bitcoin without having to deal with the technical and legal obstacles that holding your own BTC implies. The fund currently holds 654,600 BTC, which has an approximate valuation of $21.47 billion. This constitutes 3.11% of the total Bitcoin supply of 21 million, making it the largest public Bitcoin holder. Recently, the news that Grayscale’s GBTC will be unlocking 40,000 Bitcoin has brought a lot of attention to the media and speculations regarding the last unlocks were drawn. Throughout this week, GBTC has been going through a process of unlocking the shares of institutional investors who subscribed directly to GBTC six months ago. This group of shares consist of all the new positions from Q1 2021. This will make it the largest ever unlock process in GBTC fund history. Notably, Ark Invest will be one of the public entities getting their GBTC unlocked, a company which earlier this month also filed to have their own Bitcoin ETF. To analyze the implications of this unlock, it is helpful to examine how GBTC has been performing relative to Bitcoin. As of July 12 via IntoTheBlock’s Capital Markets Insights Previously, individuals investing into GBTC were able to buy at a premium and they were able to capture the difference in the open market by selling their position after the unlock period. Following the Q1 2021 unlock process, the fund fell into a discount, as can be observed by the divergence starting to grow throughout February in the price performance chart above. During this July last unlock phase, possible opportunities for arbitrage trades will rise, bringing speculation and volatility into the market. Since GBTC traded at a premium six months ago, many traders were buying it and shorting BTC in spot markets to make the difference between the two. Now that these positions unwind at the unlock, it is likely that the complementary short positions will get closed, meaning that potentially the unlock would create buy pressure. On the other hand, JPMorgan sees the unlock as a risk for further downfall. They reportedly foresee investors who bought months ago as likely to take profits, leading to “downward pressure on GBTC princess and on Bitcoin markets more generally.” With valid arguments on both sides, it is worth keeping an eye out for potential volatility arising from the upcoming unlock. Another important market-driving event has been the mining migration. This has led to some challenges in the past months regarding China’s regulation enforcements and restrictions towards the mining activity ban in the country as covered in this piece. Miner Reserves measure all of the existing Bitcoin addresses that have ever minted Bitcoin and add their total balance in order to obtain their total reserve. This indicator has been affected by the mining migration. The reserve had been declining in BTC holdings throughout the last month, suggesting that miners were selling Bitcoin for cash. Throughout the last week, Bitcoin miner reserves started to increase, signalling a positive development following their significant drop in June. As of July 12 via IntoTheBlock’s mining indicators Over the past two weeks, Bitcoin miner reserves increased by 3.5%. What this could possibly mean is that the miners relocation is mostly over and that their migration expenses are already paid for. This had been a major concern since miner reserves had dropped approximately 7% from their May high, likely due to Chinese miners decreasing their holdings to fund moving expenses. In addition, an important metric which also has shown signs of relief is the hash rate. The hash rate is a measure of the aggregate computing power devoted by miners to secure the blockchain. Bitcoin’s hash rate had been in decline since the beginning of June when the China mining ban was implemented. Throughout the beginning of this month, the hash rate registered a slow but steady increase. As of July 12 via IntoTheBlock’s mining indicators As shown above, the hash rate increased from 62.03m TH/s on June 27 to a high of 115.45m TH/s on July 10, representing growth of 86%. The growth in hash rate reinforces the hypothesis that miner activity is stabilizing following their relocation phase. While the Grayscale unlock situation poses uncertainty, it is possible for its outcome to go either way. Regarding the mining events a positive trend is shown by both indicators given a possible signal that the worst is already over. There are also some relevant important upcoming news to keep in mind. Two congressmen of the country of Paraguay are looking to introduce a proposal for Bitcoin legislation and ETF’s fillings with the SEC keep piling up, currently major finance firms are in the process of being reviewed. Possibly this could be good news towards the industry. Both could continue to drive investment and adoption of it.

    "title": "HashMasks Become the Most Traded NFTs on OpenSea in a Single Week: Flipside Crypto",
    "detailedContent": "OpenSea is the largest secondary marketplace for trading crypto collectibles and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Users can sell and purchase collectibles like CryptoKitties or Crypto Punks, and even create their own marketplace to showcase new NFT collections — and as of Jan. 28, there’s a new superstar on the market. On Jan. 28, Hashmasks’s initial sale launched as a new set of digital art pieces created by more than 70 artists from across the globe. The next day, Hashmasks began appearing for resale on OpenSea. A total of 16,384 unique digital portraits exist — and that’s all that can ever be created. Each of these artworks is uniquely designed to be part digital art and part digital collectible. They are all designed to possess five basic characteristics: eye color, mask, skin color, character and an item. To add to the appeal of this project, there is also a fungible Ethereum token that you earn by owning a HashMask and can spend to change the name of your artwork. Who Made How Much? Suum Cuique Labs, from Zug, Switzerland is the project behind Hashmasks. They collected $13.4M in the six days of their initial sale. In just a week, Hashmasks were traded 2,724 times on OpenSea at an average price of $3,300. These transactions add up to a total of $8.9MM in profits that went to the NFT owners. $223,486 were collected by OpenSea in fees. Hashmask is the only project that does not have its own trading platform. Other NFTs like CryptoKitties have their own marketplace that exists outside of OpenSea. This means that unlike most NFTs, all Hashmask resales occur on secondary marketplaces and therefore the resale market fees go to the marketplaces (i.e. OpenSea) instead of the project owner (in this case Suum Cuique Labs). Comparing Hashmasks to Other NTFs on OpenSea Even looking out over the past six months, Hashmasks still come out as the most traded NFTs on OpenSea, and the most expensive to purchase. And while the total supply of Hashmasks is limited to 16K, the scarcity does not explain the high price. There are only 13K total Brave Frontier Heroes and accessories and yet they sell for an average price of $31. In second place in terms of transaction count are Brave Frontier Heroes, which were traded 836 times in the past six months. Zed Run\u0027s digital horse racing NFTs come in third, with 570 sales on OpenSea in the same timeframe. Megacryptopolis — a city builder game — has the second most expensive NFTs traded on OpenSea — averaging at $1,308 per token.

Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. Bitcoin Surpasses $40K With On-Chain Indicators Turning Bullish After a few weeks of sideways price action, it appears that Bitcoin may be showing signs that the worst has passed. Climbing from $32,000 to over $40,000 over the past seven days, Bitcoin has been propelled by positive news and key on-chain indicators pointing to significant buying activity. In terms of news, there were plenty, but Elon Musk continues to be one of the biggest influences in Bitcoin’s price. His most recent tweet about Tesla potentially accepting Bitcoin again led to a price increase of 5.5% within four hours. Source: Twitter The recent increase led to Bitcoin closing above $40,000 for the first time since May 20. Along with this growth, Bitcoin’s share of the crypto market has been increasing too. After a pronounced downtrend up to May, Bitcoin’s dominance appears to be making a reversal since the recent crash. As of June 15, 2021 via CoinMarketCap A similar pattern emerged in 2017, with Bitcoin’s dominance dropping over 40% from January to July. After a crash in July, Bitcoin recovered faster than the market, leading its dominance to climb steadily until December. Moreover, Bitcoin does tend to lead following significant corrections, as also occurred in September 2020, breaking previous all-time highs before most crypto-assets. This pattern appears to have been noticed recently by analysts from JP Morgan. “We believe that the share of bitcoin in the total crypto market would have to normalize and perhaps rise above 50% (as in 2018) to be more comfortable in arguing that the current bear market is behind us” — analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou as per a CoinDesk article. While many still await confirmation of the bottom being in, sentiment is turning bullish. Wall Street billionaire Paul Tudor Jones was quite vocal recently about his conviction in Bitcoin, signalling he wants to increase his allocation in Bitcoin to 5%. In a similar note, MicroStrategy continues to seek greater Bitcoin holdings. The publicly listed company issued $500 million worth of bonds to finance further Bitcoin acquisitions. On-chain indicators echo the buying trend among market participants. Centralized exchanges netflows point to significantly more Bitcoin being withdrawn from exchanges than deposited into them. As of June 15, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin Exchange Flows For the second time this month, over $1 billion net in Bitcoin left centralized exchanges. This typically points to large buying activity, as investors seek to hold their crypto in more secure wallets. By looking at addresses’ profitability we can confirm that Bitcoin holders took advantage of the opportunity to buy below $40,000. This is evident in the Historical In/Out of the Money, where it shows that 80% of addresses are currently “in the money”, or profiting from their holdings. As of June 15, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin Financial Indicators When comparing this to the last time Bitcoin had 80% of holders in the money, we observe that Bitcoin’s price was at $53,600. Despite the drop in price, the percentage of Bitcoin holders profiting from their position climbed back to this level, pointing to many addresses bringing their average cost down. Overall, both on-chain indicators and recent news align on a potential turning point for Bitcoin. After underperforming throughout 2021, many are looking at Bitcoin’s reversal as a leading indicator for what may come next. In that case, the high outflows in Bitcoin from centralized exchanges and high percentage of holders profiting suggest buying momentum is shifting bullish for the largest crypto-asset.

    "detailedContent": "With thanks to our user community and more than 6,000 responses, we are glad to announce the results of the 2020 Most Influential Poll! As both the DeFi wave in summer 2020 and the institutional investments and interests towards the end of the year both had significant impact on the market, we surveyed our users and asked which event they thought had a larger impact on the cryptocurrency market — more responses indicated that the institutional investments and interests had a larger impact. Most Influential Person in Crypto: 2020 Based on our poll for most influential, Vitalik Buterin is the most influential person in cryptocurrency in 2020! With the development of Ethereum 2.0, the ETH price surge and Ethereum’s heavy involvement in the DeFi summer, Vitalik Buterin plays an important role in pushing, not only Ethereum, but the whole cryptocurrency space forward. Here are the rest of the top 10 most influential people, by alphabetical order: Links to their profiles: Alex Mashinsky, Andre Cronje, Andreas Antonopoulos, Anthony Pompliano, Changpeng Zhao, Charles Hoskinson, Emin Gün Sirer, Michael Saylor, Satoshi Nakamoto‍ Most Influential Entrepreneurs in Crypto: 2020 Here are the top three most influential people in the Entrepreneur \u0026 Business Leaders category, by alphabetical order: Links to their profiles: Changpeng Zhao, Charles Hoskinson, Emin Gün Sirer Most Influential Finance Leaders in Crypto: 2020 Here are the top three most influential people in the Investment \u0026 Finance Leaders category, by alphabetical order: Links to their profiles: Alex Mashinsky, Brad Garlinghouse, Michael Saylor Most Influential Tech Leaders in Crypto: 2020 Here are the top three most influential people in the Technology Leaders category, by alphabetical order: Links to their profiles: Charles Hoskinson, Emin Gün Sirer, Vitalik Buterin Because of insufficient responses for the Media \u0026 Journalists category, we are not able to publish the results.

    "title": "See the First Terra Data Dashboards Now: Flipside Crypto",
    "detailedContent": "Terra data has arrived. Now, it’s time to take a deeper dive into the ecosystem on the Flipside ecosystem with our Terra data dashboards. And we’re getting some help from Joan Kallogieri and our official Terra ambassador, @mike_platis. Terra’s Suite of Stablecoins For those that are not familiar, Terra consists of a group of stablecoins that mirror the value of real-world fiat currencies. Many different use cases are in the works for these currencies. In fact, as Joan points out, Terra is designed to allow you to earn interest on stablecoins, spend crypto easily with merchants, and replace most of your banking needs with one seamless DeFi protocol. Activity Picks Up for New Terra Wallets We’ll start our analysis by taking a look at the daily transaction numbers for different wallet types on Terra. As we can see in the graph below, larger wallets (defined as those holding more than $100K in value) and smaller wallets (everyone else) alike seem to be pulling their weight equality. According to Joan, this could indicate that Terra usage is diversified by both whales and smaller players. Legend: Green — smaller wallets; Gray — larger wallets When we compare new and old wallets, meanwhile, older accounts have mostly dominated usage. When we look at the last few days, however, we can see an increase in usage from newer accounts, which could signal that new users are becoming more active. Legend: Green — older wallets; Gray — newer wallets Staking Spikes During Bull Run Next up is a look at the viability of Validators during the recent LUNA price drop. As @mike_platis reminds us, LUNA holders do not stake their tokens directly. Instead, they delegate their Luna to a validator, giving a wider range of LUNA holders access to rewards. When we examine staking activities, as can be seen below, there’s a surprise. The raw volume of staking spiked during the peak of the bull-run in mid-March, rather than during the recent price drop. “The three highest volume days of total delegations were followed by the three worst drops percentage-wise in LUNA\u0027s price” @mike_platis noted. “It seemed as if delegators anticipated the correction of their over-extended asset.” Legend: Green — delegations; Red — undelegations Also interestingly, staking supply has continually grown in recent months, regardless of the price of LUNA itself. Even immediately after the drop in price, @mike_platis, points, activity continued to increase, showing users’ confidence in the overall ecosystem. “Terra passed this stress test relatively well,” @mike_platis noted. “Convicted holders became buyers and immediately put their LUNA to work by staking it. This shows a real demand for LUNA as collateral and as a productive asset. LUNA is positioned as a value capture for all activity within the ecosystem.” Legend: Green — average price; Gray — staked supply Those who did remain in the network saw a decreasing tax rate. That can be expected to continue, @mike_platis said, as staking activity and transactions each continue to increase over time. Learn More Want to learn more about the Terra ecosystem?

    "title": "Tesla, Dogecoin \u0026 Institutional Interest: A Data Perspective by IntoTheBlock",
    "detailedContent": "Every week, IntoTheBlock brings you on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. This week we analyze the impact Tesla and Elon Musk have had on crypto. Particularly, we dive into data comparing the types of players getting involved with Bitcoin vs. Dogecoin and what may come next. Tesla Renews Institutional Interest in Bitcoin Tesla has caused major ripples throughout the crypto after disclosing it bought $1.5 billion in Bitcoin and plans to accept crypto as payments. The announcement comes a few days after Elon Musk changed his Twitter bio simply to “Bitcoin.” Elon Musk has since deleted the bio, but announced something much larger. Tesla joins the likes of Square and MicroStrategy as public companies owning Bitcoin on their balance sheet. With the addition of Tesla’s investment, this would mean over $6 billion in Bitcoin is held by publicly traded corporations as per Bitcoin Treasuries. The electric vehicle company is now the second largest publicly-traded corporation holding Bitcoin, second only to MicroStrategy. In comparison to Michael Saylor’s company, though, Tesla’s stock had already accrued remarkable growth prior to investing in Bitcoin. As of Feb. 10, 2021 through IntoTheBlock’s free capital markets insights Bitcoin has slightly underperformed Tesla over the last year, though the gap between the two has been narrowing. Additionally, while the two appeared to move in tandem in early January, their correlation coefficient has dropped to only 0.07, implying little to no statistical relationship between the two in the past 30 days. However, this is likely to increase following Tesla’s investment of 8% of its cash available in Bitcoin. While institutional adoption has already been a recurring narrative for Bitcoin in 2020 and 2021, Tesla may be kicking off interest amongst a broader category of large corporations. On-chain data suggests that this widespread institutional interest may have already begun. As of Feb. 10, 2021 through IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin financial metrics The average transaction size recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain had just hit a record the day Tesla announced their investment, just to be shattered by next day’s whopping $440,000 average transaction. The high magnitude of six-figure transactions point to institutional activity in Bitcoin reaching new highs. Needless to say, the market has taken much more positively Tesla’s actions over Elon’s bio update. Not only did Bitcoin hit new highs on the day of Tesla’s disclosure, but exchange activity pointed to low impact on sellers. Typically as the price of a cryptoasset increases, so do exchange deposits as investors look to take profits. Net Flows — which subtract exchange deposits (inflows) minus withdrawals (outflows) — hit a yearly high following Elon Musk’s update. On the day of Tesla’s announcement, though, net flows barely increased, potentially signalling that this move could be more indicative of a point of inflection than a selling opportunity. As of Feb. 10, 2021 through IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin exchange metrics Now onto Elon Musk’s other favorite cryptocurrency. Doge Wows Investors Source: Twitter From Elon Musk to Kiss’s bassist Gene Simmons to Snoop Dogg to Mia Khalifa… Dogecoin has grown virally. The meme cryptocurrency started as a joke has managed to reach a market capitalization of over $10 billion. While Elon Musk recently admitted his comments on Dogecoin are “mostly a joke,” the market may be taking the currency more seriously than he does. Sparked by celebrity (unofficial) endorsements, retail interest in the meme cryptocurrency has spiked massively. Source: CoinMarketCap Having increased approximately 90x from its March bottom, it is fair to say that Dogecoin has gone parabolic. Note that this is the case even with the logarithmic scale on the chart above. Along with the remarkable appreciation, Dogecoin speculation has certainly followed. This is evidenced by the number of addresses that have been holding Doge for under 30 days — categorized as traders by IntoTheBlock. Source: IntoTheBlock Within the last month the number of traders in Dogecoin has reached new highs, increasing over 30% in the last month alone. At the same time, the total volume belonging to traders has decreased by 3%, indicating that high volume traders may no longer be holding. Instead, it is mostly retail traders taking part in the recent surge in Dogecoin. Despite managing to increase dramatically, Dogecoin’s average holder has less than $3,000 worth of Doge. Source: IntoTheBlock For comparison, Bitcoin’s average balance is approximately $24,000. This further displays the retail-driven mania markets have been experiencing. Following Gamestop’s quick boom and bust, investors are advised to proceed with caution as meme assets favored by retail investors have demonstrated to be volatile and highly speculative. While there certainly still is retail participation in Bitcoin, Bitcoin’s investment from large corporations such as Tesla may be much more telling than all the Dogecoin tweets together. Despite Elon Musk’s interest in both, on-chain data suggests demand for Bitcoin is stemming from much larger players than Dogecoin’s.

    "detailedContent": "CoinMarketCap Q2 Recap Crypto investors might feel that they were riding a roller coaster in Q2 2021 😅. In mid-April, Bitcoin hit an all-time high in price, Ethereum then caught up in May and the total market cap also reached its ATH on the same day. However, everything has cooled down again in the second half of the quarter and BTC is now down to the lowest price since this bull run began. There has also been a new meme coin heat wave, with tokens being named after all sorts of dog breeds and animals receiving attention from investors. While the crypto market experienced ATH craziness and investors and laypeople alike began chasing these little meme cuties around, the CoinMarketCap team has also been crazily busy in providing you with a better experience and more useful tools. Have you noticed all the enhancements we’ve done? Let’s have a look! Subscribe Join us in showcasing the cryptocurrency revolution, one newsletter at a time. Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox, along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right, millions love us!) — what are you waiting for? The CoinMarketCap Website We made some bold moves in Q2 2021 by creating more projects to showcase the ongoing mass adoption of cryptocurrency. Prior to Q2, we had built up some basic foundations for the site, and now it was time for us to go deeper and wider. CoinMarketCap\u0027s homepage as of July 15, 2021 — remember this for posterity! We’ve accomplished a few important milestones, including: 1. NFT listing page: The NFT mania started in Q1 2021, and although we have NFT-related token listings already on CoinMarketCap, it\u0027s also very important to display NFT asset rankings so that you can have a brief idea of the entire NFT landscape. 2. Project event calendar: While you are researching investment opportunities, having a centralized place for catching up with all major events from projects is essential. Maybe you want to join AMAs to learn more about a project, or to know in advance what’s going to happen for projects you care about — all these facets are important to follow and watch out for in the crypto space. 3. ICO calendar and the ICO information: ICOs (initial coin offering) or IDOs (initial DEX offering) are significant in getting the first-mover adventage for crypto investors. With more information displayed for a project and their initial offering, all the data and information presented can be a major source of important information. We also added some useful information like token distribution schedule and % allocated (for limited projects), holders’ information and the rich list of a project. All in all, we want you to make better decisions from the different data sets we provide. 4. Fiat vs crypto ranking and company vs crypto ranking: Have you ever wondered how crypto can be compared with fiat currencies or the biggest companies in the world? The new rankings provide you an interesting comparison for different kinds of assets, and might also help you to make some investment decisions! 5. Price estimation: There have been all kinds of different methods for estimating the price of cryptocurrencies, but none of them are 100% accurate and it’s usually hard to understand the algorithm behind these numbers. Instead of us scratching our heads to figure out the methodology, we think all of our users have more intelligence than us, and with the power of crowdsourced knowledge we might be able to make a good prediction of how the crypto trends will go. 6. Airdrop calendar and airdrop campaigns: An airdrop is a unique activity happening frequently in the crypto world. As we have been in contact with thousands of projects, and millions of users, we thought it would be cool if we could bridge the gap between projects and users, and provide a platform for our users to access all these benefits much easier. 7. Heatmap: We know that lots of our users are very busy and only have limited time to glance at the market most of the time. Our coin rankings are good, but not something instinctively easy to get a sense of price moves. Our new heatmap is prepared for this kind of user who can easily judge the market from the red/ green on the graphic! We know it’s hard to see the screen all in red but it indeed feels good when the heatmap is all green for some good days! 8. Portfolio enhancement: You asked and we listened! Ever since we released our portfolio feature, lots of users have given us feedback that they want to have more advanced features available. One of them is the ability to host multiple portfolios on CoinMarketCap! We made it happen for you! Now with a few clicks, you can have different portfolios for various purposes. 9. Token swap: To connect the dots in crypto adoption, one very important factor is the easiness of fund movements. We started by providing you the ability to connect to your wallets and make swaps on Uniswap and PancakeSwap, but stay tuned, this is just a start of everything and more will be coming! 10. Loyalty program - CoinMarketCap Diamonds: We also know that we have a large group of users who like us and grow with us. No matter if you have been with us for a long time, or you are new here, we are always grateful and want to thank you for accompanying us. From now on when you come to our site, don’t forget to collect diamonds and in the very near future, there will be some exciting rewards you can exchange your diamonds with. 11, Guess which country will make crypto a legal tender next: El Salvador just recently passed the law to recognize Bitcoin as legal tender — the first country in the world to do so. We are all very excited about this news and we believe there could be more countries following El Salvador. We want to know more about how you think and made a small guessing tournament for it! Come join us to predict and chances to win more diamonds too!! Apart from these new features, we are also aiming to provide more stable and reliable services across our different products. To prepare for this, we’ve invested a huge amount of resources in rewriting the APIs/ engines behind the scenes, and gradually replacing the old ones with higher performance APIs all around the site.

    "title": "TI Weekly Research - Great Delivery Day",
    "detailedContent": "June 25 is a special day in the crypto asset market. Usually, every Friday marks the peak delivery of derivatives, with price fluctuation to a certain extent. On June 25, the futures and options expiry dates will encompass the following: The current week The following week June July 2021 Q1 next quarter And 2021 Q2 current quarter Additionally, a large number of institutions will carry out options allocations around this day. At a time when the market appears to be sluggish after a series of blows, the movements of institutional and professional investors have become increasingly important indicators. This information may yield certain \"clues” about the market trend in the second half of 2021. Recent transactions of BTC options, source: metrics.deribit.comBefore and after delivery: trading volume rises under the supervision‍ Around June 25, derivatives information caused the prices of mainstream crypto assets to fluctuate sharply, adding to an already volatile market. Due to strict regulations and more bearish news, Bitcoin’s price once fell to around $29,000, while the weekly spot trading volume rose to $82.19 billion compared to last week. This all occurred amidst the selling pressure of shorts and moves from whale investors. Bitcoin price changes in the past seven days, as of 5:00 am on June 25. Source: tokeninsight.com Short-term speculative sentiment has also risen. Bitcoin\u0027s historical volatility has increased to more than 100 after a month or so of decline. Another indicator shows the weekly volume of perpetual contracts reaching $622.8 billion, pointing to a recurring rise in speculative sentiment. Changes in the volatility of Bitcoin index prices and perpetual contract prices, as of 5:00 am on June 25. Source: gvol.io A similar situation can be seen with Ethereum. After three months, the price of Ethereum once again returned to a level below $2,000, while weekly trading volume reached $50.78 billion due to selling pressure. It experienced an increase of 35.52% compared to last week, and contract trading reached $209.6 billion (increasing 43.76% compared to the previous week). Ethereum price changes in the past 90 days, as of 5:00 am on June 25. Source: tokeninsight.com In both the perpetual contract market and options market this week, there were many short-term large-value options trades. On June 21, large-value traders purchased a significant number of short-term Bitcoin put options on Deribit, with strike prices ranging from $28,000 to $34,000. In the Ethereum market, traders also purchased short-term large-value put options on the same day, with strike price of $2400 and face value of 300 ETH. Judging from the recent price trend, it is undoubtedly a small profit. The large transaction of Bitcoin options on Deribit on June 21. Source: gvol.io The large trading volume of Ethereum options on Deribit on June 21. Source: gvol.io According to data from Deribit, a total of $4 billion in options contracts expired on Friday. Among them, BTC was $2.56 billion, and ETH was $1.42 billion. These were lower than the amounts on the \"Great Delivery Day\" in Q1 (March 26) and the month-end delivery date on April 30. However, the importance of this delivery day is even greater than that of the previous two. The reason being that this options delivery contains the contracts of the current week, next week, current month, next month, 2021 Q2 current quarter, 2021 Q1 next quarter. At the same time, the next cycle of options and futures allocation will be carried out before and after this delivery, which is why this delivery day is worth studying. The current options and futures data indeed seem to have shown some clues about the market’s future development.

What\u0027s Next For Bitcoin? Let’s ignore the turbulent macro information. We already know that inflation reduction and interest rate hikes have nine months remaining before their impact is fully revealed. The Whales\u0027 movements in the second half of 2021 may play a more important role. From their movements, we can get a glimpse of some pressing information: Bitcoin options transactions in the past 30 days. Source: gvol.io On June 22, there was a large Bitcoin transaction of close to 7,000 contracts. Based on the date, it is undoubtedly from institutional or professional investors. So, what did they do during this time? Bitcoin options trading on June 22. Source: gvol.io Pay attention to the two largest transactions. One is the purchase of a $20,000 call option that expires on June 25, and the other is the sale of a put option that expires on March 25 of the following year with a strike price of $25,000. At that time, the price of Bitcoin was around $32,000. It means that some whales believe that the price of Bitcoin will not be less than $25,000 in this six-month period and that it will not be less than $32,000 after a short-term correction. The movement of the other whale is more worthy of attention: he sold 1,200 call options contracts with the strike price of $64,000, and bought 800 call option contracts with the strike price of $70,000. The execution times were respectively December 31 and March 25 of the following year. The price of deep out-of-the-money options is relatively low, and the operation of deep out-of-the-money options can indicate the whale’s prediction of the market.

As for buying $70,000 of options, it may be to hedge the possible price increase risk. What\u0027s Next For Ethereum? Ethereum\u0027s trends are mostly concentrated in the short term.

Meanwhile, the transaction records of large call options were mostly centered on the quarterly contracts that expire on September, 24 and the strike price was around $2000-2500. Professional investors do not seem to be optimistic about the short-term performance of Ethereum. But they are more confident about performance in the long term. The skewness also shows a similar situation: Ethereum forward options have been incorporating optimism into their pricing. The performance of Ethereum options skewness. Source: gvol.io Judging from the operations of the whales, we may be facing a more turbulent market in July. The big investors\u0027 bearishness on Ethereum seems to be due to their concerns and bets about the upcoming London upgrade. On the other hand, the limited optimism for Bitcoin is only long-term, and the recent low volatility of Bitcoin’s price will continue. The volatility skewness turned negative in recent days, indicating that the whales have re-adjusted their market expectations for mainstream crypto assets.

    "title": "The Flipside Stablecoin Recipe for Success",
    "detailedContent": "What are the on-chain metrics that matter most for the success of stablecoins? In this report, we focus on USDC specifically, and look at its DeFi activity and health in comparison to three other leading stablecoins (USDT, DAI and PAX). All data visuals were created using Velocity, which is public and free for anyone to create queries. Access velocity: https://app.flipsidecrypto.com/auth/signup What Metrics Really Matter for Stablecoins? There are a few important facets to consider when evaluating the health of stablecoins on Ethereum. Here is our take: Liquidity Is there enough to manage demand? How is it broken out at a high level? Supply Is it active and healthy? Who is using the top stablecoins, where, and how many protocols support them? Peg How reliable is the peg? Transaction Fees How much are users paying to use the stablecoin? ‍ Total Value Locked in DeFi How much stablecoin supply is staked in known DeFi protocols? An important ingredient in the picture of stablecoin health: the more stablecoins are used in more protocols, the higher this number will grow over time. Access to CSV and API endpoints for this data: https://velocity-app.flipsidecrypto.com/shareable/tvl-ZxRPeY Volume, Active Addresses and Transaction Counts We break out these three fundamental metrics for on-chain activity into three buckets: DeFi + DEX; CEX; and Other, to observe overall growth in use of stablecoins and to see which categories are spurring that growth. Access to CSV and API endpoints for this data: https://velocity-app.flipsidecrypto.com/shareable/triumvirate-bWzSFF Liquidity and Number of Holders To track the number of active users, we observe both the liquidity they control, as well as the number of addresses that control it. In general, the more liquidity controlled by the more users (addresses) the better. We also break this metric out by DeFi + DEX; DEX; and Other for added information. Access to CSV and API endpoints for this data: https://velocity-app.flipsidecrypto.com/shareable/liquidity-SzIz2w Developer Preference/Support Stablecoins used by more protocols are more likely to be foundational parts of the space’s rapid expansion. We count the number of projects, including DeFi protocols, Decentralized Exchanges, dApps, and Centralized exchanges that support or rely on stablecoins for their operation. This is an indicator of developer preference and it is clear from this metric that USDC, DAI, and USDT are the default choices. Access to CSV and API endpoints for this data: https://velocity-app.flipsidecrypto.com/shareable/protocols-ZGNEe8 How Reliable Is the Peg to the US Dollar for USDC? We use CoinMarketCap’s price ticks bucketed by day to show variance in peg. This is a fundamentally important metric that underpins each stablecoin’s perceived legitimacy and reliability to the user community. Access to CSV and API endpoints for this data: https://velocity-app.flipsidecrypto.com/shareable/variance-KCfD9K How Much Users Pay to Transact Fees paid for stablecoin transactions over the last nine months underpin the choice by users to pay in some cases significant sums to send, stake, and otherwise use stablecoins by category.

    "title": "On-Chain Analysis of the May 2021 FUD: A Data Perspective by IntoTheBlock",
    "detailedContent": "Every week, IntoTheBlock brings you on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. On-Chain Analysis of the May 2021 FUD Crypto markets endured a significant correction throughout the last week for the most part. In a week loaded with negative news, which we’ll get into shortly, prices in Bitcoin and Ether dropped double digits. The exception to this trend has been DeFi tokens, with most of them managing to rise regardless. As of May 18, 2021 through IntoTheBlock’s Capital Markets Insights As can be seen above, Bitcoin and Ether holders incurred a 21% and 16% loss over the past seven days, at least on paper (this piece was written before Bitcoin\u0027s correction to below $33,000). The bearish trend comes after strong rallies in both crypto-assets with Bitcoin and Ether having reached a 124% and 491% return respectively prior to the recent correction. Many point to several negative news emerging throughout the past week as the catalyst for the recent FUD—that is fear, uncertainty and doubt, for those uninitiated in crypto parlance. Recapping the recent FUD, one of the biggest culprits is someone who might have been framed as a hero within crypto not too long ago. I’m talking of course about Elon Musk, whose influence in Twitter is as apparent as ever. The saga begun as Elon tweeted the following statement about Tesla no longer accepting Bitcoin payments: Source: Twitter The statement was a complete u-turn from beginning to accept Bitcoin payments just over a month ago. Bitcoin dropped as much as 15% within three hours after the tweet. Following the announcement, thousands (millions?) of Twitter accounts messaged Elon Musk eager to have him change his mind. While he engaged in multiple occasions, his frustration grew noticeable, leading up to to the following one-word reply: Source: Twitter The tweet resulted in another drawdown—this time of 7%—within the following three hours. Though the tweet hinted that Tesla had sold their Bitcoin position, a day later he clarified that was not the case. On top of the FUD caused by Elon’s tweets over the past week, there have also been other news exacerbating the downtrend. For instance, an article on Bloomberg brought to light an investigation from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) into Binance, which may have spooked some investors although Binance is said to be collaborating with law enforcement on this. Finally, Reuters reiterated the message from Chinese officials banning institutions from participating in cryptocurrency activity, though not individuals. While this may initially appear to be new regulation from the Chinese government, in reality they are simply repeating and clarifying the measures they had already imposed in 2013 and 2017, according to a CoinDesk piece. The impact of this news was felt in Bitcoin’s on-chain activity. For one, exchange inflows—which track the total amount deposited into centralized cryptocurrency exchanges—reached its highest level in three months. As of May 18, 2021 through IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin Exchange Flows With over 85K Bitcoin (nearly $3.8 billion USD) transferred into centralized exchanges, Bitcoin’s exchange inflow volume has grown 270% relative to 30 days ago. Bitcoin inflows also hit levels above 70K BTC on May 12 and May 13, when Elon’s “Tesla and Bitcoin” tweet and the Binance investigation occurred. Though not all of the inflows here can be directly tied to these events, it is clear that Elon Musk and the slew of bad news impacted the market. Therefore, it is likely that a significant portion of these inflows came from users depositing their Bitcoin into centralized exchanges looking to sell. Despite the deep sell-off, not all indicators are pointing to negative patterns. To the contrary, on-chain ownership indicators show that Bitcoin supply is consolidating among larger holders, as evidenced by the growth in an address’s average balance. As of May 18, 2021 through IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin financial indicators After falling consistently throughout the first quarter of the year, the average balance of Bitcoin addresses has begun to increase. The trend changed shortly after Bitcoin hit $60,000 and continues to accelerate despite — or likely because of — the recent correction. This pattern suggests that selling off from large players has slowed down and buying activity has accelerated. It also points to the likelihood of smaller players potentially selling their positions due the recent FUD. Overall, crypto markets endured an eventful week with Elon Musk and various news flooding with short-term negativity. While this led to a wave of exchange inflows and selling activity, it is likely that the trend may reverse as buying activity from large players picks up as evidenced by the increasing average Bitcoin address balance.

    "detailedContent": "Since January, the shocks in the crypto market do not show any sign of stopping. Bitcoin has experienced many call-backs (between $40,000 and $30,000) after breaking $30,000 at the beginning of January. Other assets show strong correlations with Bitcoins, which reflects the market sentiments correspondingly. The good news is some indicators show positive signals of the near future market. ‘From Peak to Trough’ After the price of Bitcoin called-back to $39,000 last week, it stabilized around $36,000. However, the peace time was relatively short: Since Jan. 20, Bitcoin dropped to $29,112 on Coinbase at 0:30 UTC on Thursday, a level last reached on Jan. 4 when the leading cryptocurrency started rallying hard to an all-time high of just below $42,000 on Jan. 8.

The impact is obvious — except for a few “Blue Chips” like DOT, ETH and stablecoins — lending protocols tokens are following Bitcoin’s step and dropping significantly, about 10% down within 24 hours, especially for BNB and COMP, which saw decreases of about 20%.

Source: tokeninsight.com DOT Prices Remain Stable and Trading Volume Doubles The biggest dark horse in the crypto market of January 2021 is none other than DOT. In the huge fluctuations, DOT has been holding on for a week: and this week, DOT bucked the trend again. Although the price did not increase significantly, the weekly trading volume increased by 110.76% compared to last week, and broke through $10B, which makes a new record. As public chains other than BTC and ETH, Polkadot and Ripple have been competing for the third position of cryptos for a long time. With the gradual improvement of the Polkadot ecology and Ripple\u0027s regulatory turmoil, it seems that we have a winner.

    "title": "Swap With MDEX on CoinMarketCap",
    "detailedContent": "Earlier this month, CoinMarketCap made it possible for our users to swap tokens right on our site. Before, you could only check the price of a token on CoinMarketCap before going elsewhere to swap — we’ve made it even easier for you by putting swaps right where you check your prices. You no longer will have to navigate away from CoinMarketCap’s price page, perhaps losing valuable seconds before you make your swap — and as we know, every second counts in crypto! With the addition of MDEX swapping on CoinMarketCap, users can swap tokens using both Uniswap and MDEX, two of the most popular exchanges on CoinMarketCap. For every supported network and token, you will be able to connect your supported crypto wallet and start swapping in a safe and secure way. What Is MDEX? MDEX is a decentralized trading protocol, launched in January 2021, that operates with the concept of fund pools. As an automated market maker (AMM), MDEX uses a dual-chain model on both the Ethereum network and the Huobi Ecological Chain (HECO). MDEX claims to support a confirmation time of about three seconds, as well as low gas fees, due to the dual-chain model that takes advantage of the best parts of both the ETH and HECO networks. What Networks, Wallets and DEXs Does CoinMarketCap Token Swap Support? Below is a list of the currently supported DEXs, wallets and networks for CoinMarketCap’s token swaps. Supported DEXs Uniswap and MDEX. Supported Wallets At this time, wallets supported by Uniswap and MDEX will also be available for the CoinMarketCap token swap. Uniswap: MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet, Fortmatic and Portis for Uniswap swapping. MDEX: MetaMask, TrustWallet, MathWallet, TokenPocket, WalletConnect and SafePal Wallet for MDEX swapping. Supported Networks Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain and HECO are the networks supported at this time. How to Use Token Swaps on CoinMarketCap First, navigate to the page of the coin that you wish to swap. You will see a converter between a selection of two coins on the right side of the page, and the option to “Swap on CoinMarketCap.” Once you click to swap, you will be able to select the cryptos that you wish to swap and the amount. At this point, you will need to connect a wallet and sign the blockchain transaction. Make sure that you have checked the liquidity provider fee that will be charged, the route, the price impact, the minimum received and the slippage tolerance before confirming your swap.

    "detailedContent": "Welcome to the first edition of the Uniswap Dashboard Debrief! All this week, we’ll be taking a closer look at the data behind Uniswap V3 as we work to build the world’s best dashboard. You can join us, and earn 500UNI, by contributing a question that makes it to our dashboard. Just join us on Discord to get started! We’ll get started this week by taking a look at the TVL — or total value locked — of Uniswap V3. Total value locked represents the amount of assets that are currently being staked in a specific protocol. As you can see in the chart below, Uniswap V3 TVL hit its current all-time high at roughly midday Eastern Time in the U.S. on Friday, May 14, as total liquidity topped 1 billion at 11 AM and remained over that milestone for roughly 2 hours before dropping — hard. By 2 PM the same day, TVL had fallen to just over 750 million, its lowest level in roughly two days. TVL rose quickly again later that day before seeming to stabilize at between 800 million and 1 billion. Want more data on Uniswap V3 and how it’s being used? You can check out the entire Uniswap V3 dashboard here, and read up on the Uniswap Grant Flipside recently received here.

    "title": "How Nextgen Web3 E-Commerce Platforms Are Revolutionizing the NFT Space",
    "detailedContent": "A $69 million digital artwork or a $100,000 video clip of an NBA basketball play seems insane. Although all of this was unthinkable a few years ago, sales of digital content are breaking records weekly. The reason behind the skyrocketing prices for digital content is none other than the non-fungible token, popularized today under the acronym NFT, which is a digital token generated by blockchain technology. Its properties of authenticity, transparency, immutability and traceability create \"digital scarcity,\" a highly valued attribute by artists, content creators, influencers, musicians and personalities from the highest spheres of entertainment and a driving force behind this new digital movement being called the \"New Digital Age.\" Sales in this incipient Web 3 crypto coins market are already showing signs of maturity, as is reflected in the figures from the main platforms that act as custom-designed marketplaces for various types of NFTs. The future is promising, if we extrapolate the figures collected by sites such as Nonfungible.com, which show the growth in demand for art driven by verified digital scarcity, coinciding with a boom in vendors offering their creations in these marketplaces. \"Sales of non-fungible digital tokens soared to more than $2 billion in the first quarter, more than 20 times the volume of the previous quarter,\" CNBC recently reported, alluding to figures from the latest NonFungible.com report. Even more interesting is the fact that there is an imbalance according to the company between the number of buyers in this market and the sellers, a ratio of just over 2:1. NonFungible.com points out that this difference between supply and demand is \"a sign of massive interest in the newcomers, but also of the desire of the current owners to keep their assets, which generates a phenomenon of scarcity in the market.\" Subscribe Join us in showcasing the cryptocurrency revolution, one newsletter at a time. Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox, along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right, millions love us!) — what are you waiting for? But Why So Much Interest in NFTs? NFTs are digital tokens digitally signed by the creators to designate an official copy of a digital medium, allowing artists, musicians, influencers and even sports franchises to sell their products or creations, which would otherwise have no value. The fundamental reason for the high valuations is that for each sale of an NFT or Web 3 crypto token, the transactions are registered in a shared ledger and distributed on the blockchain on which it is generated (mainly Ethereum), so its public record remains unchanged and, in turn, serves as a kind of certification of authenticity that cannot be altered or erased. Unlike conventional tokens or cryptocurrencies, NFTs are completely unique and not interchangeable with any other asset, hence the concept of non-fungibles. And because of this property of being unique and impossible to replicate, they bridge the gap between the virtual and physical economy, offering a market for valuable digital goods that can be scaled, collected and traded. As demand rises based on these attractive properties, NFTs are providing investors a way to monetize their digital assets collected within the virtual space, which are rapidly growing as more people confined by the COVID-19 pandemic create active digital lives (shopping, gaming, art appreciation and buying, and so on). Driven by these trends, the total value of all NFT transactions increased from $62.8 to $250.8 million in 2020, and is expected to exceed $2 billion in 2021. NFT Market Challenges Despite the amazing growth in the NFT market over the past two quarters, a slowdown is inevitable if NFT platform technology does not catch up. NFT markets face scalability, high gas fees and other technical difficulties. Although sales volumes have been through the roof in Q1-2021, it is worth noting that the NFT market has been showing signs of a recession, especially in the art market, in the last month. The average price of NFTs decreased almost 70% from a peak of around $4,000 in mid-February to around $1,340 in the last few days, generating concern among the main market players such as sellers (creators). Although a fall was inevitable, the truth is that there is an excessive saturation of platforms in the NFT market that is making it difficult for buyers (read fans, investors, collectors) to differentiate and navigate to find the best match. For some specialists, there is an overvaluation in the markets, while for others, it is only a matter of time before people place a higher value on the digital ownership of tokenized assets, that is NFTs. However, for this to happen, it is essential that there is an evolution in the way NFTs are traded, as is the case with dApps in other sectors of the blockchain ecosystem given the demand for use cases and problems inherent in the scalability of first-generation blockchain platforms like Ethereum. Like transactions in the world of cryptocurrencies, NFT creators and traders of all genres have not escaped the high transaction fees or slow speed of transactions that occur on the main platforms. To the above, add that there are limitations in these marketplaces in admitting all types of NFTs under the different standards that have been created both in Ethereum (ERC-721, ERC-1155), and in direct competitors such as Binance (BEP-721, BEP-1155) for example; making the environment even more difficult for a simple deployment for most newbies. When adding to these technical challenges the high entry barriers created by fragmented NFT markets, small companies and entrepreneurs are finding it difficult to promote their own brand to sell, issue and market their NFTs. Scalability to Survive The NFT market needs to solve the above problems inherent in first generation blockchain platforms such as Ethereum. Despite the fact that this blockchain is in the phase of an improvement in its protocol, it is not entirely guaranteed that it will be successful and, as a consequence, support improvements and the sustainability of the markets that revolve around it, such as DeFi, NFT, gaming, and so on. For this reason, we are observing the development of some e-commerce platforms focused on decentralized finance and NFTs on alternative blockchains such as the Binance Smart Chain and Polkadot, each clearly with its respective advantages. Such is the recent case of MocktailSwap Finance on BSC, an AMM-focused DeFi protocol that has launched the first semi-fungible token under the ERC-1155 standard on the Binance Smart Chain, offering more evidence of innovation in the decentralized finance sector. However, complaints of centralization around BSC are a worrying factor for many developers today. On the other hand, it highlights the case of NFTify, a platform focused on e-commerce designed for the digital world, which allows a place to build a market and an influential NFT brand, owing to its association with PolkaFoundry, a hub to create borderless and frictionless DeFi dApps in the Polkadot ecosystem. NFTify enables NFT stores to operate on the converging Polkadot blockchain, benefiting from its scalability and interoperability, as well as leveraging PolkaFoundry\u0027s UX capabilities that make it as easy to develop (or migrate) applications as it is to download and use an Android app, bringing the NFT market to the masses. With its deployment on Polkadot, NFTify promises to revolutionize the NFT market to create, mint and commercialize these “New Age Digital” assets, thanks in large part to the almost infinite technical possibilities that the Polkadot ecosystem allows compared to current blockchain platforms. Faced with a lack of robust marketing channels and thus sales opportunities, the NFT market is anxious to set up shop in a blockchain ecosystem capable of scaling it to a higher level of efficiency and operability, which is in line with the high demand and use cases that the decentralized finance sector is generating.

    "title": "How Does the Delivery of the US$2.4 Billion Option Affect the Market?: TokenInsight",
    "detailedContent": "An Unusual Friday Friday is the weekly derivatives delivery day. Compared with the usual Friday, July 30th, this Friday is not ordinary. Under normal circumstances, the delivery days with larger trading volume tend to be concentrated at the end of the quarter and the end of the half year. The reason is that options are often targeted for a longer period of time, usually monthly, quarterly, or even annual allocation. However, this time is different from the past, in terms of changes in the amount of open interest, there has been a rapid increase in the number of Bitcoin options contracts this week: from last Friday to this Thursday, the open interest in Deribit has increased by 25,810 contracts, the largest weekly increase since mid-April. The notional value of options delivered on July 30 also exceeded US$2.4 billion. The rapid rise of open interest usually occurs before the quarterly delivery, but in normal times, it may be a signal of the activities of \"whales\" (large digital asset market players) and investors who have obtained information in advance. Other signals are also available at this time. It may follow. Comparing annual data, it can be found a similar situation occurred in September last year. And afterwards, the Bitcoin and even the digital asset market ushered in a bull market that lasted until May. The recovery of options and even other derivatives trading enthusiasm seems to herald the improvement of the market in the future. This seems to be a good sign, but not that kind of good. In the past, under the guidance of the macro market, the changes in the open interest of option contracts were often related to the market macro conditions. Therefore, it can be found that the increase in the open interest of option contracts of mainstream digital assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum showed the same trend of \"increase and decrease\". However, this time the contract increment is concentrated on Bitcoin, and the Ethereum contract increment has even declined compared to last week. Is it \"Hot Money\" or Is Market Confidence Back? One possible explanation is that large-scale \"hot money\" is focusing on short-term layout, and the \"gamma squeeze\" caused by short-term layout (for gamma squeeze, please refer to the previous blog \"Warning: Gamma Squeeze\" related explanation ) Large purchases in the spot market have caused the price to rise sharply in a short period of time. This kind of rise is often concentrated on a single asset, lacks support, and is easy to burst in a short period of time. What happened on Ethereum in May is a similar thing. While the increase in Bitcoin contracts fell, the increase in Ethereum contracts rose sharply. At the same time, the price of Ethereum rose to a high of more than $4,000 in a short period of time, and then it was cut in half. The incremental rise of this option contract takes the same form and is similar to it. Judging from the data this week, due to the lack of long-term expectations, it is likely that short-term planners will sell after the option pushes the price up to make a profit. However, judging from the spot market, options are not the only reason for the price increase. The rapid increase in Bitcoin was accompanied by a sharp drop in the exchange wallet balance. According to Bybt, the outflow of bitcoins from major exchanges reached a staggering 175,458.75 in the past week, and most of them were large-scale outflows. The reason is temporarily unknown. The weekly spot purchases caused by the gamma squeeze will not exceed 20,000 Bitcoins, and the outflow of more than 170,000 Bitcoin does not seem to be the effect of the option market. This leads to an interesting inference: the market\u0027s turnaround is guided by the rise of volatility, and the rising volatility is driven by volatility derivatives such as options. After the volatility rises, the market activity increases, triggering spot buying, and finally the market changes from \"virtual bull\" to \"real bull\". This is very different from the traditional market: the volatility in the traditional market is often dominated by the macro level, and the long-term push effect of derivatives on asset prices is not significant. But for the digital asset market, derivatives drive not only prices, but also expectations and confidence. The influence of expectations and confidence in the digital asset market means much more than that of traditional markets. Skewness is one of the important indicators reflecting market confidence. From the perspective of skewness, both the short-term and medium-term skewness have turned positive, and market confidence has recovered significantly. A large number of Bitcoins transferred from exchanges seems to indicate strong spot buying, which means that price increases triggered by fluctuations in the derivatives market ultimately boost market confidence and are beneficial to short-term price trends. But no one knows how long market confidence can last. This article contains links to third-party websites or other content for information purposes only (“Third-Party Sites”).

    "detailedContent": "“Surfing and riding on the top of the wave” would be a better description of this week. Mainstream cryptocurrencies took a huge dive this week, with panic sentiment spread to the retailers. When investors start to turn from bull to bear, Bitcoin’s price surged back to nearly $40,000’s high level, making a “V” and tuning the investors’ mentality. Among the mainstream cryptos, the performance of DOT dazzles this week as we predicted in December 2020. Accumulating enough momentum rallying on Bitcoin, the price of DOT doubled with five times trading volume surging. How long will the “fluctural-bull” remain? What’s the trend of the short- and long-term market? Hints and traces could be found in TokenInsight’s weekly market review.

BTC Jumping Between $30,000 and $40,000 After the price of Bitcoin surpassed $30,000, the market was burnt as hell. It took less than a week to break $40,000 (Jan. 8, 2021), reaching an all-time-high and stabilizing for two days (Jan. 10, 2021). Meanwhile, Ethereum coasted to over $1,300 following the steps of Bitcoin. BTC and ETH price in the last 7 days, chart from 9pm EST, Jan. 14. Source: tokeninsight.com Lots of investors have anticipated the market’s callback, but almost no one realized that this callback is so huge that Bitcoin would fall by more than $8,000 (nearly 20%) in 24 hours, which was close to the $30,000 line at the lowest point. Ethereum also followed the trend and fell below $1,000. The trading volume broke a record on that day: for only the exchanges tracked by TokenInsight, the total daily trading volume of Bitcoin spot and perpetual contracts reached $203.61B, surpassing the weekly trading volume in many periods of last year. BTC perpetual historical trading volume in the last 30 days, chart from 9pm EST, Jan. 14. Source: tokeninsight.com Investors had done some preparations for the fall. Generally speaking, the market\u0027s callback after the holiday bull market is a universal law, for many institutional investors would choose to close their positions at a high level to make profits and sell call options after the vacation, which will lead to an increase in supply and a sharp drop in spot and futures prices. At the same time, a large number of individual investors would also follow the institutional investors to choose to clear out at a high level and wait for the next opportunity to enter the market. 50% + call premium sold from Deribit, chart from Jan. 12. Source: gvol.io But this does not mean that panic did not happen. The huge short-term decline caused a large number of positions owned by futures traders to be liquidated, and the liquidation volume of positions reached the highest point of recent months on Jan. 11. For individual investors, market trends are too complicated to judge: this may mean that the \"March 12\" incident will repeat itself after a year. The skewness of the options market (an indicator that can be used to judge market sentiment) was once below the zero line on Jan. 11, and the bearish sentiment permeated. On the same day, the bit.com options exchange, where individual investors were more concentrated, showed a large number of put options buying volume. 1-hour skew trend in the last 30 days, chart from 9pm EST, Jan. 14.

OKEx, another exchange serving individual investors mainly and owning an options business, showed that on the day of the price plunge, many investors chose to gamble instead. They may have thought that this plunge was just a \"technical adjustment\" and then decided to buy a large number of short-term call options. This time, they were right. The prices of mainstream cryptos rebounded rapidly within three days, and once again returned close to the level before the plunge. OKEx’s options market trading info, chart from Jan. 12. Source: gvol.io To be honest, gambling is not an investment strategy worth boasting about. The huge volatility of the market and the variability of cryptos’ prices mean that any investment in the near future must be carefully judged and considered. Let\u0027s take a look together at what the market might tell us. BTC/ETH/DOT trading volume changes in the last 7 days, chart from 9pm EST, Jan. 12. Source: tokeninsight.com Recent Waves Don’t Mean Long-Term Shock From the perspective of implied volatility and historical volatility, the continuous entanglement of historical volatility and implied volatility starting in January 2021 is not good news. Implied volatility determines the prices of options, and when the historical volatility is higher than the implied volatility, it often indicates that people are unwilling to pay more premiums for future market trends, which in turn reflects poor market sentiment. Furthermore, the entanglement of historical volatility and implied volatility means that investors find it hard to make judgments about the market and are in a mood of uncertainty. Although the prices of mainstream digital assets have rebounded, the trading volume reveals that investors still tend to be cautious in their trading attitudes. Comparison of ETH options’ historical volatility and implied volatility in the last 30 days, chart from 9:00 pm EST, Jan. 14. Source: gvol.io From the perspective of the implied volatility surface, although the curve of options expiring in the short-term appears to be left-skewed (which often means investors are bearish in the short-term), for long-term options, the curve still maintains a right-skewed shape, and similar situations have been going on for months. This means that investors are still optimistic about the long-term of Bitcoin. Despite the recent high volatility, the mainstream attitude of the market still has not changed. From this perspective, long-term investment in bitcoin is still worthwhile. However, investors still need to face crypto price shocks that may last for several weeks. For short-term traders, it is very necessary to adopt a cautious investment attitude in the near future, capture the turmoil from the market and detect and control risks in time. The market is full of volatility, variability,and veers, and this will be a difficult but memorable period for investors.

Though the price of DOT called back a little when Bitcoin dropped this week on Jan. 11, it boosted to $15 on Jan. 15, a 88% increase compared with last week, nearly doubling and reaching its all-time high. The trading volume reached $4.39 billion. Currently, the market capitalization of DOT has surpassed Ripple’s XRP and Litecoin, becoming the fourth ranked crypto asset. As TokenInsight predicted in December 2020, Polkadot hasn’t let the investors down, which reflects a trend that “blue chips” like DOT will become one of the most popular sectors in the crypto market. According to a report posted on Coindesk, some rumors among Asian traders thought Polkadot would become the next EOS, as its value is highly correlated with the popularity and the number of useful applications on the Polkadot chain rather than the market or a Bitcoin rally. Polkadot has actively built its ecosystem during 2020 and it faces challenges like “Ethereum’s supremacy” and opportunities like the app transferring period from ETH 1.0 to Beacon Chain. Qualitative DeFi application needs to emerge during this period for Polkadot to win this serve competition, supporting DeFi’s rise. DOT price in the last 7/30 days, chart from 9pm EST, Jan. 14.

    "detailedContent": "Every week, IntoTheBlock brings you on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. This week, we dive into recent news from traditional companies facilitating crypto transactions. We analyze how these developments are expected to lead to broader adoption of blockchain technology and its significance particularly for Ethereum. The Promising Implications of Payments Adoption on Ethereum Visa announced that it will be supporting payments on Ethereum through the USDC stablecoin. The credit card behemoth already completed its first USDC transaction and will remove the need to convert crypto into fiat for payments. This alone is expected to drive substantial demand for USDC as it facilitates crypto transactions through a more stable medium of exchange. Stablecoins have already captured significant momentum, surpassing $1 trillion in transactions in 2020 alone. Crypto has become increasingly reliant on stablecoins as the most liquid trading pairs are now denominated in stablecoins and a significant portion of activity in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) taking place through these. USDC in particular has grown remarkably in the last two years. Daily transaction volume for USDC settled on Ethereum went from an average of under $20 million in March 2019 to nearly $3.8 billion per day in March 2021. As of Mar. 31, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s USDC network indicators This feat has been achieved with most, if not all, of the activity coming directly from the crypto space. With the advent of Visa moving to support USDC transactions, stablecoin transactions are poised to expand beyond cryptocurrency circles. Being able to easily transact in stablecoins in the real world incentivizes demand for crypto assets and protocols as it removes points of friction, such as having to cash out and withdraw to a bank account. Similarly, Tether published an attestation confirming it has $35 billion worth of assets backing USDT, the largest stablecoin. This push towards greater transparency should also lead to greater adoption as users may become more comfortable as fears of it lacking the necessary reserves settle down. One of the biggest beneficiaries from both of these news is Ethereum. The smart contract platform settles the majority of stablecoin volume, which requires its native Ether token to pay for fees on its blockchain. Furthermore, Ether holders stand to gain from stablecoin adoption with its upcoming EIP 1559 upgrade. For those unfamiliar with EIP 1559, it proposes a new fee structure for Ethereum transactions through which a portion, known as the basefee, is burnt inversely to transaction activity. EIP 1559 could effectively reduce Ether’s supply as transactions grow. Therefore, growing adoption of stablecoins is likely to result in Ether becoming deflationary. Ethereum researcher Justin Drake classifies this transition in Ethereum’s issuance as Ether becoming ultra sound money. Source: Justin Drake Twitter With EIP 1559 set to be implemented in July, Ether holders could soon benefit from all the transaction activity taking place in its blockchain. Despite the current high fees, the number of transactions taking place on Ethereum already averages over 1.2 million per day. As of Mar. 31, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Ethereum network indicators Finally, PayPal announced it will soon allow U.S. users to checkout with crypto. This allows merchants to accept crypto for payments and seamlessly convert it into US dollars. The initial release will support Bitcoin, Ether, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin for payments at its network of 29 million merchants. Needless to say, this should also spur adoption for these crypto-assets beyond speculation. Overall, support from institutions like PayPal and Visa is making it easier to use crypto. As stablecoins become increasingly legitimized, with even federally chartered banks allowed to use and issue them, the long-time promise for crypto mainstream adoption is finally looking closer. Ethereum in particular stands to gain from the recent news. Its upcoming EIP 1559 should create deflationary pressure for Ether and allow it to benefit from its burgeoning NFT and DeFi ecosystem. Ultimately, this aligns interests from Ethereum users and Ether holders, with broader adoption theoretically pushing prices higher due to decreasing supply.

    "detailedContent": "Every week, IntoTheBlock brings you on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. This week we assess the current state of the market following a 20% correction. Specifically, we dive into indicators that have been pointing to high speculative activity, which resulted in vast liquidations as crypto markets crashed. Crypto Markets Crash as Liquidations \u0026 Speculation Abound For the second time this year, crypto markets have experienced a correction of over 20%. While the total market cap of cryptoassets has nearly doubled so far in 2021, it has not necessarily been a smooth ride for investors. As of Feb. 24 via CoinMarketCap The recent crash has been quite similar to the one experienced in early January, with both resulting in a drop of approximately 22% within 48 hours. Notably, although the market managed to recover and continue growing, volatility has been increasing along with it. Bitcoin’s two-month-volatility has been increasing at a steady pace since the fall, reaching the highest level since the period following the Black Thursday crash. As of Feb. 24 through IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin Financial Analytics The increase in volatility is arguably tied to the growth in speculative activity in crypto markets. At IntoTheBlock, we have been pointing to the increase in short-term activity as one of the key insights of the bull market. The number of addresses holding Bitcoin for under one month — classified by IntoTheBlock as traders — reached record highs in February. This metric points to high amounts of speculation and short-term trading taking place over the past few months based on blockchain data. As of Feb. 24 through IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin Ownership Indicators The significant amount of short-term trading suggests a large number of traders have been chasing Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Moreover, while the number of addresses grew by almost 20% in the last 30 days, the volume decreased by 5%, meaning that there was a capital outflow despite the growth in traders. Another key metric reflective of the amount of speculative activity taking place is the volume of liquidations. Since derivatives traders typically use leverage for their positions, they also face the risk of getting liquidated if the value of their positions drop past the limits on their margin account. Perhaps unsurprisingly, crypto markets encountered billions worth of liquidations in the recent crash. As of Feb. 24 via TheBlock Although both the correction experienced in January and this week’s correction were of approximately 22%, the magnitude of the liquidations taking place were significantly higher in the latter. The increase in liquidations point to more value being at stake in the recent crash, potentially due to higher leverage being taken from traders. (Unfortunately, centralized exchanges do not publicly state how the leverage taken by its traders varies through time). In decentralized finance (DeFi), we observe a similar trend. Liquidations in the lending protocol Compound reached the second highest ever on Feb. 23. As of Feb. 24 through IntoTheBlock’s Compound Protocol Indicators The $87.8 million worth of liquidations on Tuesday is more than had been liquidated the entire month. This further demonstrates the high leverage traders had been taking on prior to the crash. Overall, the correction crypto markets just experienced has led to deleveraging of traders that had been highly speculative. Following a year-to-date growth of over 100%, this correction is “healthy” for the markets as short-term activity settles after sizable liquidations.

    "title": "All About Compound: Flipside Crypto",
    "detailedContent": "We take a look at Compound — the lending and borrowing protocol built on Ethereum. How Does Compound Work? Like most decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, Compound is a system of openly accessible smart contracts built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows borrowers (in green) to take out loans by depositing collateral. At the same time, it allows lenders (Compound refers to these users as “suppliers”) to earn interest on their loan. Both parties can trust the code to enforce the payment of interest by the borrowers by the lenders. So unlike traditional finance, in DeFi there is no KYC, no sign-up,and no middleman. cTokens Compound also allows lenders to actively trade their interest earned, without taking out their deposited liquidity. This means lenders can continue to earn interest while trading that interest in other protocols and earn more. Compound does this by tokenizing your deposit into cTokens. When a supplier (in blue) provides liquidity to Compound, in the form of USDC for example, they receive an equivalent amount of cUSDC. While the USDC has to stay locked in Compound, the cUSDC can be transacted and staked elsewhere. The exchange rate between the token deposited and the cToken will only get more favorable over time, as a way to incentivize liquidity providers to keep their funds in Compound longer. It starts at 0.020000 for all markets, meaning 1 cUSDC is worth 0.020000 USDC when you first deposit liquidity. After 100 days the exchange rate gets more favorable, at which point exchanging 1 cUSDC might get you 0.021591 USDC for example. Liquidators Liquidators are the users who seize assets from other users who have taken on more of a loan balance than Compound considers them entitled to. This is most often tied to the amount of collateral the user has supplied, which determines how much they can borrow. If a borrower ends up going over their limit, liquidators can seize a portion of their collateral for good. Compound constantly checks what the borrowers’ loan balances are. Compound accrues interest on loan balances which are expected to go up over time. The Comptroller The Comptroller creates and maintains markets on Compound. It is this contract that controls the supply of the cTokens available to each market. Governance COMP is Compound’s governance token, which means users who own it have a right to vote on governance proposals. COMP owners can also delegate their right to vote to any other wallet address. 42 proposals have been put forth so far. COMP can be bought on most crypto exchanges, and the foundation has also given some out for specific events. Fun Fact: 441 million USDC has been deposited in Compound so far. And the top three assets being deposited are ETH, DAI and USDC. API Access This article contains links to third-party websites or other content for information purposes only (“Third-Party Sites”).

    "title": "DeFi Continues Blistering Growth in February: Flipside Crypto",
    "detailedContent": "Who Is In, Who Is Out? Members of the Fundamental Asset Score (FCAS) 25 are reevaluated each month and must be ranked within the top 25 for at least 40 days to qualify. The FCAS is a comparative metric that evaluates the fundamental health of a crypto project, and the FCAS 25 is a weighted moving average of the top 25 projects that aims to show the overall health of the crypto industry. The notable newcomer to the March rankings is Balancer (BAL), which broke into the Top 25 to reach a rank of 14 as of Mar. 1. Ripple (XRP) dropped out of the Top 25 amid continuing uncertainty around the SEC lawsuit. Overall industry health can be assessed by taking the average FCAS of the 25 top projects. This overall industry health metric works as a good proxy for how the industry is doing as a whole. In the last month, the average FCAS score increased 5 points. Figure 1. Overall Industry Health February Witnesses Impressive DeFi Growth Though decentralized finance (DeFi) is by no means a new phenomenon, February witnessed impressive activity in the DeFi space. A number of DeFi protocols witnessed record monthly revenues, as did the overall DeFi space — to the tune of $171.5 million, according to research from The Block. Transaction volume continued unabated, as seen below in Figure 2. Figure 2. Ethereum Transactions by Transaction Type The dark blue bars reflect the rise in DeFi transactions since summer 2020 FCAS scores reflect the recent DeFi activity and are sensitive to accelerated developer activity in a number of major projects. While token price and liquidity garner the majority of headlines, active developer contributions are one of the strongest signals of healthy DeFi projects. Balancer is one clear example of that. Balancer-Aave Collaboration Pays Dividends for FCAS Score Balancer is an automated market maker (AMM) designed to facilitate the exchange of ERC-20 assets. It differentiates itself from other AMMs by means of a constant mean formula, designed to facilitate multiple assets and asset weightings other than 50-50 pairings. Balancer made crypto news recently when its CEO, Fernando Martinelli, announced a collaboration with Aave, known as the Balancer V2 Asset Manager. This partnership will enable assets in Balancer pools to earn yield in Aave. Enabling this type of partnership requires a lot of developer work. We see this reflected in Balancer’s code contributions over the past month, visible in the bottom right of Figure 3: Figure 3. Code Contributions at Balancer After a lull in December and early January (coders taking time off for the holidays, perhaps?), Balancer’s codebase saw a spate of activity. While it’s impossible to know for sure, it is reasonable to assume that this activity was related to the AAVE collaboration and the dev work necessary to make it go. As evidence, take a look at the recent rise in Aave’s developer score and overall FCAS score. Both scores go up significantly, which supports the hypothesis that Aave was working on something big during the same time period as Balancer. Figure 4. Aave - FCAS Score and Developer Score Over the past month, Balancer scores highly on user activity and does well in terms of market maturity, but neither metric changed substantially in February. However, Balancer’s developer activity rose significantly enough to propel the project’s overall FCAS score into the top 25. Figure 5. Balancer - User Activity Score and Market Maturity Score Figure 5. Balancer’s Overall FCAS Score Since the start of the year, Balancer’s project health as measured by FCAS has been on a steady climb, due primarily to the activity of its developer community Aave: Coming Soon? As we have seen, Aave’s developer community was just as active in February as Balancer’s. Barring a severe reversal, we expect this increased activity to result in Aave’s appearance on the FCAS 25 list next month. The FCAS methodology rewards consistency: demonstrating project health via high performance in successive months is necessary to earn inclusion in the FCAS 25. In other words, the very best crypto projects don’t just reach the top of the mountain — they tend to stay there.

    "title": "What\u0027s New on CoinMarketCap?",
    "detailedContent": "CoinMarketCap\u0027s 2021 Q1 Recap 2021 was off to an inauspicious start, with a relatively confused atmosphere and the uncertainties of the pandemic and a continuous lockdown in many parts of the world. However, 2021 also welcomed some positive events. In the crypto world, we witnessed the ATHs for Bitcoin, Ethereum and many more coins, and we also witnessed the surprising high auction price for a NFT art piece by Beeple! With this crypto fever continuing, the CoinMarketCap team was keeping busy and tried very hard to deliver features that you’ve long asked for! It’s always good to look back on what we have achieved, and hopefully you are now enjoying all the new things we’ve provided to you! Enhancements on CoinMarketCap\u0027s Website In Q1 2021, we delivered a few important products, including: 1. Enhanced watchlist Our watchlist feature has always been a long loved product. We didn’t think merging the portfolio feature with watchlist would be a good idea; instead, we put in more thoughts into how to make it a more powerful tool for everyone. We expanded the functionality of the CoinMarketCap watchlist in the following ways: Enabled multiple watchlists for every user; Added the public watchlist feature for users to share their own investment ideas; Added the ability to follow others’ watchlists and get some ideas of coins/ tokens to watch for; Added a leaderboard of public watchlist and ranked the most popular watchlists. 2. Customized homepage We know that you have been asking us to add lots of different data items, but our homepage is not big enough to accommodate everyone’s requests. Therefore, we thought of a solution, which was to provide more data items and let you decide how your homepage should look! With our auto-refreshed data and your own customized homepage, we believe you can make the best choice for your next investment. 3. New filtering With more and more projects listed on CoinMarketCap, and more and more different types of projects, it’s hard to keep up with all the new coins or tokens added in the specific type of cryptocurrencies you care about. We made a good cleanup with all the projects’ tags and added the new filtering criteria. Now you can filter by category (e.g. Collectibles \u0026 NFT, DeFi, etc), algorithm (e.g. PoS, PoW, PoC or more), platform (e.g. Ethereum, BSC, Polkadot and more) or industry (like gambling, memes, etc). Plus all the good criteria we used to provide (such as filtering by price change, volume, etc), you can get a nice and really targeted list of coins/tokens. 4. Category ranking and category pages You might want to watch from the coin/token level, but have you thought about monitoring performances of a specific crypto category? We provide you with a new category ranking page that you can see the aggregated performance of different crypto sectors. You can also view what coins belong to that category very easily by clicking the category name, or simply click on the different tags on the coin page. 5. ICO Calendar Still have a lack of investment ideas? There are some new projects which might attract your attention and if you want to get to the front seat, you’ll definitely need to get in quickly! We provided an overview of ICO events on the new ICO calendar page, easier to find good new projects to invest in or to understand what’s going on in the crypto world. We’ve also listed these ICO tokens before they are released, so you can put them in your watchlist from an earlier stage. Other enhancements on the coin detail page include the following: Integrated with TradingView chart; Added Wallets tab; Added total value locked (TVL), Market Cap/TVL Ratio, and Volume/Market Cap ratio; Added MetaMask link; Added Dextool link. Enhancements of the CoinMarketCap Mobile App The CoinMarketCap website isn’t the only thing that saw lots of progress in Q1 — the CoinMarketCap mobile app has become even more useful for checking the prices of crypto and more, right from your pocket. 1. Enhanced watchlist We brought our enhanced watchlist feature from the website to our mobile app as well. Mobile app users can sync their watchlist between devices and take it with them on the go! You get all of the same new features like multiple watchlists, shareable watchlists and the ability to follow popular lists all on your mobile device. 2. Portfolio enhancements Based on feedback from our community, we made the following adjustments to our portfolio: Price auto refresh on the portfolio page, so you always have the latest prices. We brought back the option to view your portfolio balance in your default fiat currency and default cryptocurrency. Simply tap your portfolio balance to toggle back and forth. 3. To further our mission of showcasing the crypto revolution to the world, we translated our Android app into eight new languages! German Indonesian Japanese Korean Spanish Thai Turkish Vietnamese Android users can now select their preferred language from the language menu on the settings page. Other updates View token contract address on coin details page and link to meta mask on the coin details pages To keep up with the latest trends, we added new sections on the Sectors tab for Polkadot Ecosystem, Binance Smart Chain Ecosystem and NFTs \u0026 Collectibles. Use these pages to track the trending tokens in each sector and the largest sectors by market cap. We hope to see you soon, checking out all our new features, on CoinMarketCap!",

    "title": "Swap With MDEX on CoinMarketCap",
    "detailedContent": "Earlier this month, CoinMarketCap made it possible for our users to swap tokens right on our site. Before, you could only check the price of a token on CoinMarketCap before going elsewhere to swap — we’ve made it even easier for you by putting swaps right where you check your prices. You no longer will have to navigate away from CoinMarketCap’s price page, perhaps losing valuable seconds before you make your swap — and as we know, every second counts in crypto! With the addition of MDEX swapping on CoinMarketCap, users can swap tokens using both Uniswap and MDEX, two of the most popular exchanges on CoinMarketCap. For every supported network and token, you will be able to connect your supported crypto wallet and start swapping in a safe and secure way. What Is MDEX? MDEX is a decentralized trading protocol, launched in January 2021, that operates with the concept of fund pools. As an automated market maker (AMM), MDEX uses a dual-chain model on both the Ethereum network and the Huobi Ecological Chain (HECO). MDEX claims to support a confirmation time of about three seconds, as well as low gas fees, due to the dual-chain model that takes advantage of the best parts of both the ETH and HECO networks. What Networks, Wallets and DEXs Does CoinMarketCap Token Swap Support? Below is a list of the currently supported DEXs, wallets and networks for CoinMarketCap’s token swaps. Supported DEXs Uniswap and MDEX. Supported Wallets At this time, wallets supported by Uniswap and MDEX will also be available for the CoinMarketCap token swap. Uniswap: MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet, Fortmatic and Portis for Uniswap swapping. MDEX: MetaMask, TrustWallet, MathWallet, TokenPocket, WalletConnect and SafePal Wallet for MDEX swapping. Supported Networks Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain and HECO are the networks supported at this time. How to Use Token Swaps on CoinMarketCap First, navigate to the page of the coin that you wish to swap. You will see a converter between a selection of two coins on the right side of the page, and the option to “Swap on CoinMarketCap.” Once you click to swap, you will be able to select the cryptos that you wish to swap and the amount. At this point, you will need to connect a wallet and sign the blockchain transaction. Make sure that you have checked the liquidity provider fee that will be charged, the route, the price impact, the minimum received and the slippage tolerance before confirming your swap.

All this week, we’ll be taking a closer look at the data behind Uniswap V3 as we work to build the world’s best dashboard. You can join us, and earn 500UNI, by contributing a question that makes it to our dashboard. Just join us on Discord to get started! We’ll get started this week by taking a look at the TVL — or total value locked — of Uniswap V3. Total value locked represents the amount of assets that are currently being staked in a specific protocol. As you can see in the chart below, Uniswap V3 TVL hit its current all-time high at roughly midday Eastern Time in the U.S. on Friday, May 14, as total liquidity topped 1 billion at 11 AM and remained over that milestone for roughly 2 hours before dropping — hard. By 2 PM the same day, TVL had fallen to just over 750 million, its lowest level in roughly two days. TVL rose quickly again later that day before seeming to stabilize at between 800 million and 1 billion. Want more data on Uniswap V3 and how it’s being used? You can check out the entire Uniswap V3 dashboard here, and read up on the Uniswap Grant Flipside recently received here.

    "detailedContent": "A $69 million digital artwork or a $100,000 video clip of an NBA basketball play seems insane. Although all of this was unthinkable a few years ago, sales of digital content are breaking records weekly. The reason behind the skyrocketing prices for digital content is none other than the non-fungible token, popularized today under the acronym NFT, which is a digital token generated by blockchain technology. Its properties of authenticity, transparency, immutability and traceability create \"digital scarcity,\" a highly valued attribute by artists, content creators, influencers, musicians and personalities from the highest spheres of entertainment and a driving force behind this new digital movement being called the \"New Digital Age.\" Sales in this incipient Web 3 crypto coins market are already showing signs of maturity, as is reflected in the figures from the main platforms that act as custom-designed marketplaces for various types of NFTs. The future is promising, if we extrapolate the figures collected by sites such as Nonfungible.com, which show the growth in demand for art driven by verified digital scarcity, coinciding with a boom in vendors offering their creations in these marketplaces. \"Sales of non-fungible digital tokens soared to more than $2 billion in the first quarter, more than 20 times the volume of the previous quarter,\" CNBC recently reported, alluding to figures from the latest NonFungible.com report. Even more interesting is the fact that there is an imbalance according to the company between the number of buyers in this market and the sellers, a ratio of just over 2:1. NonFungible.com points out that this difference between supply and demand is \"a sign of massive interest in the newcomers, but also of the desire of the current owners to keep their assets, which generates a phenomenon of scarcity in the market.\" Subscribe Join us in showcasing the cryptocurrency revolution, one newsletter at a time. Subscribe now to get daily news and market updates right to your inbox, along with our millions of other subscribers (that’s right, millions love us!) — what are you waiting for? But Why So Much Interest in NFTs? NFTs are digital tokens digitally signed by the creators to designate an official copy of a digital medium, allowing artists, musicians, influencers and even sports franchises to sell their products or creations, which would otherwise have no value. The fundamental reason for the high valuations is that for each sale of an NFT or Web 3 crypto token, the transactions are registered in a shared ledger and distributed on the blockchain on which it is generated (mainly Ethereum), so its public record remains unchanged and, in turn, serves as a kind of certification of authenticity that cannot be altered or erased. Unlike conventional tokens or cryptocurrencies, NFTs are completely unique and not interchangeable with any other asset, hence the concept of non-fungibles. And because of this property of being unique and impossible to replicate, they bridge the gap between the virtual and physical economy, offering a market for valuable digital goods that can be scaled, collected and traded. As demand rises based on these attractive properties, NFTs are providing investors a way to monetize their digital assets collected within the virtual space, which are rapidly growing as more people confined by the COVID-19 pandemic create active digital lives (shopping, gaming, art appreciation and buying, and so on). Driven by these trends, the total value of all NFT transactions increased from $62.8 to $250.8 million in 2020, and is expected to exceed $2 billion in 2021. NFT Market Challenges Despite the amazing growth in the NFT market over the past two quarters, a slowdown is inevitable if NFT platform technology does not catch up. NFT markets face scalability, high gas fees and other technical difficulties. Although sales volumes have been through the roof in Q1-2021, it is worth noting that the NFT market has been showing signs of a recession, especially in the art market, in the last month. The average price of NFTs decreased almost 70% from a peak of around $4,000 in mid-February to around $1,340 in the last few days, generating concern among the main market players such as sellers (creators). Although a fall was inevitable, the truth is that there is an excessive saturation of platforms in the NFT market that is making it difficult for buyers (read fans, investors, collectors) to differentiate and navigate to find the best match. For some specialists, there is an overvaluation in the markets, while for others, it is only a matter of time before people place a higher value on the digital ownership of tokenized assets, that is NFTs. However, for this to happen, it is essential that there is an evolution in the way NFTs are traded, as is the case with dApps in other sectors of the blockchain ecosystem given the demand for use cases and problems inherent in the scalability of first-generation blockchain platforms like Ethereum. Like transactions in the world of cryptocurrencies, NFT creators and traders of all genres have not escaped the high transaction fees or slow speed of transactions that occur on the main platforms. To the above, add that there are limitations in these marketplaces in admitting all types of NFTs under the different standards that have been created both in Ethereum (ERC-721, ERC-1155), and in direct competitors such as Binance (BEP-721, BEP-1155) for example; making the environment even more difficult for a simple deployment for most newbies. When adding to these technical challenges the high entry barriers created by fragmented NFT markets, small companies and entrepreneurs are finding it difficult to promote their own brand to sell, issue and market their NFTs. Scalability to Survive The NFT market needs to solve the above problems inherent in first generation blockchain platforms such as Ethereum. Despite the fact that this blockchain is in the phase of an improvement in its protocol, it is not entirely guaranteed that it will be successful and, as a consequence, support improvements and the sustainability of the markets that revolve around it, such as DeFi, NFT, gaming, and so on. For this reason, we are observing the development of some e-commerce platforms focused on decentralized finance and NFTs on alternative blockchains such as the Binance Smart Chain and Polkadot, each clearly with its respective advantages. Such is the recent case of MocktailSwap Finance on BSC, an AMM-focused DeFi protocol that has launched the first semi-fungible token under the ERC-1155 standard on the Binance Smart Chain, offering more evidence of innovation in the decentralized finance sector. However, complaints of centralization around BSC are a worrying factor for many developers today. On the other hand, it highlights the case of NFTify, a platform focused on e-commerce designed for the digital world, which allows a place to build a market and an influential NFT brand, owing to its association with PolkaFoundry, a hub to create borderless and frictionless DeFi dApps in the Polkadot ecosystem. NFTify enables NFT stores to operate on the converging Polkadot blockchain, benefiting from its scalability and interoperability, as well as leveraging PolkaFoundry\u0027s UX capabilities that make it as easy to develop (or migrate) applications as it is to download and use an Android app, bringing the NFT market to the masses. With its deployment on Polkadot, NFTify promises to revolutionize the NFT market to create, mint and commercialize these “New Age Digital” assets, thanks in large part to the almost infinite technical possibilities that the Polkadot ecosystem allows compared to current blockchain platforms. Faced with a lack of robust marketing channels and thus sales opportunities, the NFT market is anxious to set up shop in a blockchain ecosystem capable of scaling it to a higher level of efficiency and operability, which is in line with the high demand and use cases that the decentralized finance sector is generating.

    "summary": "This week, TokenInsight takes a look at what is going on with Bitcoin now.",
    "title": "How Does the Delivery of the US$2.4 Billion Option Affect the Market?: TokenInsight",
    "detailedContent": "An Unusual Friday Friday is the weekly derivatives delivery day. Compared with the usual Friday, July 30th, this Friday is not ordinary. Under normal circumstances, the delivery days with larger trading volume tend to be concentrated at the end of the quarter and the end of the half year. The reason is that options are often targeted for a longer period of time, usually monthly, quarterly, or even annual allocation. However, this time is different from the past, in terms of changes in the amount of open interest, there has been a rapid increase in the number of Bitcoin options contracts this week: from last Friday to this Thursday, the open interest in Deribit has increased by 25,810 contracts, the largest weekly increase since mid-April. The notional value of options delivered on July 30 also exceeded US$2.4 billion. The rapid rise of open interest usually occurs before the quarterly delivery, but in normal times, it may be a signal of the activities of \"whales\" (large digital asset market players) and investors who have obtained information in advance. Other signals are also available at this time. It may follow. Comparing annual data, it can be found a similar situation occurred in September last year. And afterwards, the Bitcoin and even the digital asset market ushered in a bull market that lasted until May. The recovery of options and even other derivatives trading enthusiasm seems to herald the improvement of the market in the future. This seems to be a good sign, but not that kind of good. In the past, under the guidance of the macro market, the changes in the open interest of option contracts were often related to the market macro conditions. Therefore, it can be found that the increase in the open interest of option contracts of mainstream digital assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum showed the same trend of \"increase and decrease\". However, this time the contract increment is concentrated on Bitcoin, and the Ethereum contract increment has even declined compared to last week. Is it \"Hot Money\" or Is Market Confidence Back? One possible explanation is that large-scale \"hot money\" is focusing on short-term layout, and the \"gamma squeeze\" caused by short-term layout (for gamma squeeze, please refer to the previous blog \"Warning: Gamma Squeeze\" related explanation ) Large purchases in the spot market have caused the price to rise sharply in a short period of time. This kind of rise is often concentrated on a single asset, lacks support, and is easy to burst in a short period of time. What happened on Ethereum in May is a similar thing. While the increase in Bitcoin contracts fell, the increase in Ethereum contracts rose sharply. At the same time, the price of Ethereum rose to a high of more than $4,000 in a short period of time, and then it was cut in half. The incremental rise of this option contract takes the same form and is similar to it. Judging from the data this week, due to the lack of long-term expectations, it is likely that short-term planners will sell after the option pushes the price up to make a profit. However, judging from the spot market, options are not the only reason for the price increase. The rapid increase in Bitcoin was accompanied by a sharp drop in the exchange wallet balance. According to Bybt, the outflow of bitcoins from major exchanges reached a staggering 175,458.75 in the past week, and most of them were large-scale outflows. The reason is temporarily unknown. The weekly spot purchases caused by the gamma squeeze will not exceed 20,000 Bitcoins, and the outflow of more than 170,000 Bitcoin does not seem to be the effect of the option market. This leads to an interesting inference: the market\u0027s turnaround is guided by the rise of volatility, and the rising volatility is driven by volatility derivatives such as options. After the volatility rises, the market activity increases, triggering spot buying, and finally the market changes from \"virtual bull\" to \"real bull\". This is very different from the traditional market: the volatility in the traditional market is often dominated by the macro level, and the long-term push effect of derivatives on asset prices is not significant. But for the digital asset market, derivatives drive not only prices, but also expectations and confidence. The influence of expectations and confidence in the digital asset market means much more than that of traditional markets. Skewness is one of the important indicators reflecting market confidence. From the perspective of skewness, both the short-term and medium-term skewness have turned positive, and market confidence has recovered significantly. A large number of Bitcoins transferred from exchanges seems to indicate strong spot buying, which means that price increases triggered by fluctuations in the derivatives market ultimately boost market confidence and are beneficial to short-term price trends. But no one knows how long market confidence can last. This article contains links to third-party websites or other content for information purposes only (“Third-Party Sites”).

When investors start to turn from bull to bear, Bitcoin’s price surged back to nearly $40,000’s high level, making a “V” and tuning the investors’ mentality. Among the mainstream cryptos, the performance of DOT dazzles this week as we predicted in December 2020. Accumulating enough momentum rallying on Bitcoin, the price of DOT doubled with five times trading volume surging. How long will the “fluctural-bull” remain?

Source: tokeninsight.com Lots of investors have anticipated the market’s callback, but almost no one realized that this callback is so huge that Bitcoin would fall by more than $8,000 (nearly 20%) in 24 hours, which was close to the $30,000 line at the lowest point. Ethereum also followed the trend and fell below $1,000. The trading volume broke a record on that day: for only the exchanges tracked by TokenInsight, the total daily trading volume of Bitcoin spot and perpetual contracts reached $203.61B, surpassing the weekly trading volume in many periods of last year.

Generally speaking, the market\u0027s callback after the holiday bull market is a universal law, for many institutional investors would choose to close their positions at a high level to make profits and sell call options after the vacation, which will lead to an increase in supply and a sharp drop in spot and futures prices. At the same time, a large number of individual investors would also follow the institutional investors to choose to clear out at a high level and wait for the next opportunity to enter the market. 50% + call premium sold from Deribit, chart from Jan. 12.

The huge short-term decline caused a large number of positions owned by futures traders to be liquidated, and the liquidation volume of positions reached the highest point of recent months on Jan. 11. For individual investors, market trends are too complicated to judge: this may mean that the \"March 12\" incident will repeat itself after a year. The skewness of the options market (an indicator that can be used to judge market sentiment) was once below the zero line on Jan. 11, and the bearish sentiment permeated. On the same day, the bit.com options exchange, where individual investors were more concentrated, showed a large number of put options buying volume. 1-hour skew trend in the last 30 days, chart from 9pm EST, Jan. 14.

OKEx, another exchange serving individual investors mainly and owning an options business, showed that on the day of the price plunge, many investors chose to gamble instead. They may have thought that this plunge was just a \"technical adjustment\" and then decided to buy a large number of short-term call options. This time, they were right. The prices of mainstream cryptos rebounded rapidly within three days, and once again returned close to the level before the plunge. OKEx’s options market trading info, chart from Jan. 12.

The huge volatility of the market and the variability of cryptos’ prices mean that any investment in the near future must be carefully judged and considered. Let\u0027s take a look together at what the market might tell us. BTC/ETH/DOT trading volume changes in the last 7 days, chart from 9pm EST, Jan. 12. Source: tokeninsight.com Recent Waves Don’t Mean Long-Term Shock From the perspective of implied volatility and historical volatility, the continuous entanglement of historical volatility and implied volatility starting in January 2021 is not good news. Implied volatility determines the prices of options, and when the historical volatility is higher than the implied volatility, it often indicates that people are unwilling to pay more premiums for future market trends, which in turn reflects poor market sentiment. Furthermore, the entanglement of historical volatility and implied volatility means that investors find it hard to make judgments about the market and are in a mood of uncertainty. Although the prices of mainstream digital assets have rebounded, the trading volume reveals that investors still tend to be cautious in their trading attitudes. Comparison of ETH options’ historical volatility and implied volatility in the last 30 days, chart from 9:00 pm EST, Jan. 14. Source: gvol.io From the perspective of the implied volatility surface, although the curve of options expiring in the short-term appears to be left-skewed (which often means investors are bearish in the short-term), for long-term options, the curve still maintains a right-skewed shape, and similar situations have been going on for months. This means that investors are still optimistic about the long-term of Bitcoin. Despite the recent high volatility, the mainstream attitude of the market still has not changed. From this perspective, long-term investment in bitcoin is still worthwhile. However, investors still need to face crypto price shocks that may last for several weeks. For short-term traders, it is very necessary to adopt a cautious investment attitude in the near future, capture the turmoil from the market and detect and control risks in time. The market is full of volatility, variability,and veers, and this will be a difficult but memorable period for investors.

Though the price of DOT called back a little when Bitcoin dropped this week on Jan. 11, it boosted to $15 on Jan. 15, a 88% increase compared with last week, nearly doubling and reaching its all-time high. The trading volume reached $4.39 billion. Currently, the market capitalization of DOT has surpassed Ripple’s XRP and Litecoin, becoming the fourth ranked crypto asset. As TokenInsight predicted in December 2020, Polkadot hasn’t let the investors down, which reflects a trend that “blue chips” like DOT will become one of the most popular sectors in the crypto market. According to a report posted on Coindesk, some rumors among Asian traders thought Polkadot would become the next EOS, as its value is highly correlated with the popularity and the number of useful applications on the Polkadot chain rather than the market or a Bitcoin rally. Polkadot has actively built its ecosystem during 2020 and it faces challenges like “Ethereum’s supremacy” and opportunities like the app transferring period from ETH 1.0 to Beacon Chain. Qualitative DeFi application needs to emerge during this period for Polkadot to win this serve competition, supporting DeFi’s rise. DOT price in the last 7/30 days, chart from 9pm EST, Jan. 14.

    "detailedContent": "Every week, IntoTheBlock brings you on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. This week, we dive into recent news from traditional companies facilitating crypto transactions. We analyze how these developments are expected to lead to broader adoption of blockchain technology and its significance particularly for Ethereum. The Promising Implications of Payments Adoption on Ethereum Visa announced that it will be supporting payments on Ethereum through the USDC stablecoin. The credit card behemoth already completed its first USDC transaction and will remove the need to convert crypto into fiat for payments. This alone is expected to drive substantial demand for USDC as it facilitates crypto transactions through a more stable medium of exchange. Stablecoins have already captured significant momentum, surpassing $1 trillion in transactions in 2020 alone. Crypto has become increasingly reliant on stablecoins as the most liquid trading pairs are now denominated in stablecoins and a significant portion of activity in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) taking place through these. USDC in particular has grown remarkably in the last two years. Daily transaction volume for USDC settled on Ethereum went from an average of under $20 million in March 2019 to nearly $3.8 billion per day in March 2021. As of Mar. 31, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s USDC network indicators This feat has been achieved with most, if not all, of the activity coming directly from the crypto space. With the advent of Visa moving to support USDC transactions, stablecoin transactions are poised to expand beyond cryptocurrency circles. Being able to easily transact in stablecoins in the real world incentivizes demand for crypto assets and protocols as it removes points of friction, such as having to cash out and withdraw to a bank account. Similarly, Tether published an attestation confirming it has $35 billion worth of assets backing USDT, the largest stablecoin. This push towards greater transparency should also lead to greater adoption as users may become more comfortable as fears of it lacking the necessary reserves settle down. One of the biggest beneficiaries from both of these news is Ethereum. The smart contract platform settles the majority of stablecoin volume, which requires its native Ether token to pay for fees on its blockchain. Furthermore, Ether holders stand to gain from stablecoin adoption with its upcoming EIP 1559 upgrade. For those unfamiliar with EIP 1559, it proposes a new fee structure for Ethereum transactions through which a portion, known as the basefee, is burnt inversely to transaction activity. EIP 1559 could effectively reduce Ether’s supply as transactions grow. Therefore, growing adoption of stablecoins is likely to result in Ether becoming deflationary. Ethereum researcher Justin Drake classifies this transition in Ethereum’s issuance as Ether becoming ultra sound money. Source: Justin Drake Twitter With EIP 1559 set to be implemented in July, Ether holders could soon benefit from all the transaction activity taking place in its blockchain. Despite the current high fees, the number of transactions taking place on Ethereum already averages over 1.2 million per day. As of Mar. 31, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Ethereum network indicators Finally, PayPal announced it will soon allow U.S. users to checkout with crypto. This allows merchants to accept crypto for payments and seamlessly convert it into US dollars. The initial release will support Bitcoin, Ether, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin for payments at its network of 29 million merchants. Needless to say, this should also spur adoption for these crypto-assets beyond speculation. Overall, support from institutions like PayPal and Visa is making it easier to use crypto. As stablecoins become increasingly legitimized, with even federally chartered banks allowed to use and issue them, the long-time promise for crypto mainstream adoption is finally looking closer. Ethereum in particular stands to gain from the recent news. Its upcoming EIP 1559 should create deflationary pressure for Ether and allow it to benefit from its burgeoning NFT and DeFi ecosystem. Ultimately, this aligns interests from Ethereum users and Ether holders, with broader adoption theoretically pushing prices higher due to decreasing supply.

    "detailedContent": "Every week, IntoTheBlock brings you on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. This week we assess the current state of the market following a 20% correction. Specifically, we dive into indicators that have been pointing to high speculative activity, which resulted in vast liquidations as crypto markets crashed. Crypto Markets Crash as Liquidations \u0026 Speculation Abound For the second time this year, crypto markets have experienced a correction of over 20%. While the total market cap of cryptoassets has nearly doubled so far in 2021, it has not necessarily been a smooth ride for investors. As of Feb. 24 via CoinMarketCap The recent crash has been quite similar to the one experienced in early January, with both resulting in a drop of approximately 22% within 48 hours. Notably, although the market managed to recover and continue growing, volatility has been increasing along with it. Bitcoin’s two-month-volatility has been increasing at a steady pace since the fall, reaching the highest level since the period following the Black Thursday crash. As of Feb. 24 through IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin Financial Analytics The increase in volatility is arguably tied to the growth in speculative activity in crypto markets. At IntoTheBlock, we have been pointing to the increase in short-term activity as one of the key insights of the bull market. The number of addresses holding Bitcoin for under one month — classified by IntoTheBlock as traders — reached record highs in February. This metric points to high amounts of speculation and short-term trading taking place over the past few months based on blockchain data. As of Feb. 24 through IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin Ownership Indicators The significant amount of short-term trading suggests a large number of traders have been chasing Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Moreover, while the number of addresses grew by almost 20% in the last 30 days, the volume decreased by 5%, meaning that there was a capital outflow despite the growth in traders. Another key metric reflective of the amount of speculative activity taking place is the volume of liquidations. Since derivatives traders typically use leverage for their positions, they also face the risk of getting liquidated if the value of their positions drop past the limits on their margin account. Perhaps unsurprisingly, crypto markets encountered billions worth of liquidations in the recent crash. As of Feb. 24 via TheBlock Although both the correction experienced in January and this week’s correction were of approximately 22%, the magnitude of the liquidations taking place were significantly higher in the latter. The increase in liquidations point to more value being at stake in the recent crash, potentially due to higher leverage being taken from traders. (Unfortunately, centralized exchanges do not publicly state how the leverage taken by its traders varies through time). In decentralized finance (DeFi), we observe a similar trend. Liquidations in the lending protocol Compound reached the second highest ever on Feb. 23. As of Feb. 24 through IntoTheBlock’s Compound Protocol Indicators The $87.8 million worth of liquidations on Tuesday is more than had been liquidated the entire month. This further demonstrates the high leverage traders had been taking on prior to the crash. Overall, the correction crypto markets just experienced has led to deleveraging of traders that had been highly speculative. Following a year-to-date growth of over 100%, this correction is “healthy” for the markets as short-term activity settles after sizable liquidations.

    "title": "All About Compound: Flipside Crypto",
    "detailedContent": "We take a look at Compound — the lending and borrowing protocol built on Ethereum. How Does Compound Work? Like most decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, Compound is a system of openly accessible smart contracts built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows borrowers (in green) to take out loans by depositing collateral. At the same time, it allows lenders (Compound refers to these users as “suppliers”) to earn interest on their loan. Both parties can trust the code to enforce the payment of interest by the borrowers by the lenders. So unlike traditional finance, in DeFi there is no KYC, no sign-up,and no middleman. cTokens Compound also allows lenders to actively trade their interest earned, without taking out their deposited liquidity. This means lenders can continue to earn interest while trading that interest in other protocols and earn more. Compound does this by tokenizing your deposit into cTokens. When a supplier (in blue) provides liquidity to Compound, in the form of USDC for example, they receive an equivalent amount of cUSDC. While the USDC has to stay locked in Compound, the cUSDC can be transacted and staked elsewhere. The exchange rate between the token deposited and the cToken will only get more favorable over time, as a way to incentivize liquidity providers to keep their funds in Compound longer. It starts at 0.020000 for all markets, meaning 1 cUSDC is worth 0.020000 USDC when you first deposit liquidity. After 100 days the exchange rate gets more favorable, at which point exchanging 1 cUSDC might get you 0.021591 USDC for example. Liquidators Liquidators are the users who seize assets from other users who have taken on more of a loan balance than Compound considers them entitled to. This is most often tied to the amount of collateral the user has supplied, which determines how much they can borrow. If a borrower ends up going over their limit, liquidators can seize a portion of their collateral for good. Compound constantly checks what the borrowers’ loan balances are. Compound accrues interest on loan balances which are expected to go up over time. The Comptroller The Comptroller creates and maintains markets on Compound. It is this contract that controls the supply of the cTokens available to each market. Governance COMP is Compound’s governance token, which means users who own it have a right to vote on governance proposals. COMP owners can also delegate their right to vote to any other wallet address. 42 proposals have been put forth so far. COMP can be bought on most crypto exchanges, and the foundation has also given some out for specific events. Fun Fact: 441 million USDC has been deposited in Compound so far. And the top three assets being deposited are ETH, DAI and USDC. API Access This article contains links to third-party websites or other content for information purposes only (“Third-Party Sites”).

    "detailedContent": "Who Is In, Who Is Out? Members of the Fundamental Asset Score (FCAS) 25 are reevaluated each month and must be ranked within the top 25 for at least 40 days to qualify. The FCAS is a comparative metric that evaluates the fundamental health of a crypto project, and the FCAS 25 is a weighted moving average of the top 25 projects that aims to show the overall health of the crypto industry. The notable newcomer to the March rankings is Balancer (BAL), which broke into the Top 25 to reach a rank of 14 as of Mar. 1. Ripple (XRP) dropped out of the Top 25 amid continuing uncertainty around the SEC lawsuit. Overall industry health can be assessed by taking the average FCAS of the 25 top projects. This overall industry health metric works as a good proxy for how the industry is doing as a whole. In the last month, the average FCAS score increased 5 points. Figure 1. Overall Industry Health February Witnesses Impressive DeFi Growth Though decentralized finance (DeFi) is by no means a new phenomenon, February witnessed impressive activity in the DeFi space. A number of DeFi protocols witnessed record monthly revenues, as did the overall DeFi space — to the tune of $171.5 million, according to research from The Block. Transaction volume continued unabated, as seen below in Figure 2. Figure 2. Ethereum Transactions by Transaction Type The dark blue bars reflect the rise in DeFi transactions since summer 2020 FCAS scores reflect the recent DeFi activity and are sensitive to accelerated developer activity in a number of major projects. While token price and liquidity garner the majority of headlines, active developer contributions are one of the strongest signals of healthy DeFi projects. Balancer is one clear example of that. Balancer-Aave Collaboration Pays Dividends for FCAS Score Balancer is an automated market maker (AMM) designed to facilitate the exchange of ERC-20 assets. It differentiates itself from other AMMs by means of a constant mean formula, designed to facilitate multiple assets and asset weightings other than 50-50 pairings. Balancer made crypto news recently when its CEO, Fernando Martinelli, announced a collaboration with Aave, known as the Balancer V2 Asset Manager. This partnership will enable assets in Balancer pools to earn yield in Aave. Enabling this type of partnership requires a lot of developer work. We see this reflected in Balancer’s code contributions over the past month, visible in the bottom right of Figure 3: Figure 3. Code Contributions at Balancer After a lull in December and early January (coders taking time off for the holidays, perhaps?), Balancer’s codebase saw a spate of activity. While it’s impossible to know for sure, it is reasonable to assume that this activity was related to the AAVE collaboration and the dev work necessary to make it go. As evidence, take a look at the recent rise in Aave’s developer score and overall FCAS score. Both scores go up significantly, which supports the hypothesis that Aave was working on something big during the same time period as Balancer. Figure 4. Aave - FCAS Score and Developer Score Over the past month, Balancer scores highly on user activity and does well in terms of market maturity, but neither metric changed substantially in February. However, Balancer’s developer activity rose significantly enough to propel the project’s overall FCAS score into the top 25. Figure 5. Balancer - User Activity Score and Market Maturity Score Figure 5. Balancer’s Overall FCAS Score Since the start of the year, Balancer’s project health as measured by FCAS has been on a steady climb, due primarily to the activity of its developer community Aave: Coming Soon? As we have seen, Aave’s developer community was just as active in February as Balancer’s. Barring a severe reversal, we expect this increased activity to result in Aave’s appearance on the FCAS 25 list next month. The FCAS methodology rewards consistency: demonstrating project health via high performance in successive months is necessary to earn inclusion in the FCAS 25. In other words, the very best crypto projects don’t just reach the top of the mountain — they tend to stay there.

    "title": "What\u0027s New on CoinMarketCap?",
    "detailedContent": "CoinMarketCap\u0027s 2021 Q1 Recap 2021 was off to an inauspicious start, with a relatively confused atmosphere and the uncertainties of the pandemic and a continuous lockdown in many parts of the world. However, 2021 also welcomed some positive events. In the crypto world, we witnessed the ATHs for Bitcoin, Ethereum and many more coins, and we also witnessed the surprising high auction price for a NFT art piece by Beeple! With this crypto fever continuing, the CoinMarketCap team was keeping busy and tried very hard to deliver features that you’ve long asked for! It’s always good to look back on what we have achieved, and hopefully you are now enjoying all the new things we’ve provided to you! Enhancements on CoinMarketCap\u0027s Website In Q1 2021, we delivered a few important products, including: 1. Enhanced watchlist Our watchlist feature has always been a long loved product. We didn’t think merging the portfolio feature with watchlist would be a good idea; instead, we put in more thoughts into how to make it a more powerful tool for everyone. We expanded the functionality of the CoinMarketCap watchlist in the following ways: Enabled multiple watchlists for every user; Added the public watchlist feature for users to share their own investment ideas; Added the ability to follow others’ watchlists and get some ideas of coins/ tokens to watch for; Added a leaderboard of public watchlist and ranked the most popular watchlists. 2. Customized homepage We know that you have been asking us to add lots of different data items, but our homepage is not big enough to accommodate everyone’s requests. Therefore, we thought of a solution, which was to provide more data items and let you decide how your homepage should look! With our auto-refreshed data and your own customized homepage, we believe you can make the best choice for your next investment. 3. New filtering With more and more projects listed on CoinMarketCap, and more and more different types of projects, it’s hard to keep up with all the new coins or tokens added in the specific type of cryptocurrencies you care about. We made a good cleanup with all the projects’ tags and added the new filtering criteria. Now you can filter by category (e.g. Collectibles \u0026 NFT, DeFi, etc), algorithm (e.g. PoS, PoW, PoC or more), platform (e.g. Ethereum, BSC, Polkadot and more) or industry (like gambling, memes, etc). Plus all the good criteria we used to provide (such as filtering by price change, volume, etc), you can get a nice and really targeted list of coins/tokens. 4. Category ranking and category pages You might want to watch from the coin/token level, but have you thought about monitoring performances of a specific crypto category? We provide you with a new category ranking page that you can see the aggregated performance of different crypto sectors. You can also view what coins belong to that category very easily by clicking the category name, or simply click on the different tags on the coin page. 5. ICO Calendar Still have a lack of investment ideas? There are some new projects which might attract your attention and if you want to get to the front seat, you’ll definitely need to get in quickly! We provided an overview of ICO events on the new ICO calendar page, easier to find good new projects to invest in or to understand what’s going on in the crypto world. We’ve also listed these ICO tokens before they are released, so you can put them in your watchlist from an earlier stage. Other enhancements on the coin detail page include the following: Integrated with TradingView chart; Added Wallets tab; Added total value locked (TVL), Market Cap/TVL Ratio, and Volume/Market Cap ratio; Added MetaMask link; Added Dextool link. Enhancements of the CoinMarketCap Mobile App The CoinMarketCap website isn’t the only thing that saw lots of progress in Q1 — the CoinMarketCap mobile app has become even more useful for checking the prices of crypto and more, right from your pocket. 1. Enhanced watchlist We brought our enhanced watchlist feature from the website to our mobile app as well. Mobile app users can sync their watchlist between devices and take it with them on the go! You get all of the same new features like multiple watchlists, shareable watchlists and the ability to follow popular lists all on your mobile device. 2. Portfolio enhancements Based on feedback from our community, we made the following adjustments to our portfolio: Price auto refresh on the portfolio page, so you always have the latest prices. We brought back the option to view your portfolio balance in your default fiat currency and default cryptocurrency. Simply tap your portfolio balance to toggle back and forth. 3. To further our mission of showcasing the crypto revolution to the world, we translated our Android app into eight new languages! German Indonesian Japanese Korean Spanish Thai Turkish Vietnamese Android users can now select their preferred language from the language menu on the settings page. Other updates View token contract address on coin details page and link to meta mask on the coin details pages To keep up with the latest trends, we added new sections on the Sectors tab for Polkadot Ecosystem, Binance Smart Chain Ecosystem and NFTs \u0026 Collectibles. Use these pages to track the trending tokens in each sector and the largest sectors by market cap. We hope to see you soon, checking out all our new features, on CoinMarketCap!",

    "title": "8 Key Women in Crypto — In Honor of International Women’s Day",
    "detailedContent": "Recent research from eToro suggests only 15% of Bitcoin traders are women — powerfully illustrating the gender imbalance that exists in the world of cryptocurrencies. Nonetheless, there are reasons to be optimistic. A report from Gemini indicates that, among those who are planning to invest in crypto, 40% are female. Better still, a greater number of women are making an impact in high-profile positions throughout the digital assets sector — and this representation will be crucial for enacting change at every level of the industry. March 8 is International Women’s Day — and this year’s theme is Choose to Challenge. To celebrate, let’s shine a spotlight on eight women with a prominent voice in crypto. This isn’t a countdown, nor an exhaustive list, but it’s an impressive collection of professionals. 1. Hester Peirce, SEC commissioner Affectionately known as “Crypto Mom” by many in the sector, Hester Peirce is an SEC commissioner who is playing an instrumental role in delivering a regulatory framework for digital assets. Working alongside the new chairman Gary Gensler, Peirce began her second five-year term in the role last August — meaning she’ll be in her post until 2025. Peirce has won plaudits by being passionate about delivering clarity for the crypto industry — something that she believes is crucial for fostering innovation in the space. She strikes a refreshing tone in speeches about the digital economy, too. Speaking last month at George Washington University Law School, she said: “We tend to look at technological innovation in the markets with deep suspicion, and that mindset has to change.” She was also full of praise for the DeFi sector, adding: “Although a work in progress with all the growing pains and rough edges that implies, DeFi’s promises of democratization, open access, transparency, predictability, and systemic resilience are alluring.” 2. Ria Bhutoria, Fidelity Digital Assets research director As a research director at Fidelity Digital Assets, Ria Bhutoria is delivering razor-sharp analysis of what’s happening in the crypto markets and why — all while helping to address some of the persistent criticisms surrounding Bitcoin. One of her coolest innovations has been the “FUD Fort” — a carefully cultivated list of articles that helps to address some of the biggest areas of fear, uncertainty and doubt that proliferate in the crypto space…surrounding the environment, manipulation, limited throughput, illicit activity, volatility and everything in between. Bhutoria also shares pearls of wisdom on her Twitter page, writing last month: “I have never regretted buying more Bitcoin and I have always regretted not buying more Bitcoin.” If you’re looking for a way to make sense of what’s going on, her posts serve as essential reading. 3. Camila Russo, The Defiant founder For outsiders, some areas of the crypto sector — especially decentralized finance — can be exceedingly confusing to follow. Camila Russo is one journalist who has been making remarkable in-roads in demystifying this space for all of us. Formerly a reporter at Bloomberg, she went on to write an in-depth book that told the story of Ethereum. She’s now launched The Defiant — a media outlet that tracks DeFi’s story through a website, a newsletter, YouTube videos and a podcast. We’ve even been lucky enough to welcome Camila to CoinMarketCap Academy, where she wrote this brilliant deep dive into DeFi — chronicling its evolution from a Telegram chat between developers and entrepreneurs to a bustling sector that now has a total value locked of about $40 billion. 4. Elizabeth Stark, Lightning Labs CEO and co-founder Bitcoin can only handle about five transactions a second, but Elizabeth Stark is spearheading an effort to make BTC payments far faster and cheaper than they are now. She’s the CEO of Lightning Labs, the company behind a layer 2 solution for Bitcoin that ultimately aims to serve as a Visa-inspired network for the cryptocurrency. Although the technology is still being finessed, it could prove essential in ensuring that Bitcoin can be used widely as a payment method — and all without the blockchain suffering the same levels of congestion that Ethereum does. 5. Caitlin Long, Avanti Financial Group founder and CEO After an illustrious career at Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, Caitlin Long has now set her sights on the world of blockchain. This year, she’s set to launch a new bank called Avanti, which aims to serve institutional customers and high net worth individuals. Her financial institution is based in Wyoming, and she serves on the state’s Blockchain Select Committee. Long says that Avanti aims to offer a “critical” piece of infrastructure that’s currently missing from the market — a regulated bank that can provide crypto custody services. She argues that pension funds, corporations and other entities need this to exist before they can gain exposure to Bitcoin in any meaningful way. 6. Kristin Smith, Blockchain Association executive director Kristin Smith runs the Blockchain Association — and is focused on helping the crypto industry to develop “a strategic roadmap for public policy.” It’s a role she’s exceedingly qualified for after working in House and Senate offices at a senior level, as well as private sector experience in advocating for telecoms companies. The association’s goal is to help tackle some of the regulatory hurdles that stop entrepreneurs from innovating — and support lawmakers who have to take security concerns and consumer protection into account. 7. Sheila Warren, World Economic Forum head of blockchain and data policy With attitudes towards crypto and blockchain shifting, and the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos crucial for shaping opinion, Sheila Warren’s role as head of blockchain and data policy at the WEF is a significant one. She recently set out a series of predictions for 2021 — writing: “It is likely that financial institutions and service providers will intensify their own experiments with, and use of, cryptocurrency this year, whether via investment or actual deployment.” Warren also believes that there will be great strides in unlocking the potential of non-fungible tokens, and plenty of exploration surrounding the merits of decentralization. 8. Christine Lagarde, European Central Bank president Although Christine Lagarde isn’t working specifically in the crypto sector, she has a tremendous amount of influence in its future — especially when it comes to Bitcoin regulation, and whether Europe will push ahead with plans to launch its own central bank digital currency. It’s fair to say the seasoned central banker isn’t a fan of BTC — and last month, she didn’t mince her words in proclaiming that the ECB won’t be holding the cryptocurrency in reserve, describing such a development as “out of the question.” However, in September 2019, Lagarde had said that central banks and regulators should recognize the social benefits of technological innovations like digital currencies and allow the space to develop.",

    "title": "TI Weekly Research: Wandering and Waiting",
    "detailedContent": "‍The steady volatility did not bring about the price increase as expected. Affected by the uncertainty of macro factors, both institutions and individuals were waiting-and-seeing. In the spot market, Ethereum\u0027s trading volume fell sharply by $25.33 billion, close to half of last week. Bitcoin\u0027s trading volume also declined. A similar situation appeared in the derivatives market, whether it was futures or options, the trading volume came to a low ebb period. From some indicators, professional investors still maintain a positive attitude towards Ethereum and its DeFi ecosystem in the short term, betting on the performance of Ethereum after the upgrade in the middle of the year. For Bitcoin, professional investors tend to believe it to be bearish considering the macro factors. Low Volatility: Mainstream Cryptocurrencies Lack Momentum for Upward Breakthroughs Bitcoin price changes in the past 30 days, as of 4: 00 on June 18, source: tokeninsight.com One month has passed since the Black Swan incident that occurred on May 19th. Although volatility has fallen to \"near-normal\" levels, the price of Bitcoin remains below $40,000 most of the time. Since last month, supervision, interest rate hike expectations, and table shrinkage expectations have followed one after another, which is the reason for the continued wait-and-see of the market. Although a small amount of good news was released in the short term, its stimulating effect on the market tends to last for a short time. Year-to-date changes in Bitcoin index price and perpetual contract price volatility, source: gvol.io As the expectation of interest rate hikes has gradually become clear, from the perspective of skewness, the sentiment of bearish Bitcoin has always continued: regardless of the short-term, medium-term, and long-term, the skewness is still negative, which indicates that the bearish sentiment for Bitcoin is still continued to be included in options pricing. Changes in Bitcoin options skewness in the past year, source: gvol.io At the same time, in the futures market, the high premium of Bitcoin futures no longer exists. From the pricing of Bitcoin futures on OKEx, it can be found that the premium of forward futures generally does not exceed 10%, while the price of futures due in the near future is even slightly lower. The current price indicates that bearish sentiment in the Bitcoin market is spreading, and a certain consensus has been reached in the derivatives market. Bitcoin futures prices on OKEx, as of 3:00 on June 18th, source: okex.com In terms of trading volume, both Bitcoin spot and perpetual contract trading volumes have declined compared to last week, but they are much better than Ethereum, which has a heavier wait-and-see sentiment. In the exchanges tracked by Tokeninsight this week, Bitcoin spot trading volume was approximately $65.91 billion, while perpetual contract volume was $458.8 billion. In contrast, the weekly spot volume of Ethereum fell to $37.47 billion, while the weekly volume of perpetual contracts fell to $145.8 billion. Speculators seem to be concentrating their chips on Bitcoin to bet on recent macroeconomic trends to profit. For Ethereum, the signals from the derivatives market are different. Investors in the options market have higher expectations for Ethereum taking into account the relatively solid fundamentals of Ethereum. This makes the implied volatility be higher than the historical volatility of Ethereum, and the volatility skewness continues to be negative this week -- based on past experience, this is usually a signal that \"asset prices are undervalued\". Professional investors still maintain a positive attitude towards Ethereum and its DeFi ecosystem in the short term. The historical volatility and implied volatility of Ethereum in the past 30 days, source: gvol.io As for the whole market, the impact of macro factors is greater than the impact of fundamentals: Although asset prices continue to be undervalued, investors are still waiting-and-seeing. Under the background of the low ebb brought by macro factors, many investors hope to obtain the opportunity to acquire high-quality assets at a low price, while the seller will not choose to sell it at a low price. The game and see-saw between the two sides has led to the new low on trading volume of Ethereum in nearly a month. Ethereum trading volume changes in the past 30 days, as of 3:00 on June 18, source: tokeninsight.com Similarly, due to the influence of macro factors transmitted to Ethereum and then transmitted to the DeFi market for a second time, this week, the market value of several major project tokens, such as UNI, SOL, KSM, etc., has shrunk to a certain extent. Among them, the market value of Polkadot\u0027s Kusama testnet has shrunk by 26.3% this week and is now $2.85 billion, while other projects have fallen by less than 20%. However, most mainstream projects are in a slow downward trend, and the wait-and-see sentiment has caused certain adverse effects on the DeFi market. KSM token price changes in the past 7 days, source: tokeninsight.com From the perspective of the futures market, the pricing of Ethereum futures by futures investors is more affected by macro factors. The price of forward futures due for delivery at the end of the year has been lower than $2,400, which has not generated enough premium due to fundamentals. Bitcoin futures prices on OKEx as of 3:30 on June 18th, source: okex.com Focus on the \"Great Delivery Day\" June 25 is the mid-year \"Great Delivery Day\" of the derivatives market. Options and futures of the current quarter, second quarter, current month, and next month will be concentrated on this day for centralized settlement and delivery, which often brings large spot price fluctuations, or may also increase volatility. In a bull market, the impact of delivery on the market is not obvious. However, in a downward market, derivatives delivery often triggers a price drop on the Thursday before delivery, and the price slowly recovers after the delivery is completed. The scale of delivery on June 25 can be said to be the largest so far: Ethereum options contract alone will have more than 580,000 expire on this day, and Bitcoin will also have more than 65,000 options contracts expire on this day. At the same time, the allocation of derivatives positions for the third quarter and the second half of the year will also occur around that date. The above events may cause major fluctuations in the prices of mainstream crypto assets. Ethereum options contracts open interest, source: gvol.io Bitcoin options contract open interest, source: gvol.io The underestimation of the price of Ethereum may continue until around the delivery date. The reason is that the low valuation period is usually a good time for derivatives allocation, which can control risks at a lower cost and obtain more benefits. For Bitcoin, there are currently no positive signals, so its price may follow the current range (between $35,000-$40,000) until around the delivery date. However, due to the increased uncertainty in the macro market, the \"Great Delivery Day\" of derivatives will also bring higher uncertainty, and investors are gradually becoming conservative: currently in the options market, more than half of investors have adopted the \"sell strategy\" to counter the price declines.

    "detailedContent": "Affected by the macro market turbulence, the volatility of mainstream cryptos has risen, but they are still in the low volatility range. The rebound in market risk appetite has pushed up the prices of commodities and crypto assets, but whether the market will pick up still needs to wait for the end of July to determine. Market Confidence Recovered With More Potential Volatility Earlier this week, due to the panic caused by the rebound of the epidemic, the stock market and bulk commodities all fell sharply, affecting the crypto market. News related to the regulation of stablecoins further lowered the market\u0027s expectations for the crypto market. On Tuesday, the price of BTC fell below $30,000 for the first time, and the market was bearish. The put/call ratio of ETH options once reached 1.7. But beginning on Wednesday, the B Word online summit strongly supported the market bulls, and the crypto market institutions rebounded. The prices of cryptos has recovered and the volatility has begun to rise. As of Friday, the historical volatility of Bitcoin has rebounded to the 60 moving average, while the historical volatility of Ethereum has rebounded to above the 80 moving average, which is conducive to the operation of volatility-related strategies. Market confidence has also recovered. The recent skewness of the mainstream cryptos has risen significantly, indicating that optimism has begun to be included in the pricing. The negative basis rate of the next week and the front-month futures has been wiped out, and the recent bitcoin futures even have a small positive premium. However, since a series of economic indicators and data will be announced at the end of the month, and next week will be the monthly settlement period for derivatives, market volatility may further increase, and it is necessary to pay attention to the risk of price fluctuations in the short term. Changes in the volatility of Bitcoin and Ethereum in the past 30 days, Source: gvol.io Macroeconomic Factors Dominate the Crypto Market Temporarily This week, the impact of macroeconomic factors on the market is higher than that of supervision, but the long-term layout and plan of the supervisory agency still cannot be ignored. Annual basis premium of main crypto futures in Deribit, Source: gvol.io U.S. government agencies and regulators have begun to develop a regulatory framework for stablecoins and DeFi, and are trying to push individual investors away from the crypto asset trading market. On July 19, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued a serious warning against crypto assets such as Bitcoin and told individuals not to participate in it. The FBI stated that cybercriminals targeted cryptocurrency users, exchanges and third-party payment platforms in the crypto industry, causing massive economic losses to victims. On July 20th, US Treasury Secretary Yellen convened US regulators to discuss stablecoin rules. At the meeting, participants discussed the rapid growth of stablecoins, the potential use of stablecoins as a means of payment, and potential risks to end users, financial systems, and national security. The U.S. Financial Markets Working Group also listened to an introduction from the Department of the Treasury on the preparation of the stablecoin report. The report discussed the potential benefits and risks of stablecoins, the current regulatory framework in the United States, and suggestions for resolving regulatory gaps. The working group is expected to issue recommendations in the coming months. On July 21, SEC Chairman Gensler stated that even on a decentralized platform, cryptocurrencies priced in securities must comply with securities regulations. European regulators have proposed a ban on anonymous cryptocurrency transactions, but the short-term impact is not significant. As part of the plan to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, the European Union proposes to ban anonymous cryptocurrency transactions. The plan announced on July 20 includes a number of proposals to strengthen financial transaction supervision, including the creation of a new EU institution with about 250 people to supervise high-risk financial institutions, and a ban on cash transactions exceeding 10,000 euros. The European Union said it would ban anonymous crypto asset wallets. The European Commission stated that it should impose the same regulations on cryptocurrencies as regular bank wire transfers. The plan must be approved by the European Parliament and the European Council, and the process may be lengthy. The EU stated that the goal is to start operating a new anti-money laundering agency in 2024. Although the crypto market suffered a series of blows in Q2, since the Q3, market confidence has shown signs of recovery. CNBC reported that despite the setbacks of cryptocurrencies, blockchain companies received a total of $4.4B in financing in the second quarter. Global X Bitcoin Trust stated that in order to achieve its investment goals, the trust will hold Bitcoin. This week, the cryptocurrency exchange FTX announced a financing of $900M, one of the largest financings this quarter, and its valuation has reached $18B. Although the crypto market is showing signs of recovery, as the Fed’s interest rate resolution and other important economic information will be announced next week, the volatility of the macro market will increase significantly. The volatility at the beginning of this week proves the increasingly close correlation between the crypto market and the macro economy, which requires continuous attention to the macro market situation. Trading in response to macro expectations will dominate the crypto market this week and next week. It is expected that the volatility of the crypto market will increase with macro fluctuations, but the increase is limited and will remain at a low-to-medium level in the short term.

    "title": "Bitcoin Bounces Around $50,000 With Mixed Signals: A Data Perspective by IntoTheBlock",
    "detailedContent": "Every week, IntoTheBlock brings you on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. This week, we dive into Bitcoin’s rebound towards the $50,000 price tag despite metrics pointing to new buyers slowing down. We also take a look at the price levels to watch out for based on blockchain buying activity. Bitcoin Remains Within Key Price Range with Mixed Signals Following a 25% correction from $58,000 to $43,000, Bitcoin has bounced back towards $50,000. The recent rebound has come along with news and speculation as per usual. In regards to news, Reuters recently reported that Goldman Sachs is planning to reopen its cryptocurrency desk, after shutting it down in 2018. The trading desk is expected to launch at some point this month, giving yet another stamp of approval from Wall Street to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Similarly, a well-known Bitcoin skeptic has appeared to also have changed his mind on Bitcoin. Kevin O’Leary, best known for his role as a Shark Tank investor, decided to allocate 3% of his portfolio into Bitcoin just a couple of months after calling it a “giant nothing-burger.” Additionally, speculation on Twitter adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet was sparked by its recent $1.25 billion convertible note. Though there is no mention of crypto in the official announcement, the crypto community took it as a potential sign of the social media giant looking to invest in Bitcoin following MicroStrategy’s similar move and Jack Dorsey’s investment and support through Square. Speculation aside, Bitcoin’s on-chain data provide valuable insights into its current situation. The number of addresses being created, new addresses, are indicative of the level of interest from new entrants. This indicator just hit a six-month low for Bitcoin following its retracement. As of Mar. 2, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin network indicators A similar image is reflected in the Google searches for Bitcoin: after reaching yearly highs in early January, the number of searches for the term Bitcoin have slowed down despite its price continuing to climb. As of Mar. 2, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin social indicators While new interest may be slowing down, it does not necessarily mean that the buying activity has stopped altogether as existing players may continue to accumulate. This trend also contrasts the recent report about Goldman Sachs reopening its crypto trading desk, which creates mixed signals that may leave investors uncertain about what Bitcoin’s next step is. By looking into the positioning of investors that bought near the current price, we obtain a better understanding of near-term forces at play. IntoTheBlock’s In/Out of the Money Around Price (IOMAP) analyzes the profitability of addresses that previously bought within 15% of the current price and is useful to understand levels of support and resistance based on blockchain data. In short, the IOMAP labels clusters of addresses as in the money if their average investment price is below the current price, meaning that they are profiting on paper from their investment. As of Mar. 2, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin financial indicators Currently, the IOMAP indicates a large cluster of addresses (970K) and volume (403K BTC) had been bought slightly below $50,000. This price range, which already saw high levels of trading activity, is expected to act as strong resistance short-term as investors in this price range may look to break-even on their positions at this point. On the other hand, the IOMAP points to strong support between $45,400 to $46,800, where previously 956K addresses bought a total of 598K BTC. The high amount of trading activity at this range points to the likelihood of investors looking to buy back near this range and create support before price lowers further. Ultimately, a break past $45,000 may mean Bitcoin will retrace further, while a breakout past $50,000 may suggest it is poised for new highs. These are the levels to watch out for before being certain of the correction being over or not.

    "title": "Hedge, FOMO and Chance: Weekly Market Review by TokenInsight",
    "detailedContent": "A large fluctuation came this week. Under short-term operations, Bitcoin fell from a high of $58,000 to about $45,000, detonating panic in the market, and other cryptos such as exchange tokens and mainstream tokens plummeted at the same time, and the average decline this week was over 10%. However, in the panic, new blue-chip tokens began to be discovered: Solana series tokens, old brand public chain Cardano, DAG public chain Fantom, etc. have become rookies who have bucked the trend in this round of volatility. Behind every market turmoil, there are new investment opportunities hidden. Hedging and Big Shocks: Mainstream Cryptos Plummet The downtrend started by shorts this week has been going on for nearly a week. After rising to the peak of US$58,000, so far, Bitcoin has fallen to near the US$46,000 line, giving up all the gains since the Chinese New Year. Bitcoin price \u0026 volume in the last 30 days, chart from 1:00am EST, Feb. 26. Source: tokeninsight.com The sharp drop of Bitcoin triggered panic across the market, and speculation was quietly spreading. On the one hand, companies such as Microstrategy took advantage of the low prices to start large-scale acquisitions of various cryptos, and the Whalesmap showed that the Bitcoin whales sold 140,000 Bitcoin during this fluctuation, which worth over $7B. On the other hand, the lack of market confidence caused by Bitcoin\u0027s sharp call back has caused other cryptos to suffer severe setbacks at the same time. As of 1:00 am on Feb. 26, the price of ETH had fallen by 23.11% this week, BNB had fallen by 10.8%, and non-mainstream cryptos’ prices such as Litecoin and BCH have fallen by more than a quarter. Panic has also triggered a massive wave of selling, or general “FOMO.” The weekly Bitcoin spot trading volume reached $112.56B, an increase of 56.36% compared to last week, and the daily trading volume on Tuesday and Wednesday exceeded $25B, reaching the highest trading level during the market turmoil in January. A similar situation has occurred in mainstream cryptos such as Ethereum. Bitcoin spot trading volume in the last 90 days, chart from 1:00am EST, Feb. 26. Source: tokeninsight.com How long will this round of fluctuation last? It\u0027s hard to judge. It is certain that we still seem to be in a bull market, for the price of cryptos is still at its peak, and various projects are constantly emerging, obtaining financing and issuing tokens. From the perspective of the options market, the market still maintains a relatively optimistic attitude towards Bitcoin: investors generally believe that Bitcoin will return to around $50,000 in the near future, but for the medium and long term, from the perspective of skew, the market attitude tends to be stable and optimistic, and this is incorporated into the pricing of options. The recent skew distribution of the Bitcoin options. Source: gvol.io However, investors don’t have much bullish sentiment for Ethereum. Affected by the public chains of exchanges such as BSC and Heco and competitors of public chains such as Solana and Polkadot, the problems of Ethereum\u0027s higher gas fees and lower transaction speed have gradually been exposed. Although Ethereum 2.0 is still being deployed in an orderly manner, in the background of the bull market, investors still have a certain degree of skepticism about Ethereum’s future and the benefits that it can bring. These sentiments are also reflected in the skew: the short-term and medium-term skew of Ethereum options shows that the bearish attitude towards Ethereum currently has the upper hand.

Source: gvol.io ‘The Surfing Club’: New Blue Chip Tokens Rise Against the Trend In the sorrows of the market, there are still a few tokens that have withstood the pressure and maintained their upward momentum. Among the exchanges tokens, the market value of OKB and KCS has increased by more than 35% this week, Uniswap rose by 8.5%, and its circulating market value (based on the UNI in circulation) reached $6.736B, which is the best performance in the DeFi exchanges. UNI, OKB and KCS price in the last 7 days, chart from 2:00am EST, Feb. 26. Source: tokeninsight.com The best performing blue chip tokens this week came from non-Ethereum public chains, including Solana, Fantom and Cardano. As an old brand public chain, Cardano has remained stable during this fluctuation. The market value of its token ADA rose by 10.75% to $31.243B. The highlights of this week are Solana and Fantom. The price of Solana’s token SOL rose to 46.96%, reaching $13.55, with a market value of $3.54B. Fantom’s token FTM performed best, with an increase of over 167%, and the current market value has entered The top 50 in the crypto market was $1.38B. SOL and FTM price in the last 7 days, chart from 2:00am EST, Feb 26. Source: tokeninsight.com It is worth noting that the two public chains are inextricably linked with FTX and Alamanda Research. As a major investment project of Alamanda Research, the Solana public chain with its on-chain applications and Fantom are all important roles of FTX in the layout of the DeFi market as planned. This week, Solana and the issued tokens of representative applications on the chain have achieved varying degrees of rise. Taking the decentralized exchanges Serum as an example, its exchange-token SRM has risen by 47.62% this week. As an important competitor of Ethereum, Solana performed very strongly in the first quarter of 2021. Considering the issues of gas fees and transaction efficiency, Ethereum is no longer considered the only option for investors and developers. With the gradual maturity of the non-Ethereum public chain, a large number of decentralized applications began to launch on the non-Ethereum public chain and began to gradually break the original market structure. Following Polkadot, dozens of new projects and new public chains will emerge in 2021. In the context of market turmoil, investment in non-mainstream public chains and their projects on the chain is a new profitable direction.

    "detailedContent": "Every week IntoTheBlock brings you on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. This week, we focus on the crypto-assets leading in 2021 so far and potential reasons for their outstanding performance. With Ether reaching new all-time highs, we dive into factors pushing Ethereum and other smart contract platforms higher, as well as decentralized finance (DeFi) applications built on top of them. “Alt Season” Being Led by Smart Contract Platforms \u0026 DeFi The so-called Alt Season has arrived, as cryptoassets with smaller market capitalization than Bitcoin are outperforming the market. Despite the fact that only three weeks have passed in 2021, many cryptoassets have already seen triple-digit growth. By analyzing the top performers year-to-date, we observe that the majority of the gains are being realized by smart contract platforms and DeFi applications: The table above displays the top 10 highest returning cryptoassets so far in 2021. The dominance of smart contract platforms and DeFi is evident, with Stellar being the only exception (though they do support limited smart contract functionality). As of Jan. 19, 2020 through IntoTheBlock’s DeFi Insights DeFi tokens in particular have enjoyed remarkable growth over the last month, with their aggregate market cap doubling from $10 billion to $20 billion. These protocols have been favored by a market currently centered around opportunities with high potential. There are two likely reasons for smart contract platforms’ and DeFi’s leading returns: the market’s risk-on stance and the increasing demand for censorship resistance. Risk-On Market Realizes the Value of Censorship Resistance The risk-on positioning from the market can be observed from the high returns of volatile assets such as crypto. This positioning is linked to the upcoming $1.9 trillion stimulus package in the United States, which has increased forecasts for economic growth in the largest economy. Due to this and the federal reserves’ plans to keep interest rates at zero for the foreseeable future, stocks and risky assets have rallied. In particular, assets with high potential growth such as space exploration (e.g. Virgin Galactic), electric vehicles (Tesla), next-generation finance (DeFi) and decentralized infrastructure. Decentralization has also gained momentum amidst unprecedented censorship. Following the incitement of violence from former U.S. president Donald Trump, social media platforms permanently banned him. Similarly, social network Parler was kicked off Amazon Web Services following the incident. As a result, Google search results for “censorship” worldwide reached a five-year high. As of Jan. 19, 2020 (6PM EST) via Google Trends In light of the attention surrounding censorship, blockchain technology has been brought up by many as a potential solution. In short, public blockchain allows censorship-resistance as it is not controlled by one single entity or group of entities, but rather by a decentralized network. As the crypto venture fund Paradigm’s cofounder Matt Huang implies, the increased censorship highlights the value proposition of a decentralized web built on top of smart contract platforms. Overall, crypto holders by and large profited from their assets thus far in 2021. As speculation in crypto increases, we see risk-on positioning accompanied by a growing proposition for decentralization as drivers in the recent run-up. Smart contract platforms and decentralized finance protocols have accrued the most value as they fit both of these narratives. Ultimately, the next few years should be pivotal for crypto protocols to realize their potential as censorship-resistant next generation applications, instead of merely a risky bet.

    "title": "Coinbase IPO Propels a Risk-On Market: A Data Perspective by IntoTheBlock",
    "detailedContent": "Every week, IntoTheBlock brings you on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. This week we dive into the anticipated Coinbase IPO and how it is likely to affect markets. We also analyze the performance and correlations of other crypto stocks, and the implications it may have on risk sentiment for crypto markets. Coinbase IPO Propels a Risk-On Market Crypto markets have been roaring towards the $2 trillion total market cap. Despite the recent correction experienced in the past 48 hours, risk-on sentiment remains at least for now. Risk-taking activity can easily be observed from the rotation in assets out of Bitcoin and into altcoins, particularly tokens with lower market capitalization. As of Apr. 7 through CoinMarketCap’s global charts As can be seen in the graph above, Bitcoin’s dominance is 56.3% — its lowest since June 2019. Conversely, the market share of cryptoassets outside of the top 10 is at its highest since August 2020 towards the end of the so-called DeFi summer. The risk-on sentiment may be linked to the upcoming Coinbase IPO. Coinbase will be entering the Nasdaq through a direct listing with the ticker COIN on Apr. 14. Coinbase also recently disclosed its Q1 earnings, where it netted $1.8 billion in revenue, surpassing the total revenue they received in all of 2020. The exchange also reported 6.1 million monthly transacting users. The anticipated IPO will act as a major stamp of approval for crypto markets. Coinbase will instantly become the largest crypto company publicly traded in stock markets. It’s legitimizing effect has been touted by many as a point of inflection in broader acceptance of crypto. However, Coinbase most certainly is not the first crypto company to go public. As a matter of fact, shares in crypto companies such as Marathon Patent Group and Silvergate have been outperforming the market. As of Apr. 7, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Capital Markets Insights While these companies have resulted in a higher return on investment in the past three months, MicroStrategy has underperformed regardless of their continuous Bitcoin investments. Crypto-related companies such as these have unsurprisingly moved in tandem with Bitcoin’s and Ether’s price. As of Apr. 7, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Capital Markets Insights The high correlation between these companies’ stocks and crypto means that there is a positive statistical relationship between the two. Even for companies with consolidated revenue streams outside of crypto, such as Nvidia and PayPal, the correlation is highly strong at 0.62 and 0.54 with Bitcoin, respectively. This trend could suggest that both Bitcoin and large tech companies are being treated as a risk-on play amid the continuing growth of stimulus in the United States. As opportunities for growth in traditional industries decreases, it is likely that more and more investors look into crypto and tech broadly for higher risk opportunities. The Coinbase IPO comes in a pivotal moment: as Bitcoin’s price has failed to sustain above $60K, a catalyst like this could lead to new entrants coming into the market. While there is a significant amount of speculation surrounding this event and the final impact is yet to be seen, it will most certainly mark a milestone for crypto’s history.

    "detailedContent": "The theme of this week is “Silence.” After about two months’ prosperity from October, the crypto market steps into inactivity. It seems like investors have finally calmed down to some extent and breaking news hasn’t seemed to bump up volumes this week. What is also worth mentioning is that Singapore is currently conducting lots of actions to accelerate the layout of its blockchain ecosystem, especially in the field of financial services. No one questions Singapore\u0027s vital position in the global financial ecosystem, therefore, the market is still slowly growing beneath the surface. Let’s look forward to the performance of the crypto market next year. Trading Volume Shrinks, But the Future Is Still Expectable Unlike the hot stock market, the crypto market is quiet in December this year. Compared with last week, the trading volumes of main cryptos shrank more than a quarter in both the spot market and contracts market, taking it back to the same levels seen in October. Although Bitcoin’s price dropped from $19,500 to lower than $18,000 during this period, there is no significant increment of trading from the probable panic.

Source: tokeninsight.com Market Sentiment Implied in Three Indicators Some analysts believe that this silent atmosphere very likely happens near the end of each year. Lots of investors and traders clear their inventory for vacation and are waiting to re-enter the market after Christmas and the new year. Perhaps this is true, but not always the case. We can find some clues from the crypto options and futures market. The funding rate is a useful indicator and is able to reflect the change of confidence in the market. From the perspective of BTC, the perpetual contracts’ funding rate turned negative, which means that more traders are holding short positions, and they don’t have that much confidence in the short-term market. Funding rates of BTC in the last 30 (Up) / 90 (Down) days, chart from 9pm EST, Dec. 10. Source: tokeninsight.com Similarly, ETH contract volatility of funding rates has decreased and been concentrated near the 0% line, which means that the scales of investors with long positions and short positions are roughly the same, and all of them are still holding their assets to see the trends of the market. Another clue is open interest. Unlike trading volumes, open interests in futures and contracts are still maintained at a high level. Compared to the booming of November, there is no trend about volatility at the present. This illustrates that investors are not trading frequently or clearing their inventories for Christmas. They are just watching the fluctuation and waiting for a good chance. Furthermore, implied volatility also hides some information. Generally speaking, implied volatility reflects unequivocal future anticipations of market performance, and investors will sell options with higher volatility and buy options with lower volatility, so analysts are able to know what traders are thinking about by this indicator. From the perspective of the recent volatility surface, we can find that investors tend to sell options. According to the concept mentioned above, we speculate that investors lack confidence for the short term of the market. Recent implied volatility surface of BTC options, chart from 11:00am EST, Dec. 10, Source: gvol.io However, investors are still keeping enough confidence in the long-term future. On one hand, the forward volatility surface illustrates that investors are tending to buy options, which implies positive predictions from the aggregated market. On the other hand, from the perspective of the term structure of implied volatility, the market is in a state of contango, indicating that the possible peak of trading will come next year.

Recently, Singapore has issued the Payment Services Act, PSA. However, according to the information from the website of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MSA), there is no company with the license yet. According to research from TokenInsight, MAS tends to give licenses to traditional financial institutions, although lots of new companies applied for the PSA license, including exchanges and wallets. Singapore is not having the same peaceful week as the crypto markets. The Singapore government approved an investment of $9,000,000 into blockchain research and development on Monday. Government-backed DBS Bank’s digital exchange will begin providing crypto trading services for institutional clients and accredited investors next week. Swiss digital exchange will also build a crypto exchange in Singapore with Japan’s SBI Holdings, slated for launch in 2022. On Thursday, Singapore published the Singapore Blockchain Ecosystem Report 2020, finding that blockchain is the breakthrough of financial services for Singapore. Singapore has applied blockchain to central bank digital currency (CBDC) research, business networks, AML/CFT, the first digital bond issuance, and other areas. Compared with Hong Kong and Tokyo, Singapore\u0027s advantages in IT technology have enabled it to succeed in the blockchain industry. In addition, according to anonymous sources, Singapore has already begun to take steps in compliance with crypto assets. It is believed that compliance related to digital asset transactions will be implemented in Singapore as soon as possible. However, unlike Hong Kong and Tokyo, Singapore can only rely on itself. Let us wait and see.

    "title": "Crypto Outperforms Traditional Markets With DEX Tokens Leading the Way: A Data Perspective by IntoTheBlock",
    "detailedContent": "Every week, IntoTheBlock brings you on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. This week, we analyze crypto’s sign of maturity as it weathers a storm hitting U.S. equities. Moreover, we dive into the upcoming catalysts crypto and DEX tokens in particular are set to benefit from in the short-term. Crypto Outperforms Macro Sell-Off With DEX Tokens Likely to Continue Despite traditional markets experiencing a significant correction, crypto has outperformed remaining close to its all-time highs. Over the past couple of weeks, major American stock indices such as the S\u0026P500 and the Nasdaq100 incurred losses while Bitcoin and Ethereum recorded gains. As of Mar. 2, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s capital markets insights The difference in behavior between crypto and traditional markets shows crypto evolving and acting again as an uncorrelated asset class after being highly correlated throughout most of 2020. This trend points to the consolidation of crypto as a separate asset class, less affected by turbulence in traditional markets. As of Mar. 2, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s capital markets insights Bitcoin’s correlation with major indices is for the most part relatively low (close to zero), while Ethereum does show slightly higher correlations as evidenced by the chart above. Interestingly enough, the correlation with the US dollar index has also declined in spite of crypto-assets often being denominated in dollars and the American currency gaining value in recent weeks. Despite the recent correction, markets are likely to be positively impacted by the upcoming $1.9 trillion stimulus package. Additionally, the $100 billion Coinbase IPO is also likely to generate traction for crypto markets, specifically for centralized and decentralized exchange (DEX) tokens. DEX Tokens Benefitted by Key Catalysts Though there are major differences between Coinbase and decentralized exchanges, they can be compared head to head in terms of trading volume (the vast majority of Coinbase\u0027s revenue comes from trading fees). Over the past week, Coinbase has traded on average $2.61 billion per day. In contrast, Uniswap has settled approximately $955 million per day, but at a significantly cheaper valuation of $16 billion. As of Mar. 10, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Uniswap Protocol Metrics To put the comparison clearly, Coinbase is currently trading at 38.31 times its daily trading volume, while Uniswap is valued at 16.75 times its volume. If UNI closes this gap versus Coinbase’s valuation, it could expect an increase of over 2.2x in price all else being equal, while SUSHI and BNT could grow even further to close this gap. Asides from the Coinbase IPO, stimulus checks coming within the next two weeks may further add to the risk-on momentum. As stocks recover from the recent correction, the risk-on sentiment appears to still be present as evidenced by Roblox’s recent IPO, with its $37 billion valuation pricing it over 40 times price-to-sales (P/S). In comparison, Uniswap, Bancor and SushiSwap are being priced at 25, 16 and 8 P/S ratios respectively. With the stimulus checks approaching, it would be surprising for these multiples not to expand. Blockchain data supports the trend of bullish positioning among investors in DEX tokens. Centralized exchange flows point to high amounts of UNI in particular being withdrawn. Netflows, which measure the amount of tokens being deposited into exchanges minus those being withdrawn, have reached a new low of $82 million in a day for UNI. In other words, $82 million more UNI were withdrawn than deposited into centralized exchanges on Mar. 8. The magnitude of UNI withdrawals from centralized exchanges points to the likelihood of recent investors opting to hold their positions and/or deposit them for extra yield in DeFi protocols. Moreover, UNI has also seen vast levels of trading activity amongst institutional players. IntoTheBlock’s large transactions volume, which tracks the aggregate volume sent across transfers of over $100,000, acts as a proxy for institutions’ and whales’ trading. As of Mar. 10, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s UNI financial indicators Large transactions volume for UNI recently took off to a new all-time high of over $5 billion. The increase in institutional activity coincided with a 10% increase in price, suggesting a high likelihood of large players buying the token. Overall, investors in DEX tokens appear to be showing signs of confidence. With Coinbase’s high valuation in its upcoming IPO and stimulus checks set to begin distribution, DEX tokens are poised to continue to grow.

    "detailedContent": "‍CoinMarketCap Earn, an educational program that teaches users about cryptocurrencies in exchange for crypto rewards, is launching their next Earn campaign with FIO Protocol. CoinMarketCap users can watch educational videos to learn about FIO Protocol, then test their knowledge with a short quiz — if they get the quiz answers correct, they will receive a reward in FIO tokens! This CoinMarketCap Earn campaign for FIO has a reward pool of 125,000 FIO (about $50,000). Successful quiz takers will receive 20 FIO (about $8 per user until the rewards pool runs out). What’s Up With Earn? For this earn campaign, only CMC users with Binance Know-Your-Customer-verified accounts BEFORE taking the campaign will be able to participate in the CoinMarketCap FIO Protocol campaign — this is to guarantee a smooth token distribution process for our quiz winners. While in the future, CoinMarketCap Earn campaigns may expand to using other exchanges, only Binance KYC accounts are able to receive FIO rewards in the FIO Protocol campaign. MAKE SURE THAT YOUR ACCOUNT IS ALREADY BINANCE KYC-VERIFIED BEFORE YOU COMPLETE THE QUIZ! We have made the decision to offer the Earn campaign to Binance KYC accounts due to the inherent blockchain risks for on-chain settlement of large rewards pools. The internal distribution of rewards by Binance to KYC-verified users helps ensure that the rewards are delivered in a safe and timely manner, as well as prevents fake accounts from taking rewards. Who’s Ready to Earn FIO? Before you can begin earning FIO, you must make an account on CoinMarketCap, which can easily be done right here. Once you’re in your CMC account, go to the CoinMarketCap FIO page to watch a series of educational videos about the project — and don’t forget to pay attention! Once you finish watching the videos, you will be able to take a short quiz — you can only take the quiz once, so it might be a good idea to take notes! If you successfully complete the quiz, you will receive 20 FIO (~$8) as a reward! What Is FIO? FIO Protocol is a blockchain protocol that aims to create a more efficient way of sending and receiving coins and tokens. FIO Protocol’s high level goal is to deliver usability for the entire blockchain ecosystem — similar to what HTTP did for the internet. FIO Protocol acts as a decentralized layer to the whole blockchain ecosystem, supplying workflow, data and confirmations leading up to transactions on other blockchains. However, the FIO Protocol does not actually interact directly with any other blockchain, but with a blockchain’s endpoints. The FIO token was made to pay for transactions on the blockchain. What Is Earn? CoinMarketCap Earn enables crypto enthusiasts to learn more about a particular cryptocurrency. Each user watches a series of educational videos about an asset, completes a quiz and is rewarded for their correct answers with crypto. With CoinMarketCap Earn, CMC can increase the breadth of knowledge about the crypto industry as part of its goal of showcasing the cryptocurrency revolution each step of the way. A CoinMarketCap account is required for users to participate in the educational CoinMarketCap Earn campaigns. Please remember that not all jurisdictions are supported at this time, so confirm that your jurisdiction is supported by checking out our FAQ section.

    "title": "Right on the DOT - Polkadot and On-Chain Intelligence: Flipside Crypto",
    "detailedContent": "What’s Up With DOT? Polkadot offers a solution to one of the most pressing challenges facing Ethereum: scalability. At the time of writing, the Ethereum network handles about 15 transactions per second. We can validate this with the help of Etherscan and some simple math: Figure 1. Ethereum Daily Transactions A total of 1,277,890 transactions occurred this past Sunday. Divided by 86,400 seconds in a day, this yields ~14.8 transactions per second. By contrast, credit card payment systems process thousands of transactions per second. Not a good look for Ethereum 1.0. If you’ve ever heard of sharding — this is the problem it’s intended to solve (1). In the current version of Ethereum, every node — that is, every computer participating in the Ethereum network — has to process every transaction in the entire history of the blockchain in order to validate transactions. Polkadot provides an alternative to Ethereum 2.0, although it is not a direct competitor. Dr. Gavin Wood, who co-founded Ethereum and created Polkadot, highlights a number of conceptual differences between Polkadot and Ethereum 2.0. In his own words, “Polkadot...is built to be a largely future-proof harness able to assimilate new blockchain technology as it becomes available without over-complicated decentralised coordination of hard forks (3).\" With that said, Polkadot also uses sharding to address a number of blockchain architecture challenges (4). It establishes a main chain, the “relay chain,” to which separate shards or “parachains” can connect. The relay chain is a proof-of-stake (PoS) system; in conjunction with validators, it provides security to the various parachains and enables on-chain governance. Polkadot launched in May 2020, drawing attention from well-known projects such as Chainlink (5). According to Dr. Wood’s year-end review of the Polkadot ecosystem, “Polkadot is now the 2nd most active DeFi ecosystem after Ethereum (and growing fast) (6)”. Retail investors have taken note in 2021; year-to-date, DOT is up nearly 400%. Figure 2. DOT Price, Year-To-Date (2021) CoinMarketCap, https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polkadot-new/ Polkadot: A Healthy Developer Community Each blockchain is unique, and Polkadot’s blend of complexity and innovation makes it especially difficult for non-experts to understand. One way to approach complex projects like Polkadot is on-chain intelligence, which uses data gathered from a project blockchain itself to provide rich insights and enable comparisons with other projects. For example, analyzing blockchain data enables viewers to compare the activity of developer communities. Looking at Polkadot, we see that its recent developer activity compares favorably to the cream of the crop — the top-ranking projects in the crypto universe. A high developer score means that a project has an active developer community: a large number of contributors making regular updates. While projects may vary widely in technical architecture and goals, developer activity provides a common and easily understood metric by which projects can be compared, e.g. how many people are contributing to a project’s health and feature set? Here’s a granular look at developer contributions. The key takeaway is that Polkadot shows consistent contributions (i.e. surges of activity), indicating a dedicated developer community that stays committed to the project over time. Figure 4. Developer Contributions to Polkadot Metrics, like price, are reactive — they can tell you that a large number of buyers have become interested in purchasing tokens. A better standard to examine when assessing a project is: does it have an active, engaged community of developers who are committed to making the project better by adding features and addressing vulnerabilities? By that standard, Polkadot is an excellent example of a project that has attracted regular developer activity over time — and is now enjoying its moment in the limelight as a result.

    "title": "How to Use CoinMarketCap Watchlists",
    "detailedContent": "Don\u0027t have time to read? Check our video instead! ⬇️ CoinMarketCap\u0027s watchlist feature is a great way to keep track of all of your favorite coins and tokens. Instead of having to toggle through multiple tabs and manually check out prices, you can add coins you are interested in to a customized watchlist and check on the market in one place! Your watchlist will sync between your mobile app and your laptop, making sure that you always know how your coins are doing. Before using the CoinMarketCap watchlist, you’ll need to create an account or log in to your existing account. How to Make the Best Use of CoinMarketCap’s Watchlist Now, it’s time to start using the new watchlist! Here is a step-by-step guide to using the CoinMarketCap watchlist. Step 1: Create Your Own Watchlist You can build your own watchlist from these following spots: ‍From the watchlist page: When you go to the main page of watchlist, you can add coins from an empty page: Or from the “+Add Coins” button on the upper right corner: Once you click on the add coin buttons, you can search your favorite coins from the pop-up:‍ - You can also add coins from the coin listings page from the ⭐️ in the front of a coin when you browse - ⭐️s also appear on coin detail pages — when you check out the details of a coin and find it interesting, you can also add that coin directly to your watchlist. Please note if you add coins from the coin listings pages, coins will only be added to the “Main” watchlist (this will be explained below)! Step 2: Customize Your Watchlist You can also customize how you want to view your watchlist with our new beta customization options. Pick the top 12 most important metrics and see how your watchlist changes! Step 3: Share Your Watchlist and Follow Other Watchlists On CMC, you can make your watchlist public or private! If you make a private watchlist, that\u0027s just for you to look at your favorite coins\u0027 price from the comfort of your own home. If you decide to go public, you can attract followers who are interested to see what you are watching. Give your public watchlist a catchy name and description if you want to bring on more followers. You can share your watchlist with the public right on the page, by pressing the \"Share\" button. No matter if your watchlists are private or public, you can easily follow as many public watchlists as you can find! You can find new watchlists (and see which watchlists you are already following) by looking at the Following or Popular tabs. Other CoinMarketCap Watchlist Features Our CMC watchlist feature provides other features that make watching top coins very easy. Multiple watchlists: you can now create more than one watchlist! You can use watchlists for different purposes, like one for DeFi, one for storage and more! Remember that you can give each watchlist a unique name and description so you know what they are about! You can edit the name and description from “... More” button: You can also create new watchlists, or switch to other watchlists from the dropdown next to the watchlist name: ‍Note that there will always need to be one “Main” watchlist amongst your watchlists. This main watchlist will be your default watchlist — when you add coins from ⭐️s mentioned above, it will only be added to the main watchlist. When you go to the watchlist page, this will be the first watchlist shown to you. By default, the main watchlist is set to be the first watchlist you created; however you can swap it anytime in the “... More” list: From here, you can also duplicate/copy a watchlist, or remove/delete a watchlist. If you have an older watchlist... If you have been using our watchlist feature before our latest upgrade, there are two ways of storing your watchlist — either on your local machine (laptop, desktop) or stored with your account. If we detect that you have local stored watchlist data existing, we’ll require you to make a decision of how we should deal with the old data when you first arrive on the new watchlist. There will be three options for you: Merge watchlists: if this option is selected, we will take your local watchlist + account-stored watchlist and make it one watchlist for your future use. Keep local watchlist: if this option is selected, we will then discard your account watchlist and only keep your local watchlist for your future use. Keep account watchlist: if this option is selected, same idea as the previous option that only your account watchlist will be kept. Please note once the decision is made, the data cannot be restored — so make your choice carefully! Reminder: the difference between your “local” watchlist and your “account” watchlist is that one was stored just on your laptop, while the other was associated with your account — under the new watchlist, you’ll have just one watchlist across all devices! Enjoy watching!",

    "detailedContent": "As reflected by the option-related signals on Monday, the performance of mainstream digital assets has shown obvious different trends. Ethereum once again returned to an all time high, while Bitcoin continued to trade sideways at a high level and has not yet achieved a decisive breakthrough. After experiencing the upsurge of NFT, non-Ethereum public chain, on-chain storage and other sectors, investors turned their attention back to the trading sector. The good news in asset trading this week has continued: BTG (Bitcoin Gold) announced its cooperation with Phala Network to build a cross-chain bridge between the Bitcoin network and the Polkadot network, KuCoin Exchange announced the introduction of Stellar deposit and withdrawal services, and the Indian Exchange WazirX announced the launch of the NFT trading market, the first time for a centralized exchange. Stimulated by a lot of good news, trading-related tokens rose as a whole. Bitcoin Callback, Ethereum New High Bitcoin and Ethereum no longer advance at the same time, at least for now. Obviously, the market’s interest in Bitcoin trading is further declining: as of Apr. 9, the weekly trading volume of Bitcoin spot was only 56.5 billion U.S. dollars, while the weekly trading volume of perpetual contracts was 410.6 billion U.S. dollars, a decrease of more than 10%. The decline for Bitcoin was sustained and obvious; while Ethereum was the complete opposite, spot and perpetual contract trading volumes increased by 32.29% and 47.60%, respectively. Changes in the trading volume of Bitcoin and Ethereum in the past 30 days, as of 16:00 on Apr. 9, source: tokeninsight.com The volatility data further showed some additional signals. Whether it is a Bitcoin spot or perpetual contract, its historical volatility has been in a continuous downward trend, and it is now close to 50, a new low this year. The price stability means that speculators are gradually decreasing, but it also means that as speculators gradually lose interest in Bitcoin, the vitality of the market has declined. Historical volatility chart of Bitcoin spot and perpetual contracts since the beginning of the year, source: gvol.io The Ethereum market remains dynamic: the volatility has begun to \"bottom up,\" and the overall volatility level remains above 60, which is much higher than Bitcoin. In addition, from the perspective of options trading in the past week, small option contracts have become the main force in the allocation of rights in this cycle, which confirms the recent activity in the Ethereum market: most small option allocators are individual investors. When option allocation occupies the absolute mainstream, market enthusiasm is often relatively sufficient. Changes in the historical volatility of Ethereum spot and perpetual contracts and changes in the trading volume of Ethereum options in the past 30 days, source: gvol.io Mainstream digital asset transactions this week, source: tokeninsight.com XRP Soars and the Trading Token Sector Takes the Lead When Ripple was sued by the SEC, almost all investors believed that this project, which once occupied the fourth largest market capitalization in the digital asset market, had seen its end. However, its token XRP, after experiencing a drop to US$0.25, has risen to more than US$1 since February, breaking a record high since 2021. At the peak of the daily trading volume, it also reached US$10.21 billion with the price surge. XRP price changes in the past 90 days, source: tokeninsight.com As one of the leaders in the payment and transaction industry, Ripple\u0027s successful \"resurrection\" has driven the long-silent trading token sector to rise. Whether it is cross-chain, high-speed trading public chain or exchange new business, the corresponding tokens are greatly stimulated up. As of 5:30 pm on Apr. 9, the total market value of XRP reached US$46.79 billion, an increase of 78.09% compared to last week. The market value distribution of exchange certificates KCS and STX reached US$1.1 billion and US$2.2 billion, and the best performing token is Bitcoin Gold, which has recently announced to join the Bitcoin-Polkadot cross-chain project. Although it is only a legacy of the Bitcoin hard fork that year, the current token price of the project is affected by cross-chain benefits. The current market value is close to 2 billion US dollars. This is an increase of 174.75% from last week. Trading is the core of the digital asset market, and related certificates can be regarded as long-term investment targets. However, because the short-term performance is often inferior to project certificates such as NFTs, its related transactions have been ignored by investors, especially individual investors. However, a large number of blue chip tokens are hidden in trading tokens, so dividing a part of the investment portfolio into non-mainstream trading tokens for long-term holding may have a positive effect on optimizing the long-term performance of the investment portfolio.

    "title": "8 Key Women in Crypto — In Honor of International Women’s Day",
    "detailedContent": "Recent research from eToro suggests only 15% of Bitcoin traders are women — powerfully illustrating the gender imbalance that exists in the world of cryptocurrencies. Nonetheless, there are reasons to be optimistic. A report from Gemini indicates that, among those who are planning to invest in crypto, 40% are female. Better still, a greater number of women are making an impact in high-profile positions throughout the digital assets sector — and this representation will be crucial for enacting change at every level of the industry. March 8 is International Women’s Day — and this year’s theme is Choose to Challenge. To celebrate, let’s shine a spotlight on eight women with a prominent voice in crypto. This isn’t a countdown, nor an exhaustive list, but it’s an impressive collection of professionals. 1. Hester Peirce, SEC commissioner Affectionately known as “Crypto Mom” by many in the sector, Hester Peirce is an SEC commissioner who is playing an instrumental role in delivering a regulatory framework for digital assets. Working alongside the new chairman Gary Gensler, Peirce began her second five-year term in the role last August — meaning she’ll be in her post until 2025. Peirce has won plaudits by being passionate about delivering clarity for the crypto industry — something that she believes is crucial for fostering innovation in the space. She strikes a refreshing tone in speeches about the digital economy, too. Speaking last month at George Washington University Law School, she said: “We tend to look at technological innovation in the markets with deep suspicion, and that mindset has to change.” She was also full of praise for the DeFi sector, adding: “Although a work in progress with all the growing pains and rough edges that implies, DeFi’s promises of democratization, open access, transparency, predictability, and systemic resilience are alluring.” 2. Ria Bhutoria, Fidelity Digital Assets research director As a research director at Fidelity Digital Assets, Ria Bhutoria is delivering razor-sharp analysis of what’s happening in the crypto markets and why — all while helping to address some of the persistent criticisms surrounding Bitcoin. One of her coolest innovations has been the “FUD Fort” — a carefully cultivated list of articles that helps to address some of the biggest areas of fear, uncertainty and doubt that proliferate in the crypto space…surrounding the environment, manipulation, limited throughput, illicit activity, volatility and everything in between. Bhutoria also shares pearls of wisdom on her Twitter page, writing last month: “I have never regretted buying more Bitcoin and I have always regretted not buying more Bitcoin.” If you’re looking for a way to make sense of what’s going on, her posts serve as essential reading. 3. Camila Russo, The Defiant founder For outsiders, some areas of the crypto sector — especially decentralized finance — can be exceedingly confusing to follow. Camila Russo is one journalist who has been making remarkable in-roads in demystifying this space for all of us. Formerly a reporter at Bloomberg, she went on to write an in-depth book that told the story of Ethereum. She’s now launched The Defiant — a media outlet that tracks DeFi’s story through a website, a newsletter, YouTube videos and a podcast. We’ve even been lucky enough to welcome Camila to CoinMarketCap Academy, where she wrote this brilliant deep dive into DeFi — chronicling its evolution from a Telegram chat between developers and entrepreneurs to a bustling sector that now has a total value locked of about $40 billion. 4. Elizabeth Stark, Lightning Labs CEO and co-founder Bitcoin can only handle about five transactions a second, but Elizabeth Stark is spearheading an effort to make BTC payments far faster and cheaper than they are now. She’s the CEO of Lightning Labs, the company behind a layer 2 solution for Bitcoin that ultimately aims to serve as a Visa-inspired network for the cryptocurrency. Although the technology is still being finessed, it could prove essential in ensuring that Bitcoin can be used widely as a payment method — and all without the blockchain suffering the same levels of congestion that Ethereum does. 5. Caitlin Long, Avanti Financial Group founder and CEO After an illustrious career at Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, Caitlin Long has now set her sights on the world of blockchain. This year, she’s set to launch a new bank called Avanti, which aims to serve institutional customers and high net worth individuals. Her financial institution is based in Wyoming, and she serves on the state’s Blockchain Select Committee. Long says that Avanti aims to offer a “critical” piece of infrastructure that’s currently missing from the market — a regulated bank that can provide crypto custody services. She argues that pension funds, corporations and other entities need this to exist before they can gain exposure to Bitcoin in any meaningful way. 6. Kristin Smith, Blockchain Association executive director Kristin Smith runs the Blockchain Association — and is focused on helping the crypto industry to develop “a strategic roadmap for public policy.” It’s a role she’s exceedingly qualified for after working in House and Senate offices at a senior level, as well as private sector experience in advocating for telecoms companies. The association’s goal is to help tackle some of the regulatory hurdles that stop entrepreneurs from innovating — and support lawmakers who have to take security concerns and consumer protection into account. 7. Sheila Warren, World Economic Forum head of blockchain and data policy With attitudes towards crypto and blockchain shifting, and the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos crucial for shaping opinion, Sheila Warren’s role as head of blockchain and data policy at the WEF is a significant one. She recently set out a series of predictions for 2021 — writing: “It is likely that financial institutions and service providers will intensify their own experiments with, and use of, cryptocurrency this year, whether via investment or actual deployment.” Warren also believes that there will be great strides in unlocking the potential of non-fungible tokens, and plenty of exploration surrounding the merits of decentralization. 8. Christine Lagarde, European Central Bank president Although Christine Lagarde isn’t working specifically in the crypto sector, she has a tremendous amount of influence in its future — especially when it comes to Bitcoin regulation, and whether Europe will push ahead with plans to launch its own central bank digital currency. It’s fair to say the seasoned central banker isn’t a fan of BTC — and last month, she didn’t mince her words in proclaiming that the ECB won’t be holding the cryptocurrency in reserve, describing such a development as “out of the question.” However, in September 2019, Lagarde had said that central banks and regulators should recognize the social benefits of technological innovations like digital currencies and allow the space to develop.",

    "detailedContent": "‍The steady volatility did not bring about the price increase as expected. Affected by the uncertainty of macro factors, both institutions and individuals were waiting-and-seeing. In the spot market, Ethereum\u0027s trading volume fell sharply by $25.33 billion, close to half of last week. Bitcoin\u0027s trading volume also declined. A similar situation appeared in the derivatives market, whether it was futures or options, the trading volume came to a low ebb period. From some indicators, professional investors still maintain a positive attitude towards Ethereum and its DeFi ecosystem in the short term, betting on the performance of Ethereum after the upgrade in the middle of the year. For Bitcoin, professional investors tend to believe it to be bearish considering the macro factors. Low Volatility: Mainstream Cryptocurrencies Lack Momentum for Upward Breakthroughs Bitcoin price changes in the past 30 days, as of 4: 00 on June 18, source: tokeninsight.com One month has passed since the Black Swan incident that occurred on May 19th. Although volatility has fallen to \"near-normal\" levels, the price of Bitcoin remains below $40,000 most of the time. Since last month, supervision, interest rate hike expectations, and table shrinkage expectations have followed one after another, which is the reason for the continued wait-and-see of the market. Although a small amount of good news was released in the short term, its stimulating effect on the market tends to last for a short time. Year-to-date changes in Bitcoin index price and perpetual contract price volatility, source: gvol.io As the expectation of interest rate hikes has gradually become clear, from the perspective of skewness, the sentiment of bearish Bitcoin has always continued: regardless of the short-term, medium-term, and long-term, the skewness is still negative, which indicates that the bearish sentiment for Bitcoin is still continued to be included in options pricing. Changes in Bitcoin options skewness in the past year, source: gvol.io At the same time, in the futures market, the high premium of Bitcoin futures no longer exists. From the pricing of Bitcoin futures on OKEx, it can be found that the premium of forward futures generally does not exceed 10%, while the price of futures due in the near future is even slightly lower. The current price indicates that bearish sentiment in the Bitcoin market is spreading, and a certain consensus has been reached in the derivatives market. Bitcoin futures prices on OKEx, as of 3:00 on June 18th, source: okex.com In terms of trading volume, both Bitcoin spot and perpetual contract trading volumes have declined compared to last week, but they are much better than Ethereum, which has a heavier wait-and-see sentiment. In the exchanges tracked by Tokeninsight this week, Bitcoin spot trading volume was approximately $65.91 billion, while perpetual contract volume was $458.8 billion. In contrast, the weekly spot volume of Ethereum fell to $37.47 billion, while the weekly volume of perpetual contracts fell to $145.8 billion. Speculators seem to be concentrating their chips on Bitcoin to bet on recent macroeconomic trends to profit. For Ethereum, the signals from the derivatives market are different. Investors in the options market have higher expectations for Ethereum taking into account the relatively solid fundamentals of Ethereum. This makes the implied volatility be higher than the historical volatility of Ethereum, and the volatility skewness continues to be negative this week -- based on past experience, this is usually a signal that \"asset prices are undervalued\". Professional investors still maintain a positive attitude towards Ethereum and its DeFi ecosystem in the short term. The historical volatility and implied volatility of Ethereum in the past 30 days, source: gvol.io As for the whole market, the impact of macro factors is greater than the impact of fundamentals: Although asset prices continue to be undervalued, investors are still waiting-and-seeing. Under the background of the low ebb brought by macro factors, many investors hope to obtain the opportunity to acquire high-quality assets at a low price, while the seller will not choose to sell it at a low price. The game and see-saw between the two sides has led to the new low on trading volume of Ethereum in nearly a month. Ethereum trading volume changes in the past 30 days, as of 3:00 on June 18, source: tokeninsight.com Similarly, due to the influence of macro factors transmitted to Ethereum and then transmitted to the DeFi market for a second time, this week, the market value of several major project tokens, such as UNI, SOL, KSM, etc., has shrunk to a certain extent. Among them, the market value of Polkadot\u0027s Kusama testnet has shrunk by 26.3% this week and is now $2.85 billion, while other projects have fallen by less than 20%. However, most mainstream projects are in a slow downward trend, and the wait-and-see sentiment has caused certain adverse effects on the DeFi market. KSM token price changes in the past 7 days, source: tokeninsight.com From the perspective of the futures market, the pricing of Ethereum futures by futures investors is more affected by macro factors. The price of forward futures due for delivery at the end of the year has been lower than $2,400, which has not generated enough premium due to fundamentals. Bitcoin futures prices on OKEx as of 3:30 on June 18th, source: okex.com Focus on the \"Great Delivery Day\" June 25 is the mid-year \"Great Delivery Day\" of the derivatives market. Options and futures of the current quarter, second quarter, current month, and next month will be concentrated on this day for centralized settlement and delivery, which often brings large spot price fluctuations, or may also increase volatility. In a bull market, the impact of delivery on the market is not obvious. However, in a downward market, derivatives delivery often triggers a price drop on the Thursday before delivery, and the price slowly recovers after the delivery is completed. The scale of delivery on June 25 can be said to be the largest so far: Ethereum options contract alone will have more than 580,000 expire on this day, and Bitcoin will also have more than 65,000 options contracts expire on this day. At the same time, the allocation of derivatives positions for the third quarter and the second half of the year will also occur around that date. The above events may cause major fluctuations in the prices of mainstream crypto assets. Ethereum options contracts open interest, source: gvol.io Bitcoin options contract open interest, source: gvol.io The underestimation of the price of Ethereum may continue until around the delivery date. The reason is that the low valuation period is usually a good time for derivatives allocation, which can control risks at a lower cost and obtain more benefits. For Bitcoin, there are currently no positive signals, so its price may follow the current range (between $35,000-$40,000) until around the delivery date. However, due to the increased uncertainty in the macro market, the \"Great Delivery Day\" of derivatives will also bring higher uncertainty, and investors are gradually becoming conservative: currently in the options market, more than half of investors have adopted the \"sell strategy\" to counter the price declines.

    "detailedContent": "Affected by the macro market turbulence, the volatility of mainstream cryptos has risen, but they are still in the low volatility range. The rebound in market risk appetite has pushed up the prices of commodities and crypto assets, but whether the market will pick up still needs to wait for the end of July to determine. Market Confidence Recovered With More Potential Volatility Earlier this week, due to the panic caused by the rebound of the epidemic, the stock market and bulk commodities all fell sharply, affecting the crypto market. News related to the regulation of stablecoins further lowered the market\u0027s expectations for the crypto market. On Tuesday, the price of BTC fell below $30,000 for the first time, and the market was bearish. The put/call ratio of ETH options once reached 1.7. But beginning on Wednesday, the B Word online summit strongly supported the market bulls, and the crypto market institutions rebounded. The prices of cryptos has recovered and the volatility has begun to rise. As of Friday, the historical volatility of Bitcoin has rebounded to the 60 moving average, while the historical volatility of Ethereum has rebounded to above the 80 moving average, which is conducive to the operation of volatility-related strategies. Market confidence has also recovered. The recent skewness of the mainstream cryptos has risen significantly, indicating that optimism has begun to be included in the pricing. The negative basis rate of the next week and the front-month futures has been wiped out, and the recent bitcoin futures even have a small positive premium. However, since a series of economic indicators and data will be announced at the end of the month, and next week will be the monthly settlement period for derivatives, market volatility may further increase, and it is necessary to pay attention to the risk of price fluctuations in the short term. Changes in the volatility of Bitcoin and Ethereum in the past 30 days, Source: gvol.io Macroeconomic Factors Dominate the Crypto Market Temporarily This week, the impact of macroeconomic factors on the market is higher than that of supervision, but the long-term layout and plan of the supervisory agency still cannot be ignored. Annual basis premium of main crypto futures in Deribit, Source: gvol.io U.S. government agencies and regulators have begun to develop a regulatory framework for stablecoins and DeFi, and are trying to push individual investors away from the crypto asset trading market. On July 19, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued a serious warning against crypto assets such as Bitcoin and told individuals not to participate in it. The FBI stated that cybercriminals targeted cryptocurrency users, exchanges and third-party payment platforms in the crypto industry, causing massive economic losses to victims. On July 20th, US Treasury Secretary Yellen convened US regulators to discuss stablecoin rules. At the meeting, participants discussed the rapid growth of stablecoins, the potential use of stablecoins as a means of payment, and potential risks to end users, financial systems, and national security. The U.S. Financial Markets Working Group also listened to an introduction from the Department of the Treasury on the preparation of the stablecoin report. The report discussed the potential benefits and risks of stablecoins, the current regulatory framework in the United States, and suggestions for resolving regulatory gaps. The working group is expected to issue recommendations in the coming months. On July 21, SEC Chairman Gensler stated that even on a decentralized platform, cryptocurrencies priced in securities must comply with securities regulations. European regulators have proposed a ban on anonymous cryptocurrency transactions, but the short-term impact is not significant. As part of the plan to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, the European Union proposes to ban anonymous cryptocurrency transactions. The plan announced on July 20 includes a number of proposals to strengthen financial transaction supervision, including the creation of a new EU institution with about 250 people to supervise high-risk financial institutions, and a ban on cash transactions exceeding 10,000 euros. The European Union said it would ban anonymous crypto asset wallets. The European Commission stated that it should impose the same regulations on cryptocurrencies as regular bank wire transfers. The plan must be approved by the European Parliament and the European Council, and the process may be lengthy. The EU stated that the goal is to start operating a new anti-money laundering agency in 2024. Although the crypto market suffered a series of blows in Q2, since the Q3, market confidence has shown signs of recovery. CNBC reported that despite the setbacks of cryptocurrencies, blockchain companies received a total of $4.4B in financing in the second quarter. Global X Bitcoin Trust stated that in order to achieve its investment goals, the trust will hold Bitcoin. This week, the cryptocurrency exchange FTX announced a financing of $900M, one of the largest financings this quarter, and its valuation has reached $18B. Although the crypto market is showing signs of recovery, as the Fed’s interest rate resolution and other important economic information will be announced next week, the volatility of the macro market will increase significantly. The volatility at the beginning of this week proves the increasingly close correlation between the crypto market and the macro economy, which requires continuous attention to the macro market situation. Trading in response to macro expectations will dominate the crypto market this week and next week. It is expected that the volatility of the crypto market will increase with macro fluctuations, but the increase is limited and will remain at a low-to-medium level in the short term.

    "title": "Bitcoin Bounces Around $50,000 With Mixed Signals: A Data Perspective by IntoTheBlock",
    "detailedContent": "Every week, IntoTheBlock brings you on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. This week, we dive into Bitcoin’s rebound towards the $50,000 price tag despite metrics pointing to new buyers slowing down. We also take a look at the price levels to watch out for based on blockchain buying activity. Bitcoin Remains Within Key Price Range with Mixed Signals Following a 25% correction from $58,000 to $43,000, Bitcoin has bounced back towards $50,000. The recent rebound has come along with news and speculation as per usual. In regards to news, Reuters recently reported that Goldman Sachs is planning to reopen its cryptocurrency desk, after shutting it down in 2018. The trading desk is expected to launch at some point this month, giving yet another stamp of approval from Wall Street to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Similarly, a well-known Bitcoin skeptic has appeared to also have changed his mind on Bitcoin. Kevin O’Leary, best known for his role as a Shark Tank investor, decided to allocate 3% of his portfolio into Bitcoin just a couple of months after calling it a “giant nothing-burger.” Additionally, speculation on Twitter adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet was sparked by its recent $1.25 billion convertible note. Though there is no mention of crypto in the official announcement, the crypto community took it as a potential sign of the social media giant looking to invest in Bitcoin following MicroStrategy’s similar move and Jack Dorsey’s investment and support through Square. Speculation aside, Bitcoin’s on-chain data provide valuable insights into its current situation. The number of addresses being created, new addresses, are indicative of the level of interest from new entrants. This indicator just hit a six-month low for Bitcoin following its retracement. As of Mar. 2, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin network indicators A similar image is reflected in the Google searches for Bitcoin: after reaching yearly highs in early January, the number of searches for the term Bitcoin have slowed down despite its price continuing to climb. As of Mar. 2, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin social indicators While new interest may be slowing down, it does not necessarily mean that the buying activity has stopped altogether as existing players may continue to accumulate. This trend also contrasts the recent report about Goldman Sachs reopening its crypto trading desk, which creates mixed signals that may leave investors uncertain about what Bitcoin’s next step is. By looking into the positioning of investors that bought near the current price, we obtain a better understanding of near-term forces at play. IntoTheBlock’s In/Out of the Money Around Price (IOMAP) analyzes the profitability of addresses that previously bought within 15% of the current price and is useful to understand levels of support and resistance based on blockchain data. In short, the IOMAP labels clusters of addresses as in the money if their average investment price is below the current price, meaning that they are profiting on paper from their investment. As of Mar. 2, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Bitcoin financial indicators Currently, the IOMAP indicates a large cluster of addresses (970K) and volume (403K BTC) had been bought slightly below $50,000. This price range, which already saw high levels of trading activity, is expected to act as strong resistance short-term as investors in this price range may look to break-even on their positions at this point. On the other hand, the IOMAP points to strong support between $45,400 to $46,800, where previously 956K addresses bought a total of 598K BTC. The high amount of trading activity at this range points to the likelihood of investors looking to buy back near this range and create support before price lowers further. Ultimately, a break past $45,000 may mean Bitcoin will retrace further, while a breakout past $50,000 may suggest it is poised for new highs. These are the levels to watch out for before being certain of the correction being over or not.

    "detailedContent": "A large fluctuation came this week. Under short-term operations, Bitcoin fell from a high of $58,000 to about $45,000, detonating panic in the market, and other cryptos such as exchange tokens and mainstream tokens plummeted at the same time, and the average decline this week was over 10%. However, in the panic, new blue-chip tokens began to be discovered: Solana series tokens, old brand public chain Cardano, DAG public chain Fantom, etc. have become rookies who have bucked the trend in this round of volatility. Behind every market turmoil, there are new investment opportunities hidden. Hedging and Big Shocks: Mainstream Cryptos Plummet The downtrend started by shorts this week has been going on for nearly a week. After rising to the peak of US$58,000, so far, Bitcoin has fallen to near the US$46,000 line, giving up all the gains since the Chinese New Year. Bitcoin price \u0026 volume in the last 30 days, chart from 1:00am EST, Feb. 26. Source: tokeninsight.com The sharp drop of Bitcoin triggered panic across the market, and speculation was quietly spreading. On the one hand, companies such as Microstrategy took advantage of the low prices to start large-scale acquisitions of various cryptos, and the Whalesmap showed that the Bitcoin whales sold 140,000 Bitcoin during this fluctuation, which worth over $7B. On the other hand, the lack of market confidence caused by Bitcoin\u0027s sharp call back has caused other cryptos to suffer severe setbacks at the same time. As of 1:00 am on Feb. 26, the price of ETH had fallen by 23.11% this week, BNB had fallen by 10.8%, and non-mainstream cryptos’ prices such as Litecoin and BCH have fallen by more than a quarter. Panic has also triggered a massive wave of selling, or general “FOMO.” The weekly Bitcoin spot trading volume reached $112.56B, an increase of 56.36% compared to last week, and the daily trading volume on Tuesday and Wednesday exceeded $25B, reaching the highest trading level during the market turmoil in January. A similar situation has occurred in mainstream cryptos such as Ethereum. Bitcoin spot trading volume in the last 90 days, chart from 1:00am EST, Feb. 26. Source: tokeninsight.com How long will this round of fluctuation last? It\u0027s hard to judge. It is certain that we still seem to be in a bull market, for the price of cryptos is still at its peak, and various projects are constantly emerging, obtaining financing and issuing tokens. From the perspective of the options market, the market still maintains a relatively optimistic attitude towards Bitcoin: investors generally believe that Bitcoin will return to around $50,000 in the near future, but for the medium and long term, from the perspective of skew, the market attitude tends to be stable and optimistic, and this is incorporated into the pricing of options. The recent skew distribution of the Bitcoin options. Source: gvol.io However, investors don’t have much bullish sentiment for Ethereum. Affected by the public chains of exchanges such as BSC and Heco and competitors of public chains such as Solana and Polkadot, the problems of Ethereum\u0027s higher gas fees and lower transaction speed have gradually been exposed. Although Ethereum 2.0 is still being deployed in an orderly manner, in the background of the bull market, investors still have a certain degree of skepticism about Ethereum’s future and the benefits that it can bring. These sentiments are also reflected in the skew: the short-term and medium-term skew of Ethereum options shows that the bearish attitude towards Ethereum currently has the upper hand.

Source: gvol.io ‘The Surfing Club’: New Blue Chip Tokens Rise Against the Trend In the sorrows of the market, there are still a few tokens that have withstood the pressure and maintained their upward momentum. Among the exchanges tokens, the market value of OKB and KCS has increased by more than 35% this week, Uniswap rose by 8.5%, and its circulating market value (based on the UNI in circulation) reached $6.736B, which is the best performance in the DeFi exchanges. UNI, OKB and KCS price in the last 7 days, chart from 2:00am EST, Feb. 26. Source: tokeninsight.com The best performing blue chip tokens this week came from non-Ethereum public chains, including Solana, Fantom and Cardano. As an old brand public chain, Cardano has remained stable during this fluctuation. The market value of its token ADA rose by 10.75% to $31.243B. The highlights of this week are Solana and Fantom. The price of Solana’s token SOL rose to 46.96%, reaching $13.55, with a market value of $3.54B. Fantom’s token FTM performed best, with an increase of over 167%, and the current market value has entered The top 50 in the crypto market was $1.38B. SOL and FTM price in the last 7 days, chart from 2:00am EST, Feb 26. Source: tokeninsight.com It is worth noting that the two public chains are inextricably linked with FTX and Alamanda Research. As a major investment project of Alamanda Research, the Solana public chain with its on-chain applications and Fantom are all important roles of FTX in the layout of the DeFi market as planned. This week, Solana and the issued tokens of representative applications on the chain have achieved varying degrees of rise. Taking the decentralized exchanges Serum as an example, its exchange-token SRM has risen by 47.62% this week. As an important competitor of Ethereum, Solana performed very strongly in the first quarter of 2021. Considering the issues of gas fees and transaction efficiency, Ethereum is no longer considered the only option for investors and developers. With the gradual maturity of the non-Ethereum public chain, a large number of decentralized applications began to launch on the non-Ethereum public chain and began to gradually break the original market structure. Following Polkadot, dozens of new projects and new public chains will emerge in 2021. In the context of market turmoil, investment in non-mainstream public chains and their projects on the chain is a new profitable direction.

    "detailedContent": "Every week IntoTheBlock brings you on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. This week, we focus on the crypto-assets leading in 2021 so far and potential reasons for their outstanding performance. With Ether reaching new all-time highs, we dive into factors pushing Ethereum and other smart contract platforms higher, as well as decentralized finance (DeFi) applications built on top of them. “Alt Season” Being Led by Smart Contract Platforms \u0026 DeFi The so-called Alt Season has arrived, as cryptoassets with smaller market capitalization than Bitcoin are outperforming the market. Despite the fact that only three weeks have passed in 2021, many cryptoassets have already seen triple-digit growth. By analyzing the top performers year-to-date, we observe that the majority of the gains are being realized by smart contract platforms and DeFi applications: The table above displays the top 10 highest returning cryptoassets so far in 2021. The dominance of smart contract platforms and DeFi is evident, with Stellar being the only exception (though they do support limited smart contract functionality). As of Jan. 19, 2020 through IntoTheBlock’s DeFi Insights DeFi tokens in particular have enjoyed remarkable growth over the last month, with their aggregate market cap doubling from $10 billion to $20 billion. These protocols have been favored by a market currently centered around opportunities with high potential. There are two likely reasons for smart contract platforms’ and DeFi’s leading returns: the market’s risk-on stance and the increasing demand for censorship resistance. Risk-On Market Realizes the Value of Censorship Resistance The risk-on positioning from the market can be observed from the high returns of volatile assets such as crypto. This positioning is linked to the upcoming $1.9 trillion stimulus package in the United States, which has increased forecasts for economic growth in the largest economy. Due to this and the federal reserves’ plans to keep interest rates at zero for the foreseeable future, stocks and risky assets have rallied. In particular, assets with high potential growth such as space exploration (e.g. Virgin Galactic), electric vehicles (Tesla), next-generation finance (DeFi) and decentralized infrastructure. Decentralization has also gained momentum amidst unprecedented censorship. Following the incitement of violence from former U.S. president Donald Trump, social media platforms permanently banned him. Similarly, social network Parler was kicked off Amazon Web Services following the incident. As a result, Google search results for “censorship” worldwide reached a five-year high. As of Jan. 19, 2020 (6PM EST) via Google Trends In light of the attention surrounding censorship, blockchain technology has been brought up by many as a potential solution. In short, public blockchain allows censorship-resistance as it is not controlled by one single entity or group of entities, but rather by a decentralized network. As the crypto venture fund Paradigm’s cofounder Matt Huang implies, the increased censorship highlights the value proposition of a decentralized web built on top of smart contract platforms. Overall, crypto holders by and large profited from their assets thus far in 2021. As speculation in crypto increases, we see risk-on positioning accompanied by a growing proposition for decentralization as drivers in the recent run-up. Smart contract platforms and decentralized finance protocols have accrued the most value as they fit both of these narratives. Ultimately, the next few years should be pivotal for crypto protocols to realize their potential as censorship-resistant next generation applications, instead of merely a risky bet.

    "title": "Coinbase IPO Propels a Risk-On Market: A Data Perspective by IntoTheBlock",
    "detailedContent": "Every week, IntoTheBlock brings you on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. This week we dive into the anticipated Coinbase IPO and how it is likely to affect markets. We also analyze the performance and correlations of other crypto stocks, and the implications it may have on risk sentiment for crypto markets. Coinbase IPO Propels a Risk-On Market Crypto markets have been roaring towards the $2 trillion total market cap. Despite the recent correction experienced in the past 48 hours, risk-on sentiment remains at least for now. Risk-taking activity can easily be observed from the rotation in assets out of Bitcoin and into altcoins, particularly tokens with lower market capitalization. As of Apr. 7 through CoinMarketCap’s global charts As can be seen in the graph above, Bitcoin’s dominance is 56.3% — its lowest since June 2019. Conversely, the market share of cryptoassets outside of the top 10 is at its highest since August 2020 towards the end of the so-called DeFi summer. The risk-on sentiment may be linked to the upcoming Coinbase IPO. Coinbase will be entering the Nasdaq through a direct listing with the ticker COIN on Apr. 14. Coinbase also recently disclosed its Q1 earnings, where it netted $1.8 billion in revenue, surpassing the total revenue they received in all of 2020. The exchange also reported 6.1 million monthly transacting users. The anticipated IPO will act as a major stamp of approval for crypto markets. Coinbase will instantly become the largest crypto company publicly traded in stock markets. It’s legitimizing effect has been touted by many as a point of inflection in broader acceptance of crypto. However, Coinbase most certainly is not the first crypto company to go public. As a matter of fact, shares in crypto companies such as Marathon Patent Group and Silvergate have been outperforming the market. As of Apr. 7, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Capital Markets Insights While these companies have resulted in a higher return on investment in the past three months, MicroStrategy has underperformed regardless of their continuous Bitcoin investments. Crypto-related companies such as these have unsurprisingly moved in tandem with Bitcoin’s and Ether’s price. As of Apr. 7, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Capital Markets Insights The high correlation between these companies’ stocks and crypto means that there is a positive statistical relationship between the two. Even for companies with consolidated revenue streams outside of crypto, such as Nvidia and PayPal, the correlation is highly strong at 0.62 and 0.54 with Bitcoin, respectively. This trend could suggest that both Bitcoin and large tech companies are being treated as a risk-on play amid the continuing growth of stimulus in the United States. As opportunities for growth in traditional industries decreases, it is likely that more and more investors look into crypto and tech broadly for higher risk opportunities. The Coinbase IPO comes in a pivotal moment: as Bitcoin’s price has failed to sustain above $60K, a catalyst like this could lead to new entrants coming into the market. While there is a significant amount of speculation surrounding this event and the final impact is yet to be seen, it will most certainly mark a milestone for crypto’s history.

    "detailedContent": "The theme of this week is “Silence.” After about two months’ prosperity from October, the crypto market steps into inactivity. It seems like investors have finally calmed down to some extent and breaking news hasn’t seemed to bump up volumes this week. What is also worth mentioning is that Singapore is currently conducting lots of actions to accelerate the layout of its blockchain ecosystem, especially in the field of financial services. No one questions Singapore\u0027s vital position in the global financial ecosystem, therefore, the market is still slowly growing beneath the surface. Let’s look forward to the performance of the crypto market next year. Trading Volume Shrinks, But the Future Is Still Expectable Unlike the hot stock market, the crypto market is quiet in December this year. Compared with last week, the trading volumes of main cryptos shrank more than a quarter in both the spot market and contracts market, taking it back to the same levels seen in October. Although Bitcoin’s price dropped from $19,500 to lower than $18,000 during this period, there is no significant increment of trading from the probable panic.

Source: tokeninsight.com Market Sentiment Implied in Three Indicators Some analysts believe that this silent atmosphere very likely happens near the end of each year. Lots of investors and traders clear their inventory for vacation and are waiting to re-enter the market after Christmas and the new year. Perhaps this is true, but not always the case. We can find some clues from the crypto options and futures market. The funding rate is a useful indicator and is able to reflect the change of confidence in the market. From the perspective of BTC, the perpetual contracts’ funding rate turned negative, which means that more traders are holding short positions, and they don’t have that much confidence in the short-term market. Funding rates of BTC in the last 30 (Up) / 90 (Down) days, chart from 9pm EST, Dec. 10. Source: tokeninsight.com Similarly, ETH contract volatility of funding rates has decreased and been concentrated near the 0% line, which means that the scales of investors with long positions and short positions are roughly the same, and all of them are still holding their assets to see the trends of the market. Another clue is open interest. Unlike trading volumes, open interests in futures and contracts are still maintained at a high level. Compared to the booming of November, there is no trend about volatility at the present. This illustrates that investors are not trading frequently or clearing their inventories for Christmas. They are just watching the fluctuation and waiting for a good chance. Furthermore, implied volatility also hides some information. Generally speaking, implied volatility reflects unequivocal future anticipations of market performance, and investors will sell options with higher volatility and buy options with lower volatility, so analysts are able to know what traders are thinking about by this indicator. From the perspective of the recent volatility surface, we can find that investors tend to sell options. According to the concept mentioned above, we speculate that investors lack confidence for the short term of the market. Recent implied volatility surface of BTC options, chart from 11:00am EST, Dec. 10, Source: gvol.io However, investors are still keeping enough confidence in the long-term future. On one hand, the forward volatility surface illustrates that investors are tending to buy options, which implies positive predictions from the aggregated market. On the other hand, from the perspective of the term structure of implied volatility, the market is in a state of contango, indicating that the possible peak of trading will come next year.

Recently, Singapore has issued the Payment Services Act, PSA. However, according to the information from the website of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MSA), there is no company with the license yet. According to research from TokenInsight, MAS tends to give licenses to traditional financial institutions, although lots of new companies applied for the PSA license, including exchanges and wallets. Singapore is not having the same peaceful week as the crypto markets. The Singapore government approved an investment of $9,000,000 into blockchain research and development on Monday. Government-backed DBS Bank’s digital exchange will begin providing crypto trading services for institutional clients and accredited investors next week. Swiss digital exchange will also build a crypto exchange in Singapore with Japan’s SBI Holdings, slated for launch in 2022. On Thursday, Singapore published the Singapore Blockchain Ecosystem Report 2020, finding that blockchain is the breakthrough of financial services for Singapore. Singapore has applied blockchain to central bank digital currency (CBDC) research, business networks, AML/CFT, the first digital bond issuance, and other areas. Compared with Hong Kong and Tokyo, Singapore\u0027s advantages in IT technology have enabled it to succeed in the blockchain industry. In addition, according to anonymous sources, Singapore has already begun to take steps in compliance with crypto assets. It is believed that compliance related to digital asset transactions will be implemented in Singapore as soon as possible. However, unlike Hong Kong and Tokyo, Singapore can only rely on itself. Let us wait and see.

    "title": "Crypto Outperforms Traditional Markets With DEX Tokens Leading the Way: A Data Perspective by IntoTheBlock",
    "detailedContent": "Every week, IntoTheBlock brings you on-chain analysis of top news stories in the crypto space. Leveraging blockchain’s public nature, IntoTheBlock’s machine learning algorithms extract key data that provide a deeper dive into the major developments in the industry. This week, we analyze crypto’s sign of maturity as it weathers a storm hitting U.S. equities. Moreover, we dive into the upcoming catalysts crypto and DEX tokens in particular are set to benefit from in the short-term. Crypto Outperforms Macro Sell-Off With DEX Tokens Likely to Continue Despite traditional markets experiencing a significant correction, crypto has outperformed remaining close to its all-time highs. Over the past couple of weeks, major American stock indices such as the S\u0026P500 and the Nasdaq100 incurred losses while Bitcoin and Ethereum recorded gains. As of Mar. 2, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s capital markets insights The difference in behavior between crypto and traditional markets shows crypto evolving and acting again as an uncorrelated asset class after being highly correlated throughout most of 2020. This trend points to the consolidation of crypto as a separate asset class, less affected by turbulence in traditional markets. As of Mar. 2, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s capital markets insights Bitcoin’s correlation with major indices is for the most part relatively low (close to zero), while Ethereum does show slightly higher correlations as evidenced by the chart above. Interestingly enough, the correlation with the US dollar index has also declined in spite of crypto-assets often being denominated in dollars and the American currency gaining value in recent weeks. Despite the recent correction, markets are likely to be positively impacted by the upcoming $1.9 trillion stimulus package. Additionally, the $100 billion Coinbase IPO is also likely to generate traction for crypto markets, specifically for centralized and decentralized exchange (DEX) tokens. DEX Tokens Benefitted by Key Catalysts Though there are major differences between Coinbase and decentralized exchanges, they can be compared head to head in terms of trading volume (the vast majority of Coinbase\u0027s revenue comes from trading fees). Over the past week, Coinbase has traded on average $2.61 billion per day. In contrast, Uniswap has settled approximately $955 million per day, but at a significantly cheaper valuation of $16 billion. As of Mar. 10, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s Uniswap Protocol Metrics To put the comparison clearly, Coinbase is currently trading at 38.31 times its daily trading volume, while Uniswap is valued at 16.75 times its volume. If UNI closes this gap versus Coinbase’s valuation, it could expect an increase of over 2.2x in price all else being equal, while SUSHI and BNT could grow even further to close this gap. Asides from the Coinbase IPO, stimulus checks coming within the next two weeks may further add to the risk-on momentum. As stocks recover from the recent correction, the risk-on sentiment appears to still be present as evidenced by Roblox’s recent IPO, with its $37 billion valuation pricing it over 40 times price-to-sales (P/S). In comparison, Uniswap, Bancor and SushiSwap are being priced at 25, 16 and 8 P/S ratios respectively. With the stimulus checks approaching, it would be surprising for these multiples not to expand. Blockchain data supports the trend of bullish positioning among investors in DEX tokens. Centralized exchange flows point to high amounts of UNI in particular being withdrawn. Netflows, which measure the amount of tokens being deposited into exchanges minus those being withdrawn, have reached a new low of $82 million in a day for UNI. In other words, $82 million more UNI were withdrawn than deposited into centralized exchanges on Mar. 8. The magnitude of UNI withdrawals from centralized exchanges points to the likelihood of recent investors opting to hold their positions and/or deposit them for extra yield in DeFi protocols. Moreover, UNI has also seen vast levels of trading activity amongst institutional players. IntoTheBlock’s large transactions volume, which tracks the aggregate volume sent across transfers of over $100,000, acts as a proxy for institutions’ and whales’ trading. As of Mar. 10, 2021 using IntoTheBlock’s UNI financial indicators Large transactions volume for UNI recently took off to a new all-time high of over $5 billion. The increase in institutional activity coincided with a 10% increase in price, suggesting a high likelihood of large players buying the token. Overall, investors in DEX tokens appear to be showing signs of confidence. With Coinbase’s high valuation in its upcoming IPO and stimulus checks set to begin distribution, DEX tokens are poised to continue to grow.

    "detailedContent": "‍CoinMarketCap Earn, an educational program that teaches users about cryptocurrencies in exchange for crypto rewards, is launching their next Earn campaign with FIO Protocol. CoinMarketCap users can watch educational videos to learn about FIO Protocol, then test their knowledge with a short quiz — if they get the quiz answers correct, they will receive a reward in FIO tokens! This CoinMarketCap Earn campaign for FIO has a reward pool of 125,000 FIO (about $50,000). Successful quiz takers will receive 20 FIO (about $8 per user until the rewards pool runs out). What’s Up With Earn? For this earn campaign, only CMC users with Binance Know-Your-Customer-verified accounts BEFORE taking the campaign will be able to participate in the CoinMarketCap FIO Protocol campaign — this is to guarantee a smooth token distribution process for our quiz winners. While in the future, CoinMarketCap Earn campaigns may expand to using other exchanges, only Binance KYC accounts are able to receive FIO rewards in the FIO Protocol campaign. MAKE SURE THAT YOUR ACCOUNT IS ALREADY BINANCE KYC-VERIFIED BEFORE YOU COMPLETE THE QUIZ! We have made the decision to offer the Earn campaign to Binance KYC accounts due to the inherent blockchain risks for on-chain settlement of large rewards pools. The internal distribution of rewards by Binance to KYC-verified users helps ensure that the rewards are delivered in a safe and timely manner, as well as prevents fake accounts from taking rewards. Who’s Ready to Earn FIO? Before you can begin earning FIO, you must make an account on CoinMarketCap, which can easily be done right here. Once you’re in your CMC account, go to the CoinMarketCap FIO page to watch a series of educational videos about the project — and don’t forget to pay attention! Once you finish watching the videos, you will be able to take a short quiz — you can only take the quiz once, so it might be a good idea to take notes! If you successfully complete the quiz, you will receive 20 FIO (~$8) as a reward! What Is FIO? FIO Protocol is a blockchain protocol that aims to create a more efficient way of sending and receiving coins and tokens. FIO Protocol’s high level goal is to deliver usability for the entire blockchain ecosystem — similar to what HTTP did for the internet. FIO Protocol acts as a decentralized layer to the whole blockchain ecosystem, supplying workflow, data and confirmations leading up to transactions on other blockchains. However, the FIO Protocol does not actually interact directly with any other blockchain, but with a blockchain’s endpoints. The FIO token was made to pay for transactions on the blockchain. What Is Earn? CoinMarketCap Earn enables crypto enthusiasts to learn more about a particular cryptocurrency. Each user watches a series of educational videos about an asset, completes a quiz and is rewarded for their correct answers with crypto. With CoinMarketCap Earn, CMC can increase the breadth of knowledge about the crypto industry as part of its goal of showcasing the cryptocurrency revolution each step of the way. A CoinMarketCap account is required for users to participate in the educational CoinMarketCap Earn campaigns. Please remember that not all jurisdictions are supported at this time, so confirm that your jurisdiction is supported by checking out our FAQ section.

    "title": "Right on the DOT - Polkadot and On-Chain Intelligence: Flipside Crypto",
    "detailedContent": "What’s Up With DOT? Polkadot offers a solution to one of the most pressing challenges facing Ethereum: scalability. At the time of writing, the Ethereum network handles about 15 transactions per second. We can validate this with the help of Etherscan and some simple math: Figure 1. Ethereum Daily Transactions A total of 1,277,890 transactions occurred this past Sunday. Divided by 86,400 seconds in a day, this yields ~14.8 transactions per second. By contrast, credit card payment systems process thousands of transactions per second. Not a good look for Ethereum 1.0. If you’ve ever heard of sharding — this is the problem it’s intended to solve (1). In the current version of Ethereum, every node — that is, every computer participating in the Ethereum network — has to process every transaction in the entire history of the blockchain in order to validate transactions. Polkadot provides an alternative to Ethereum 2.0, although it is not a direct competitor. Dr. Gavin Wood, who co-founded Ethereum and created Polkadot, highlights a number of conceptual differences between Polkadot and Ethereum 2.0. In his own words, “Polkadot...is built to be a largely future-proof harness able to assimilate new blockchain technology as it becomes available without over-complicated decentralised coordination of hard forks (3).\" With that said, Polkadot also uses sharding to address a number of blockchain architecture challenges (4). It establishes a main chain, the “relay chain,” to which separate shards or “parachains” can connect. The relay chain is a proof-of-stake (PoS) system; in conjunction with validators, it provides security to the various parachains and enables on-chain governance. Polkadot launched in May 2020, drawing attention from well-known projects such as Chainlink (5). According to Dr. Wood’s year-end review of the Polkadot ecosystem, “Polkadot is now the 2nd most active DeFi ecosystem after Ethereum (and growing fast) (6)”. Retail investors have taken note in 2021; year-to-date, DOT is up nearly 400%. Figure 2. DOT Price, Year-To-Date (2021) CoinMarketCap, https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polkadot-new/ Polkadot: A Healthy Developer Community Each blockchain is unique, and Polkadot’s blend of complexity and innovation makes it especially difficult for non-experts to understand. One way to approach complex projects like Polkadot is on-chain intelligence, which uses data gathered from a project blockchain itself to provide rich insights and enable comparisons with other projects. For example, analyzing blockchain data enables viewers to compare the activity of developer communities. Looking at Polkadot, we see that its recent developer activity compares favorably to the cream of the crop — the top-ranking projects in the crypto universe. A high developer score means that a project has an active developer community: a large number of contributors making regular updates. While projects may vary widely in technical architecture and goals, developer activity provides a common and easily understood metric by which projects can be compared, e.g. how many people are contributing to a project’s health and feature set? Here’s a granular look at developer contributions. The key takeaway is that Polkadot shows consistent contributions (i.e. surges of activity), indicating a dedicated developer community that stays committed to the project over time. Figure 4. Developer Contributions to Polkadot Metrics, like price, are reactive — they can tell you that a large number of buyers have become interested in purchasing tokens. A better standard to examine when assessing a project is: does it have an active, engaged community of developers who are committed to making the project better by adding features and addressing vulnerabilities? By that standard, Polkadot is an excellent example of a project that has attracted regular developer activity over time — and is now enjoying its moment in the limelight as a result.

    "detailedContent": "Don\u0027t have time to read? Check our video instead! ⬇️ CoinMarketCap\u0027s watchlist feature is a great way to keep track of all of your favorite coins and tokens. Instead of having to toggle through multiple tabs and manually check out prices, you can add coins you are interested in to a customized watchlist and check on the market in one place! Your watchlist will sync between your mobile app and your laptop, making sure that you always know how your coins are doing. Before using the CoinMarketCap watchlist, you’ll need to create an account or log in to your existing account. How to Make the Best Use of CoinMarketCap’s Watchlist Now, it’s time to start using the new watchlist! Here is a step-by-step guide to using the CoinMarketCap watchlist. Step 1: Create Your Own Watchlist You can build your own watchlist from these following spots: ‍From the watchlist page: When you go to the main page of watchlist, you can add coins from an empty page: Or from the “+Add Coins” button on the upper right corner: Once you click on the add coin buttons, you can search your favorite coins from the pop-up:‍ - You can also add coins from the coin listings page from the ⭐️ in the front of a coin when you browse - ⭐️s also appear on coin detail pages — when you check out the details of a coin and find it interesting, you can also add that coin directly to your watchlist. Please note if you add coins from the coin listings pages, coins will only be added to the “Main” watchlist (this will be explained below)! Step 2: Customize Your Watchlist You can also customize how you want to view your watchlist with our new beta customization options. Pick the top 12 most important metrics and see how your watchlist changes! Step 3: Share Your Watchlist and Follow Other Watchlists On CMC, you can make your watchlist public or private! If you make a private watchlist, that\u0027s just for you to look at your favorite coins\u0027 price from the comfort of your own home. If you decide to go public, you can attract followers who are interested to see what you are watching. Give your public watchlist a catchy name and description if you want to bring on more followers. You can share your watchlist with the public right on the page, by pressing the \"Share\" button. No matter if your watchlists are private or public, you can easily follow as many public watchlists as you can find! You can find new watchlists (and see which watchlists you are already following) by looking at the Following or Popular tabs. Other CoinMarketCap Watchlist Features Our CMC watchlist feature provides other features that make watching top coins very easy. Multiple watchlists: you can now create more than one watchlist! You can use watchlists for different purposes, like one for DeFi, one for storage and more! Remember that you can give each watchlist a unique name and description so you know what they are about! You can edit the name and description from “... More” button: You can also create new watchlists, or switch to other watchlists from the dropdown next to the watchlist name: ‍Note that there will always need to be one “Main” watchlist amongst your watchlists. This main watchlist will be your default watchlist — when you add coins from ⭐️s mentioned above, it will only be added to the main watchlist. When you go to the watchlist page, this will be the first watchlist shown to you. By default, the main watchlist is set to be the first watchlist you created; however you can swap it anytime in the “... More” list: From here, you can also duplicate/copy a watchlist, or remove/delete a watchlist. If you have an older watchlist... If you have been using our watchlist feature before our latest upgrade, there are two ways of storing your watchlist — either on your local machine (laptop, desktop) or stored with your account. If we detect that you have local stored watchlist data existing, we’ll require you to make a decision of how we should deal with the old data when you first arrive on the new watchlist. There will be three options for you: Merge watchlists: if this option is selected, we will take your local watchlist + account-stored watchlist and make it one watchlist for your future use. Keep local watchlist: if this option is selected, we will then discard your account watchlist and only keep your local watchlist for your future use. Keep account watchlist: if this option is selected, same idea as the previous option that only your account watchlist will be kept. Please note once the decision is made, the data cannot be restored — so make your choice carefully! Reminder: the difference between your “local” watchlist and your “account” watchlist is that one was stored just on your laptop, while the other was associated with your account — under the new watchlist, you’ll have just one watchlist across all devices! Enjoy watching!",

    "detailedContent": "As reflected by the option-related signals on Monday, the performance of mainstream digital assets has shown obvious different trends. Ethereum once again returned to an all time high, while Bitcoin continued to trade sideways at a high level and has not yet achieved a decisive breakthrough. After experiencing the upsurge of NFT, non-Ethereum public chain, on-chain storage and other sectors, investors turned their attention back to the trading sector. The good news in asset trading this week has continued: BTG (Bitcoin Gold) announced its cooperation with Phala Network to build a cross-chain bridge between the Bitcoin network and the Polkadot network, KuCoin Exchange announced the introduction of Stellar deposit and withdrawal services, and the Indian Exchange WazirX announced the launch of the NFT trading market, the first time for a centralized exchange. Stimulated by a lot of good news, trading-related tokens rose as a whole. Bitcoin Callback, Ethereum New High Bitcoin and Ethereum no longer advance at the same time, at least for now. Obviously, the market’s interest in Bitcoin trading is further declining: as of Apr. 9, the weekly trading volume of Bitcoin spot was only 56.5 billion U.S. dollars, while the weekly trading volume of perpetual contracts was 410.6 billion U.S. dollars, a decrease of more than 10%. The decline for Bitcoin was sustained and obvious; while Ethereum was the complete opposite, spot and perpetual contract trading volumes increased by 32.29% and 47.60%, respectively. Changes in the trading volume of Bitcoin and Ethereum in the past 30 days, as of 16:00 on Apr. 9, source: tokeninsight.com The volatility data further showed some additional signals. Whether it is a Bitcoin spot or perpetual contract, its historical volatility has been in a continuous downward trend, and it is now close to 50, a new low this year. The price stability means that speculators are gradually decreasing, but it also means that as speculators gradually lose interest in Bitcoin, the vitality of the market has declined. Historical volatility chart of Bitcoin spot and perpetual contracts since the beginning of the year, source: gvol.io The Ethereum market remains dynamic: the volatility has begun to \"bottom up,\" and the overall volatility level remains above 60, which is much higher than Bitcoin. In addition, from the perspective of options trading in the past week, small option contracts have become the main force in the allocation of rights in this cycle, which confirms the recent activity in the Ethereum market: most small option allocators are individual investors. When option allocation occupies the absolute mainstream, market enthusiasm is often relatively sufficient. Changes in the historical volatility of Ethereum spot and perpetual contracts and changes in the trading volume of Ethereum options in the past 30 days, source: gvol.io Mainstream digital asset transactions this week, source: tokeninsight.com XRP Soars and the Trading Token Sector Takes the Lead When Ripple was sued by the SEC, almost all investors believed that this project, which once occupied the fourth largest market capitalization in the digital asset market, had seen its end. However, its token XRP, after experiencing a drop to US$0.25, has risen to more than US$1 since February, breaking a record high since 2021. At the peak of the daily trading volume, it also reached US$10.21 billion with the price surge. XRP price changes in the past 90 days, source: tokeninsight.com As one of the leaders in the payment and transaction industry, Ripple\u0027s successful \"resurrection\" has driven the long-silent trading token sector to rise. Whether it is cross-chain, high-speed trading public chain or exchange new business, the corresponding tokens are greatly stimulated up. As of 5:30 pm on Apr. 9, the total market value of XRP reached US$46.79 billion, an increase of 78.09% compared to last week. The market value distribution of exchange certificates KCS and STX reached US$1.1 billion and US$2.2 billion, and the best performing token is Bitcoin Gold, which has recently announced to join the Bitcoin-Polkadot cross-chain project. Although it is only a legacy of the Bitcoin hard fork that year, the current token price of the project is affected by cross-chain benefits. The current market value is close to 2 billion US dollars. This is an increase of 174.75% from last week. Trading is the core of the digital asset market, and related certificates can be regarded as long-term investment targets. However, because the short-term performance is often inferior to project certificates such as NFTs, its related transactions have been ignored by investors, especially individual investors. However, a large number of blue chip tokens are hidden in trading tokens, so dividing a part of the investment portfolio into non-mainstream trading tokens for long-term holding may have a positive effect on optimizing the long-term performance of the investment portfolio.
