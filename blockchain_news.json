Cyber integrates Optimism’s OP Stack, EigenDA and custom features to provide low fees, high TPS and a user-friendly experience.\" According to a blog post: \"AltLayer will manage the rollup’s technical launch, ongoing management, operations and future upgrades. With AltLayer’s help, Cyber is one of the first OP Stack Chains with Plasma Mode deployed to mainnet. Plasma Mode enables OP Stack chains to leverage alternative data availability (DA) layers to Ethereum Mainnet, significantly reducing their transaction costs while minimizing tradeoffs to security and decentralization.\"",
