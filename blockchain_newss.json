  "title": "9 Best Blockchain Protocols To Know in 2024",
  "detailedContent": "From foundational layer-1 networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum to innovative layer-2 solutions enhancing scalability and reducing gas fees, this article covers the best blockchain protocols to know in 2024. Discover how smart contracts and consensus algorithms are creating more secure and efficient ways to transact. Plus, browse the native coins and tokens powering these crypto protocols into the bull run and beyond. Blockchain protocols are the backbone of cryptocurrencies and ensure that all transactions are secure, transparent, and immutable — meaning they can’t be altered or deleted. When we talk about crypto protocols, we’re referring to the specific systems that different cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin or Ethereum, use to ensure their networks run smoothly and securely. Each crypto has its own unique protocol. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller directly written into the lines of code. Smart contracts are a key feature of many blockchain protocols, enabling more complex transactions and applications. The easiest way to understand the importance and magnitude of a specific crypto protocol is to consider the dominance of its native crypto. For instance, for the Bitcoin blockchain, the crypto we’re looking at is of the same name, often abbreviated as its ticker, BTC. As of March 29, 2024, Bitcoin, the first-ever blockchain and crypto, maintains its dominance. According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin’s dominance sits at 51.53%. This is the most traded crypto, followed by Ether (ETH) at 16.38% dominance. In the blockchain ecosystem, different layers can help to solve different problems. Layer-1 refers to the main blockchain architecture (like the Bitcoin network or Ethereum). These blockchains can become congested as use rises, leading to issues like slow transaction times and high gas fees — the cost to complete a transaction or execute a contract on the Ethereum network. Layer-2 solutions address these issues, working on top of the layer-1 blockchain to improve scalability — the ability of the network to handle a larger number of transactions quickly and cheaply. Layer-2 solutions process transactions separately and then record them on the main blockchain, reducing the load and, hence, the gas fees. Layer-0 chains combine technologies and protocols that underpin the blockchain ecosystem. The layer includes networking protocols, physical hardware, and other elements. Transactions are verified on a blockchain through a consensus algorithm. The most common types are proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS). Proof-of-work, used by the Bitcoin network, involves crypto mining. During the crypto mining process, miners solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions. Note that this process uses a lot of energy. On the other hand, proof-of-stake (PoS) is a more energy-efficient method. Here, validators are selected based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold and are willing to stake or lock up as a form of security. Cryptocurrency primarily serves as the digital coin or token that operates within blockchain networks. In blockchain systems like the Bitcoin network, cryptos are essential for compensating the participants who maintain the network, known as miners. These miners use their computational power to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. In return for their efforts, they are rewarded with cryptocurrency. Similarly, in blockchains that use a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, participants, often referred to as stakers, lock up a certain amount of their cryptocurrency as a stake in the network. They are then selected to validate transactions and create new blocks based on the amount of crypto they hold and are willing to stake. This method not only secures the network and processes transactions but also rewards those who participate in maintaining the integrity of the blockchain. Blockchain protocols are the rulebooks for how data is handled on blockchain networks. Each one is different, and various algorithms and methods are used to keep data secure, transparent, and up-to-date. These protocols do share commonalities, though, with many utilizing a native crypto: a coin or token that powers the ecosystem. Users looking to invest in the native cryptos of top blockchain protocols should remember that decentralized assets can be volatile. Always choose a safe and secure platform to conduct transactions and a reputable crypto wallet to store your assets. Never invest more than you can afford to lose.",

  "title": "Binance Will End Support for USDC on This Blockchain Next Week",
  "detailedContent": "Binance plans to halt USDC transactions via the Tron (TRC20) network starting from April 5, 2024, at 02:00 UTC. This move is in response to Circle’s cessation of USDC on the same network. Circle recently announced it would be discontinuing support for USDC on the Tron Blockchain. Accordingly, Binance advises that post the deadline, USDC deposits through TRC20 won’t be processed. Yet, this change won’t impede USDC trading on Binance, which remains operational. Moreover, the exchange assures that USDC dealings on other networks are not impacted, promising uninterrupted service across diverse blockchains. Furthermore, Binance stated the stablecoin will still be available for deposits and withdrawals on other blockchains: This strategic update reflects a larger industry-wide recalibration as major cryptocurrency firms reassess their operational frameworks to better align with evolving regulatory landscapes and market demands. Circle’s decision to phase out USDC support on the TRON network demonstrates a careful approach aimed at upholding the integrity and utility of the USDC token on more universally accepted networks. Read More: A Guide to the Best Stablecoins in 2024 For retail users and non-Circle clients with USDC on the TRON network, the best step is to move their holdings to a suitable exchange. This ensures a seamless shift to a blockchain that supports USDC. It allows users to handle their assets well during this change. In essence, Circle’s strategic adjustment, together with Binance’s agreement, signifies the dynamic evolution of the crypto sector. As entities like Circle and Coinbase aim for public trading status in the US, their operational choices reflect a strong commitment to regulatory compliance and market steadiness. Binance’s response to these developments highlights its commitment to offering a reliable and robust trading platform for its worldwide clientele.",

  "title": "Impact of Blockchain Technology in the Gaming Industry",
  "detailedContent": "When the blockchain first burst onto the scene, the sentiment was that it was a revolutionary technology that could affect the finance industry and change how we carry out transactions with cryptocurrencies. While this has been the case, many other industries have been affected by blockchain technology. One of such industries is the gaming industry. Gaming is gaining a lot from incorporating blockchain into the ecosystem. And while crypto enthusiasts have embraced the revolution in the blockchain gaming space, the larger traditional gaming community still has not come around to the technology. Regardless of this resistance, we cannot deny that the gaming scene is no longer a one-size-fits-all experience. The days of limited ownership and centralized control are fading away fast. Blockchain technology has brought a revolution unlike any power-up ever encountered. From reimagining classic gaming genres to weaving interactive dystopian narratives, blockchain games are transforming how we play, earn, and make connections. In this article, we’ll delve into blockchain gaming, its impact, benefits, and future. Blockchain gaming, in simple terms, is playing games that incorporate elements of blockchain technology. With traditional games, you could earn in-game assets for your efforts, and that served as a form of reward that made you feel a sense of progress and ownership in the game. But with blockchain games, you earn rewards in the form of in-game items minted as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), which allows you to trade them on an open marketplace for fiat or other cryptocurrencies. With games like this, there is a complete sense of ownership as they allow players to own the items they earn or unlock as they play. In addition, blockchain games are less susceptible to asset loss, unlike traditional games. There have been instances where a traditional game’s servers have faced lagging and crashing, which caused players to lose valuable in-game items. Imagine if such a game used blockchain technology, those items would still be in the player’s wallets because they are minted as NFTs. In 2022, the global blockchain gaming market size was valued at $4.83 billion. This number will expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 68.3% between 2023 and 2030. Over the past decade, we have seen a significant rise in the popularity of blockchain games. According to DappRadar, in January 2024, the blockchain gaming ecosystem reached 1.5 billion daily unique active wallets (UAW). This was 28% of January’s entire industry activity. We cannot deny the impact of the technology on the industry. Apart from the increase in usage, the games using this technology give players an alternative means of earning money. Axie Infinity was the first major game that embodied the play-to-earn gaming model. In this game, players could breed and train Axies (NFT creatures) that they could sell whenever they wanted for cryptocurrency. This game helped people make a significant side income from rewarding players. At its peak in 2021, the average Axie Infinity player could earn about 4,500 SLP tokens ($800) monthly. Blockchain games also provide game developers with a way to earn money for their efforts. Developers can earn royalties on secondary sales of the assets in their games. NFTs are a vital feature in the blockchain gaming world. They are unique assets that gamers can earn, use in-game, purchase, and sell on marketplaces to other gamers. These NFT assets are generally valuable because they are produced in limited quantities, which promotes their scarcity and ultimately adds to their value. Night of The Living Dead (NTLD), Lussa, Outlanders, and QORPO are fitting examples of this. NTLD is an innovative addition to the Battle Royale genre of gaming where you can choose to play solo or team up with friends to survive a zombie-infested landscape and earn tokens while at it. Lussa represents an immersive narrative set in a dystopian future. A choose-your-own-adventure story where the player’s decisions impact the game’s narrative and determine the fate of humanity. Outlanders is an Open-World MMORPG utilizing blockchain technology to onboard the masses while prioritizing user experience with intuitive interfaces and high-quality graphics. The game is helping bridge the gap between traditional and blockchain gaming. QORPO is a blockchain-powered developer with a mission to make eSports accessible to everyone. They are powering the hero shooter game Citizen Conflict that merges fast-paced gameplay with eSports intensity for ultimate competitive action. Some NFTs are transferable across various games because of their compatibility with different blockchains. This is a prime example of how interoperability works in the blockchain. The blockchain secures these NFTs, and their authenticity and ownership can be traced and assured. There are several unique benefits that blockchain technology offers players and developers. With traditional gaming, game publishers have sole and complete control of the game, all the data, and its servers. Every decision is taken by the company that developed the game. They may decide to shut down the game with the players left out of that decision-making process. This is unfair to the players who spend their time, money, and effort to play these games. The blockchain is changing this. Game data and assets are stored on the blockchain, which puts information and details about the game on an open ledger for everyone to monitor. Unlike traditional games where players purchase in-game assets that are either unusable or cannot be transferred to another game, blockchain gaming allows players to earn and own assets that they can use in other gaming ecosystems. And because the blockchain is inherently decentralized, games built on it encourage community participation. Blockchain games are often built by members of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) rather than by a corporation. This move makes it harder to compromise or discontinue them. The Ready to Fight (RTF) ecosystem adopts both the DAO and gamified mechanics in its operations. RTF is a digital arena where boxing stakeholders can monetize their content, set up DAOs for platform management, access Move2Earn, PvP games, decentralized ticketing services, etc. As a result of continuous innovation, gaming mechanics is also being adapted to other niches like Watch2Earn. As with Play-to-earn and move-to-earn, users are rewarded for actively participating on blockchain platforms with these models. Web3 users can now get rewarded for viewing the content of their favorite creators. A platform like YouTube with over 2.1 billion active users used to be very creator-focused as it rewarded only creators but that is changing. XCAD is at the forefront of the Watch2Earn revolution and it is rewarding viewers with $XCAD tokens for engaging with their favorite creators and channels. I am confident that the future of blockchain gaming is bright. While blockchain gaming has demonstrably moved beyond the conceptual stage, it’s still in its early stages of development. That we’ve already seen multiple exciting projects and developments in the space in the last couple of years shows you the potential here. Traditional companies like Sony are moving into the NFT gaming sphere with a filed patent for an NFT gaming framework. It is still unknown how the company plans to use this patent. There has also been a lot of institutional money coming into the blockchain gaming industry. According to data from DappRadar, the third quarter of 2023 saw over $600 million in investments flow into the blockchain gaming space. The ecosystem saw a total investment of $2.3 billion that year. This was despite the crypto industry being in a bear market. The influx of significant investments into the blockchain gaming industry suggests a future characterized by rapid growth within the ecosystem over the next few years. Blockchain gaming is blurring the lines between entertainment and financial opportunities. With an emphasis on player ownership, community y, and innovative play-to-earn models, blockchain technology offers a glimpse into a future where gamers are no longer passive participants but stakeholders in the activity they love. Even though challenges like user-friendliness and interoperability exist, the influx of investment, rising adoption rates, and the sheer creativity of developers shows how much potential the industry has.",

  "title": "How WEMIX PLAY is Shaping the Future of Online Gaming with Blockchain Innovation",
  "detailedContent": "Web3, the third generation of internet services, integrates concepts like decentralization, blockchain technologies, and token-based economics. This evolution is not just redefining how we interact with the digital world but also reshaping the gaming industry in profound ways. Web3 gaming stands distinct from traditional gaming models. It transcends the limitations of conventional games by integrating blockchain technology, which offers unparalleled transparency, security, and user autonomy. In Web3 games, the control shifts from developers to the players, enabling true ownership of in-game assets, such as skins, characters, and even game scenarios, through Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). GameFi, a fusion of gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi), further enriches the Web3 gaming landscape. This integration allows gamers to engage in financial strategies such as staking, liquidity farming, and token trading within the gaming environment, thereby elevating the gaming experience to new strategic and economic heights. As we delve deeper into this fascinating world of Web3 gaming, one platform that exemplifies this revolution is WEMIX PLAY. It’s a true innovation in the Web3 gaming space. In this article, we will explore this mega blockchain gaming platform that’s changing the face of digital gaming. WEMADE, through its WEMIX subsidiary, has a vision to integrate blockchain, token, and NFT technology into the gaming industry. WEMADE has evolved from being a pioneer in Korean PC and mobile game development to leading the charge in Web3 game development. WEMIX PLAY is the world’s biggest blockchain gaming platform with over 9 million cumulative users, offering over 35 Web3 games, including the hugely successful MIR4 and its sequel, MIR M: Vanguard and Vagabond, the largest P\u0026E MMORPG in the world. The essence of WEMIX PLAY lies in its ability to return ownership of in-game assets to users and break down the boundaries between games, the real-world economy, and the games themselves. The aim was to create more than a blockchain but to forge a user-centric bridge that melds gaming, finance, and daily transactions.

WEMIX PLAY is designed to support the onboarding process to help developers transform all games into great Web3 games.Within three years, the overall vision is to transform all games into blockchain games, making WEMIX PLAY the ultimate platform for developers wanting to onboard their games. WEMIX PLAY’s unique selling propositions lie in its ability to merge games with reality. It introduces games with integrated features like tokenomics, GameFi, marketplace, and community. These features enable new economic activities within games, blurring the lines between gaming and real-world transactions. Within WEMIX PLAY, there is an impressive roster of games. Among these, MIR4, MIR M, and Yulgang Online stand out. Let’s delve into these fascinating realms. MIR4, a masterpiece in the MMORPG (multiplayer online role-playing game) genre, is available on both PC and mobile devices, and has achieved a record number of 1.4 million concurrent users. It immerses players in large-scale PvP battles, server wars, and massive Boss Raids. The graphics are a visual treat, featuring stylish, oriental-inspired designs.

The call for integrating blockchain’s ‘decentralization and democratization’ with AI has been strongly voiced by Jasper De Maere, Outlier Ventures Research Lead. De Maere recently shared his thoughts on this imperative on Yahoo Finance’s Future Focus. De Maere elucidated, pinpointing the “questionable practices around data privacy and data security” inherent in centralized AI systems. His insights reveal a growing consensus among experts on the necessity of rethinking how we manage and secure AI’s capabilities. Centralized AI, as highlighted by US Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler, could pose a significant threat to the financial system. Read more: Will AI Replace Humans? Gensler feels this is due to the creation of a “monoculture” where reliance on a handful of AI models could precipitate systemic fragility. This vulnerability underscores the need for a shift towards more resilient, decentralized infrastructures. This is an evolution that blockchain technology is uniquely positioned to facilitate. Blockchain’s potential to revolutionize AI also extends beyond just enhancing security and privacy. De Maere proposed using blockchain as, This could ensure the integrity and authenticity of AI-generated content. It is an approach that addresses the complex issue of intellectual property rights in the digital age, where AI-generated art and content proliferate. The demand for greater control over online identities and data privacy is becoming increasingly vocal.

  "title": "Arbiscan: A Comprehensive Guide to Arbitrum Blockchain Explorer",
  "detailedContent": "Arbiscan operates as a comprehensive map charting every nook and corner of the Arbitrum network. This is true regardless of how you intend to use the blockchain explorer — whether you’re a developer coding decentralized applications, a trader who has to check on gas prices frequently, or an analyst piecing together the puzzle of the latest blockchain trends. This comprehensive guide will help you make the most of this versatile tool regardless of your specific needs. Here’s what to know. Arbiscan is a blockchain explorer tailored for the Arbitrum network. Arbitrum is a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum designed to increase transaction speed and efficiency while lowering costs. Arbiscan follows a modus operandi similar to internet search engines, albeit for the blockchain. You can use it to sift through and inspect detailed information on the network’s transactions, smart contracts, addresses, and blocks. That makes it a handy tool for developers, traders, and enthusiasts to track transaction histories, verify contract deployments, or simply explore the network’s activity in real-time. Those are the basic functionality Arbiscan offers. Additionally, it also offers analytics on network health, gas fees, and the overall performance of the Arbitrum layer-2 solution. You can leverage this vast data pool to make informed decisions and ensure congestion-free and cost-effective transactions at any given time. You are in for even more treats if you are a developer — that’s because Arbiscan can be your indispensable resource for debugging smart contracts. It does so by providing invaluable insights into transaction executions and potential errors. As for the broader community, Arbiscan brings a touch of transparency and trust to the Arbitrum ecosystem by making all transaction data publicly accessible and easy to interpret. This way, this nifty crypto tool adds to the decentralized principles that constitute the core of the blockchain community. Arbiscan operates by indexing and organizing the data from the Arbitrum blockchain. It taps into the Arbitrum network and continuously syncs with it to gather new transactions, blocks, and smart contracts as they are confirmed and added. This process involves several key mechanisms: Arbiscan connects to Arbitrum nodes using JSON-RPC, a stateless, lightweight remote procedure call (RPC) protocol. It uses these connections to collect the latest blockchain data, including transactions, smart contract states, and block information. Once the Arbitrum nodes fetch the data, Arbiscan indexes this information to make it searchable. This involves organizing data in a way that can be quickly retrieved based on various search queries, such as transaction hashes, addresses, or block numbers. It also deploys a series of sophisticated database management systems to efficiently process the vast amount of incoming data. Arbiscan makes smart contract interactions understandable by decoding the data with the contract’s Application Binary Interface (ABI). This allows users to see the details of smart contract transactions in a human-readable format rather than just hexadecimal strings. For instance, understanding decoded transaction data is especially important when transferring assets between Ethereum and Arbitrum using the Arbitrum Bridge. Arbiscan employs real-time monitoring tools to track network activity, gas prices, and contract interactions. This involves complex algorithms and data analysis techniques to provide insights into network health, transaction trends, and other relevant metrics. The front end of Arbiscan presents the indexed blockchain data through a relatively intuitive web interface. Users can search for specific items, view detailed analytics, and explore blockchain activities without interacting directly with the Arbitrum network. Some of the key features of Arbican include: It’s clear that Arbiscan is a multi-utility toolkit. You can use it to: Let’s address how to operate each of these utilities. Arbiscan starts counting blocks from zero and then goes upward from there, i.e., zero, one, two, and so on. The number associated with the block is called its height. Each block contains key data such as the time it was mined, the gas used, and the number of transactions it holds, among other info. Let’s say you have made a transaction and want to check the transaction details and status. It’s simple with Arbiscan — all you need to do is enter the transaction ID on the search bar and hit enter. Arbiscan will instantly fetch you an overview of the corresponding transaction. As you can see in the screenshot below, the overview will include the unique ID (it’s called a hash), which block the transaction is from, the corresponding time stamp, the source address, the destination address, and the current status of the transaction. If the status says “pending,” that would mean the transaction is yet to be recorded by a block. A “successful” status means a block has already recorded the transaction. Similarly, if the status reads “failed,” it means the transaction failed or was rejected — it could be due to a technical issue or gas fees. Similar to viewing transaction details, you can use the Arbiscan search bar to look up any ERC-20, ERC-1155, and ERC-721 (NFTs) tokens. Alternatively, you can also go to the “Token” section of the website and view the top tokens. The token overview section reveals the token’s type (e.g., ERC-20), current price, total supply, and holder activity. Meanwhile, the profile summary will fetch details such as the contract address, project website, and social media links. If you want to dig further, the same page fetches additional information like transfers, holder distribution, exchange listings, and even the inner workings of the smart contract itself — all accessible further down the page. Another perk of using Arbiscan is that you can look up individual addresses using the search bar. It could be a wallet address or even a smart contract — you just have to enter the address to get the associated details. On the address page, you will see an overview of the address itself, its ETH balance, the total value of that balance, and the balance by token. Below, you will also see a recent list of incoming and outgoing transactions for that address. This is slightly tricky and requires some technical know-how. Ideally, you should start the process by referring to the Arbiscan API documentation. Here’s a quick overview of the step-by-step procedure you can follow: Arbiscan lets you verify and read smart contracts. If you want to check whether or not a contract is verified, there are a couple of ways to go about it. First, go to the Blockchain section of the website and select “Verified Contracts.” These contracts have undergone a thorough review process, ensuring their code matches the deployed bytecode, enhancing trust and security. Alternatively, you could access an individual smart contract and check the “Contract \u003e Code” segment to know whether or not the code has been verified. In fact, you can dig deeper and review the actual source code yourself. Just head over to the “Tokens \u003e ERC-721 top tokens” section of the website to see a list of top NFTs and information on their total number of transfers on both the 24-hour and seven-day scales. Clicking on individual tokens will fetch further details, including token overviews and profile summaries. Arbiscan gives you a glimpse into gas fees and various gas-related metrics when exploring a transaction. The key gas details you’ll find usually include: While Arbiscan is pretty competent at what it does, it is not the only-of-its-kind tool. Most major blockchains and L2 scaling solutions have their own dedicated block explorers offering similar functionalities. Some of the most popular ones include: Arbiscan does a neat job of closely monitoring all transactions, smart contracts, and blocks on Arbitrum. The only bone of contention for some might be its exclusive focus on the Arbitrum ecosystem. But then, Arbiscan is, by design, an exclusive block explorer on Arbitrum — so it’s more like a strength than a folly. Don’t forget that Arbiscan can also be an indispensable tool in your trading inventory if you are into data-driven decision-making. It charts real-time asset transfers and price movements across Arbitrum, which then gives you a clearer picture of market sentiment and network value flows. Overall, the blockchain explorer offers a cohesive toolkit for users looking to make the most out of the Arbitrum network.",

  "title": "How Protocols Are Interconnected on the Blockchain",
  "detailedContent": "With over ten years of investing and building in fast-growing technology products and the blockchain industry, I’ve come to understand that to stay ahead, providing innovative solutions that can affect the industry and the world at large. I should know. I have invested in many companies with this characteristic. Even though the blockchain industry is still in its nascent stages, plenty of sub-niches and narratives have come to the fore. These technologies are reshaping the blockchain landscape, and in this article, we will delve into this subject, taking you through some of the niches that are revolutionizing their respective areas and how interconnected they are. This sector has seen consistent growth because of its importance to the entire industry. Data privacy and security are vital in today’s blockchain world for obvious reasons. The risks associated with data breaches and cyber-attacks have increased as personal, financial, and confidential information gets increasingly stored and transferred digitally. In 2023, the global average cost of a data breach reached a record high of $4.45 million. This rise in these attacks can be attributed to how the blockchain is structured. It is a ledger containing a record of all transactions taking place on a network. A key feature of blockchain technology is its immutability. Once a block (containing a unique code known as a hash) gets added to the chain, it can neither be altered nor deleted. This provides data stored on the blockchain with tamper-proof security. However, despite what seems to be an airtight layer to the blockchain, some bad actors have succeeded in exploiting the system. In the fight to counter these blockchain exploitations and hackings, privacy-focused protocols have become popular. Think of them as installing a sophisticated alarm system for your digital assets, utilizing clever incentives and independent reputation systems to deter unwanted intrusions. Because we operate in an industry where data breaches cost projects millions, the importance of privacy-focused companies cannot be overstated. COIIN Network Protocol—the parent company of Raiinmaker—is a good example of a company playing in the privacy landscape. Scalability in blockchain refers to the speed of transactions. The ability to support high transaction throughput is both critical and a significant challenge for the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry. And this makes it a very essential aspect in the future growth of blockchain. Achieving an improved level of scalability comes at the cost of reduced decentralization and to a large extent, security. As you note these, it is also important to note that scalability is vital in helping blockchain networks compete effectively with conventional platforms. The question here should now be: how possible is it to provide effective blockchain scalability solutions that do not affect the core tenets of blockchain which are decentralization and security? I present to you layer-1 solutions. Also known as the “first layer,” it requires changes in the code base of the blockchain network. One reason they’re dubbed on-chain scaling solutions. They focus on improving the main features and characteristics of the blockchain network like increasing the block size limit or reducing the block verification time. Ethereum has a transaction speed of around 15 Transactions Per Second (TPS), and Bitcoin is around 7TPS. Both blockchains now have scalability solutions in Sharding and Lightening network respectively, but other solutions are popping up. A popular one is the layer-1 platform Self Chain. It is a Modular Intent-Centric Access Layer-1 blockchain and keyless wallet infrastructure service using MPC-TSS/AA for multi-chain Web3 access. This sector has changed the way the world sees gaming forever. I say this because it is our reality now. Play-to-earn games are a set of blockchain-powered games that allow players to earn in-game rewards represented by Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and tokens. These rewards have real-world value and players can earn them by progressing through the different levels of a game. The in-game assets earned can be weapons, tokens, lands, and skins. Players can trade or transfer these assets on open marketplaces in exchange for real fiat currencies. The gaming industry is huge and boasts an impressive number of people actively participating in it. There were over 3 billion gamers in the industry in 2021. This number of people actively engaged in games helped the industry generate hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue. That revenue has been projected to reach $533 billion by 2027. In 2022, the P2E market size was valued at $32.9 billion, and it is expected to grow to $88.6 billion by 2028, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 17.93%. Some of the best P2E platforms in the industry include Axie Infinity, Creo Engine, The Sandbox, Splinterlands, Decentraland, etc. How we carry out transactions and store data has changed since the advent of blockchain technology. Blockchains have their own standards and set of rules that govern them. In most cases, these are rarely compatible with other chains and have led to an ecosystem where blockchains cannot interact due to their silo-styled operation. A solution to this issue is blockchain bridges. These are known as cross-chain bridges because they allow the transfer of tokens and data from blockchain to blockchain. A benefit of bridging in blockchain is being able to expand the functionality of a chain. This is an important tool for communication among different blockchains. A good example of this would be Dechat Protocol, which prides itself as an open, secure web3 communications protocol that powers decentralized user interactions. The largest asset class in the world, the Real Estate sector is another industry where blockchain technology is having a significant impact. A large portion of the world’s economic assets and transactions is constituted by commercial real estate. According to the Boston Consulting Group (BCG), the total size of tokenized illiquid assets, including real estate and natural resources could reach $16.1 trillion by 2030. This proves how big the real estate market is. While traditional real estate investment can be a daunting maze, with high entry barriers and limited accessibility, blockchain technology is slowly demystifying it. Blockchain protocols are now being used to process securities, documents, and accounting, and manage liability. With blockchain technology, you can also own a fraction of a property, which reduces the barrier of entry massively, thereby giving small-scale investors a chance to get into the real estate market. Fractionet is a good example of a protocol currently doing this. While these various niches might seem very distinct, they are all part of the same vibrant ecosystem that’s the blockchain. The privacy-focused protocol can be used to protect sensitive data used in DeFi transactions—a technology that backs the entire play-to-earn gaming economy. The scalable blockchain facilitates seamless communication that the bridge encourages. And think of the fractional ownership platform offering investment opportunities fueled by DeFi liquidity. My point is that these projects intertwine, and they create a synergistic ecosystem where innovation thrives.",
